  "text": "    \"text\": \" Asia Pacific Nations Collaborate to Improve Aviation Safety In the Asia Pacific, MITRE is working with four nations and 12 aviation industry \\norganizations on a project that uses shared aviation information to identify \\npotential safety issues and address them before serious incidents can occur. In the fall of 2017, with MITRE's support, several Asia Pacific governments and airlines launched a \\ncollaborative project that uses data sharing to improve aviation safety in the region. The inspiration for the project is a U.S. data sharing initiativethe Aviation Safety Information Analysis \\nand Sharing (ASIAS) program. ASIAS (pronounced \\\"A-sigh-us\\\") is credited with dramatically improving the \\nsafety of commercial aviation in the United States over the last decade. \\\"We're taking that successful U.S. capability and adapting it to the Asia Pacific context,\\\" says Greg \\nNelson, who heads MITRE Asia Pacific Singapore. We established this state-of-the-art research and \\ndevelopment center in 2015 with the support of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS). CAAS also spearheaded the effort to create an aviation safety data sharing program in the Asia Pacific. In \\n2013, CAAS commissioned MITRE to evaluate the feasibility of implementing such a program at the \\nregional level. That study examined a variety of factors, such as the availability of safety data and the \\nunique regulatory, budgetary, and technological environments of the different nations in the region. \\\"In the United States, we have a single regulator and air navigation service provider [ANSP]the Federal \\nAviation Administration,\\\" explains project leader Wallace Feerrar. \\\"But in the Asia Pacific, there is no \\ncentral regulatory authority. Each state governs and regulates its own airspace, ANSP, and the airlines \\ncertificated in that state, so the environment is quite different from the one ASIAS operates in. \\\"That meant we had to take into consideration the unique environments, needs, cultures, and concerns \\nof all the interested parties.\\\" After nine months of study, the research team's findings were in favor of a data sharing initiative. \\nGovernment and industry stakeholders in the region also agreed that a regional data collection, analysis, \\nand information sharing effort would enhance the Asia Pacific's ability to identify safety hazards and \\ndevelop targeted safety improvements. MITRE Develops a Framework Suited to the Asia Pacific Context That finding was the green light for further work. Over the next few years, MITRE worked in partnership \\nwith the Flight Safety Foundation (FSF)an aviation safety advocacy organization with members in more \\nthan 150 countriesto develop the framework for an Asia Pacific safety data sharing demonstration \\nproject. Because of its expertise in the governance and administration of intergovernmental programs, FSF \\ndeveloped the framework that would govern data sharing among the program participants. Due to MITRE's technical capabilities, previous experience with data sharing initiatives, and not-for-profit \\nobjectivity, we were selected to serve as the trusted third party that would analyze the regional https://www.mitre.org/publications/project-stories/government-and-industry-collaborate-to-improve-safety-through-data-sharing\\nhttp://www.mitre-ap.sg/\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/news/in-the-news/caas-and-mitre-collaborate-to-establish-air-traffic-management-research-and\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/news/in-the-news/flight-safety-foundation-and-mitre-collaborate-to-transform-global-aviation information that was collected. We would also disseminate findings and facilitate discussions about \\npotential mitigations. To create the demonstration project, MITRE and FSF worked with Asia Pacific government and industry \\nrepresentatives. The group outlined the program's foundation and principles, set clear participant roles \\nand responsibilities, and addressed issues such as how members' information would be protected and \\nshared, and how program decisions would be made. Governments and Industry Join the Effort In 2017, four nationsSingapore, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Japancommitted to participating in \\nand financing the project. At least six other nations have expressed interest in participating as well. \\nAirlines, aircraft manufacturers, and regional trade organizations have also agreed to supply information \\nand subject matter expertise. Created as a demonstration project, the initiative will last three years. During that time, the project will \\npool results and information from participants and analyze safety issues of concern across the region. It \\nwill also provide participants an opportunity to assess and refine the program's structure and benefits. Initial Study Focuses on Mid-Air Collision Risk The demonstration project's initial focus is on mid-air collision risk. \\\"Although mid-air collisions are rare, near-misses sometimes occur,\\\" Feerrar says. \\\"By tracking those \\nincidents and analyzing the data associated with them, we can better understand why they are occurring \\nand recommend mitigations.\\\" To conduct that analysis, MITRE is using a combination of state-provided reports, data airlines have \\nsupplied to their regional trade organizationthe International Air Transport Association (IATA)and a \\nglobal dataset we have compiled over the last several years. \\\"Several years ago, we established licensing agreements with global vendors of Automatic Dependent \\nSurveillance-Broadcast [ADS-B] datasets,\\\" Feerrar says. ADS-B is equipment that allows aircraft to \\nbroadcast their positions to similarly equipped aircraft and ground stations. \\\"It's pseudo-radar, \\nessentially,\\\" he explains. \\\"We now have a three-year archive of that data, and it's helping inform our \\nresearch in the Asia Pacific.\\\" Already, MITRE researchers have identified several mid-air collision risk hot spots that warrant additional \\nstudy. \\\"These incidents are occurring more commonly at the seamsat the borders between countries in the \\nregion,\\\" Feerrar says. \\\"Our analysis is ongoing, but we've already begun to identify the traffic flows and \\nthe factors in normal operations that are causing these incidents. \\\"By fall 2018, we believe we'll have a more complete understanding of the situation and can make \\nrecommendations for some potential fixes.\\\" Marlis McCollum Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.
