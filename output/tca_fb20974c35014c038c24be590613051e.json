  "text": "year, and the traffic pattern in that year \\nwill depend on a specific day, particularly in relation to the weekend. To uncover the \\nholiday traffic pattern, the days relative to the holidays are compared for the years 2010 to \\n2014. Figure 14 shows the percentage variance in traffic from a 60-day mean around \\nThanksgiving Day for the Florida airspace. Days relative to Thanksgiving Day are labeled as \\nT+/-<relative day>, for example T-1 means the day before Thanksgiving. \\nFigure 14. Historical Traffic Patterns during Thanksgiving The figure shows that the Wednesday before and Sunday after Thanksgiving Day tend to be \\nbusy, while day after Thanksgiving is light in traffic across all the years. Figure 15 shows the percentage variance in traffic from a 60-day mean around July 4 for the \\nCape Canaveral site. The chart shows no specific trend, since July 4 may fall on a different \\nday of the week each year, which in turn influences overall traffic trends (i.e., a Wednesday \\nholiday may not produce increased demand whereas a Monday or Friday holiday may). 20 Figure 15. Historical Traffic Pattern during July 4 \\nFor holidays, that fall on the same day of the week (such as the Thanksgiving Day), the \\nmodel selects historical days that are same relative days compared to the holiday. For other \\nholidays, no special processing is used. In this model, the holidays during which unusual traffic is anticipated are: Memorial Day Labor Day Thanksgiving Day Christmas Day Adapt Projection Model for Use in the Route Segment Density Map The projection model described above needs to be encoded in the Route Segment Density \\nmap to support an on-demand projected impact assessment capability. The impact \\nassessment model used to assess historical impacts described earlier can then be used to \\nassess future impacts as well. In Section IV (Data Reduction and Encoding), bidirectional traffic traversing route segments \\nis aggregated to generate a Route Segments Density map of the historical traffic. Route \\nsegments can also be used to store the projected bidirectional traffic density to generate a \\nProjected Route Segment Density map. The projected traffic density of a route segment can \\nbe derived based on the projection model described above (i.e., by using the distribution of \\nits usage across 30 historical days selected by the projection model). 21 One potential issue with this approach is that fixes \\nand waypoints used by traffic in an area may change \\n(or fixes can be renamed) over a period (six years is \\nused for this research). This would result in a route \\nsegment not appearing in all the past years, thus \\nresulting in less than 30 days sample data to project \\nfor that route segment. Table 4 shows historical \\ndays that had the flight counts for the busiest 20 \\nroute segments (shown earlier in Table 1). Analysis \\nof route segments in the top 2.5 percentile (450 \\nroute segments) in terms of usage showed an \\naverage number of historical days to be 23.8, which \\nis considered acceptable for this model. Section VIII \\ndiscusses other approaches that can improve the \\nmodel sample size. Since usage patterns of fixes and waypoints change \\nover time, route segments used in the year prior to \\nthe projected year are used to make the projections. To summarize, steps to project for day Dp, at Hour Hp occurring in Week Number Wp in the \\nyear Yp are: Select the surrogate day Ds from the previous year (Yp -1) as one that is same day of the a.\\nweek as Dp and in the Week number Wp.\\nFor each route segment in the Route Segment Density map for day Ds, get the b.\\ndistribution of the traffic density for historical days using the traffic projection model. \\nFewer than 30 days may be selected, as discussed before.\\nCompute the mean value, 25 percentile, and 75 percentile values as the range of c.\\nprojected traffic density for that route segment.\\nRepeat steps b and c for each hour of the day, to store it in the Projected Route Segment d.\\nDensity map.\\nThe Projected Route Segment Density map can be used to project traffic for any blocked e.\\nairspace based on segments that intersect the airspace. The projection model encoded in the Route Segment Density map uses the distribution of \\nroute segments in the previous years to generate mean, low, and high estimates of \\npredicted impact. Using a value based on a large sample size reduces the effect of outliers in \\nthe historical usage counts. Preliminary Results of Using the Projection Model and Discussion There is innate randomness in the traffic pattern in the NAS, which will limit the accuracy of \\nany projection model to predict it. This model targets relatively long-term horizon of 12 \\nmonths and at one-hour granularity, and is not expected to yield high-fidelity results.

The approach used to assess the efficacy of this \\nmodel is to compare its results with an alternate traffic projection model, as well as with \\nobserved impacts based on actual flight paths. The model is developed using historical \\ntraffic from the year 2011 to 2015, the tracks from 2016 are used to assess the results. The following comparisons are performed: Comparison to a projection model that uses TAF5 average (2.0 percent) growth applied to the previous years traffic as a proxy for the next year\\nComparison of trends of the moving average of actual impacts to the moving averages of projected low and high values for the year\\nPercentage of times the actual impact values fall within the predicted low to high range All the comparisons are performed on a set of test airspace areas listed in Table 2. Comparison with Projection Based on the Previous Year Traffic Model The truth data is first generated as the daily number of flight tracks intersecting the test \\nareas of airspace (see Table 1) to arrive at a total of 365 data points (February 29 is \\nignored) for the year 2016. These are termed Actual intersections. Next, the projection using the previous year traffic model is generated. This model projects \\nby applying a growth factor to the prior year traffic. The daily traffic in the year 2015 is \\nused to find the number of flights that will intersect the test areas of airspace. A growth \\nfactor of 2.0 percent is applied to the result to arrive at 365 projections for the year 2016. \\nThese projections are termed Prior-year based. The difference between actual and \\nprojected value (actual minus projected) is a measure of error. Finally, the model is used to project demand for each day in 2016, where these projections \\nare termed Model-based. The difference between actual and model projected values is a \\nmeasure of error for the model; this is compared to observed error for the Prior-year based \\nmodel, and results are shown in Table 5. Table 5. Comparison between Prior-Year Based and Model-Based Projection Accuracy Airspace Mean (Error) Std Dev (Error)\\nModel Prior-Year Model Prior-Year East 3.48 -9.53 45.63 62.68\\nFlorida -4.4 4.54 16.24 22.97\\nCenter 0.90 13.89 36.09 41.03\\nWest -1.76 4.28 18.12 20.83 23 North-West -8.53 8.90 9.78 14.97 The results show that the Model-based projections are consistently more accurate than the \\nPrior-Year based projections, indicated by lower mean and standard deviation of error for \\nall of the areas of airspace. Comparison of Trends of Actual vs Estimated Range Seven-day moving averages of actual intersections are plotted along with moving averages \\nof low and high estimates of the model for all test areas of airspace in Figure 16. 1/1/20161/3/20161/5/20161/7/20161/9/2016 2/2/20162/4/20162/6/20162/8/2016 3/1/20163/3/20163/5/20163/7/20163/9/2016 4/2/20164/4/20164/6/20164/8/2016 5/2/20165/4/20165/6/20165/8/2016 6/1/20166/3/20166/5/20166/7/20166/9/2016 7/1/20167/3/20167/5/20167/7/20167/9/2016 8/2/20168/4/20168/6/20168/8/2016 9/1/20169/3/20169/5/20169/7/20169/9/2016 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 N\\num be\\nr O f I\\nnt er\\nse ct\\nin g \\nFl ig\\nht s Actual (Moving Average) Low (Moving Average) High (Moving Average) East Airspace Actual vs Estimated Range 1/1/20161/3/20161/5/20161/7/20161/9/2016 2/2/20162/4/20162/6/20162/8/2016 3/1/20163/3/20163/5/20163/7/20163/9/2016 4/2/20164/4/20164/6/20164/8/2016 5/2/20165/4/20165/6/20165/8/2016 6/1/20166/3/20166/5/20166/7/20166/9/2016 7/1/20167/3/20167/5/20167/7/20167/9/2016 8/2/20168/4/20168/6/20168/8/2016 9/1/20169/3/20169/5/20169/7/20169/9/2016 0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80 100\\n120\\n140\\n160\\n180 N\\num be\\nr o f I\\nnt er\\nse ct\\nin g \\nFl ig\\nht s Florida Airspace Actual vs Estimated Range Actual (Moving Average) Low (Moving Average) High (Moving Average) 24 1/2/20161/4/20161/6/20161/8/2016 2/1/20162/3/20162/5/20162/7/20162/9/2016 3/2/20163/4/20163/6/20163/8/2016 4/1/20164/3/20164/5/20164/7/20164/9/2016 5/1/20165/3/20165/5/20165/7/20165/9/2016 6/2/20166/4/20166/6/20166/8/2016 7/2/20167/4/20167/6/20167/8/2016 8/1/20168/3/20168/5/20168/7/20168/9/2016 9/2/20169/4/20169/6/20169/8/2016 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 N\\num be\\nr o f I\\nnt er\\nse ct\\nin g \\nFl ig\\nht s\\nCenter Airspace Actual vs Estimated Range Actual (Moving Average) Low (Moving Average) High (Moving Average) 1/1/20161/3/20161/5/20161/7/20161/9/2016 2/2/20162/4/20162/6/20162/8/2016 3/1/20163/3/20163/5/20163/7/20163/9/2016 4/2/20164/4/20164/6/20164/8/2016 5/2/20165/4/20165/6/20165/8/2016 6/1/20166/3/20166/5/20166/7/20166/9/2016 7/1/20167/3/20167/5/20167/7/20167/9/2016 8/2/20168/4/20168/6/20168/8/2016 9/1/20169/3/20169/5/20169/7/20169/9/2016 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 N\\num be\\nr o f F\\nlig ht\\n In te\\nrs ec\\ntio ns West Airspace Actual vs Estimate",
