  "text": "military missions and an estimate of the situation. Data for decision-making is prepared by the staff, chiefs of combat arms, special troops, and services. Operational planning is usually done with a map and refined on the terrain at the first opportunity. In ground force subunits all work connected with decision-making is as a rule performed on the terrain. The operation plan (battle) is detailed in the operational planning process; it is formally articulated on a map, with an explanatory note appended.[footnoteRef:18] [18: Ibid., p. 634.] In 2003 the Military Encyclopedia defined an operational plan as\\nthe manner, procedure, order, and methods of accomplishing military missions as determined by a commander. It includes the concept of operation (s) (commanders concept), missions of the troops, basic questions for coordination, and the basic organization of command and control.[footnoteRef:19] [19: S. B. Ivanov, Main Editor, Military Encyclopedia, Moscow: Military Publishing House, Vol. 7 2003, p. 229.] A concept of operations was defined in the 1986 Military Encyclopedic Dictionary as \\nbasic decisions about forthcoming combat operations. It determines: the direction or axis of the main attack and other thrusts (areas of concentration of main efforts); the sequence and methods of defeating an adversary; the order for delivering fire for effect and, in a nuclear war, nuclear weapons of destruction; group and operational orders of battle (battle disposition).[footnoteRef:20] [20: Akromeev, p. 264.] The 1995 Military Encyclopedia defined a concept of operations more explicitly as follows:\\nThe basis for a decision to conduct an operation (battle); the main idea for the method by which a force grouping conducts an assigned strategic, operational, or tactical combat mission in a military theater, along a strategic (or operational) axis, or in an area of terrain. In the zone of operation (battle) the following are defined: the areas where the main efforts are concentrated (the axes of the primary and other strikes); the methods for defeating the enemy (which force groupings, where, in what sequence, and how the defeat will be accomplished; the kind of fire or nuclear strike, and measures to deceive the enemy); the force grouping and their operational composition (order of battle).[footnoteRef:21] [21: P. S. Grachev, main editor, Military Encyclopedia, Moscow: Military Publishing House, Vol. 3 1995, p. 238.] Operational Art: Summaries of a Few Important Discussions\\nIf Russia ever did decide to intervene in Europe, whether it be in the Baltics or by attacking Central European countries, or if it decided to conduct operations on a global scale in conjunction with an ally, it is reasonable to assume that the planning of operations and operational art would be a focal point. Operational art is of special interest for its use of front and army operations on a large-scale. The latter has been evident in Russias yearly exercises in specific military districts (south in 2016, west in 2017, east in 2018, central upcoming in September 2019) or their special operational pairing with Chinas military. And not to be forgotten is whether, on a mass scale that includes space, Russia would consider the use of operational art on a planetary scale. \\nThe analysis that follows will initially look at two short summaries from the works of General Aleksander Svechin and General Georgiy Isserson, two of the most prominent Soviet authors on operational art in the pre-World War II period. Their short summaries are followed by several works on operational art in Russia over the past 18 years. Surprisingly, very little has been written on the issue recently. Still, the articles that did appear offer several elements of operational art to consider when theorizing what a larger Russian campaign may look like.\\nGeneral Aleksander Svechin\\nIn the 1927 work Strategy by Aleksandr A. Svechin, the noted Russian theorist, there was a section on operational art. Svechin noted that tactical creativity is governed by operational art, and that operational art sets forth a series of tactical missions and logistical requirements based on the goal of an operation. Operational art depends on the manner in which an operation is conducted, material available, time allotted for tactical missions, forces deployed for battle on a certain front, and the nature of the operation itself. Operational art must take into account the possibilities presented by the immediate rear (front logistics). Only on occasion is an ultimate goal achieved in a single battle with combat operations. Rather, it requires a series of operations separated by pauses in different areas of a theater, due to the immediate goals of forces in these areas. An operation consists of drawing up a plan; logistical preparations; the concentration of forces at the starting position; the building of defensive fortifications; marching; fighting battles that encircle or destroy a portion of an adversarys force and force the withdrawal of other forces due to an envelopment, breakthrough, or holding of a line in a geographical area. An operation can become an act of war if the efforts of troops are directed toward the achievement of a certain intermediate goal in a certain theater of military operations without any interruptions.[footnoteRef:22] Svechins comments provided much of the initial impetus behind the concept of operational art and strongly influenced the years of work on the concept that followed. [22: A. A. Svechin, Strategy, Military Bulletin 1927, as translated and published by East View Publications, Minneapolis Minnesota, 1992, Kent Lee editor, pp. 68-69. The work is preceded with introductory essays on Svechin written by Russian Major-General (retired, now deceased) V. V. Larionov; former Russian Security Council Chief and Deputy Minister of Defense A. A. Kokoshin; former Soviet Chief of the General Staff V. N. Lobov, and noted US historian of Russias military, Jacob W. Kipp.] General Georgiy Isserson\\nIsserson is well known for his seminal work entitled The Evolution of Operational Art. In his preface to the second edition of the work, in May 1936, he wrote the following:\\nThe very essence of operational art presupposes freedom of methods and forms which should be carefully chosen each time to fit a concrete situation. All the propositions we advance in the field of modern operational art should be treated as orienting ideas, which find this or that concrete expression only in a given genuine situation.\\nTherefore, the present work would be of negative value if the ideas it advocates were treated as ready-made schemes. There can be no such schemes in operational art. We aim to show essential distinctions between the conditions of our era with its new forms of the deep operation and the operational art of the past. This is the only significance ascribed to the propositions advanced in the present work.[footnoteRef:23] [23: For a translation of this work, see https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Portals/7/combat-studies-institute/csi-books/OperationalArt.pdf.] Issersons comments accord with the well-established Russian view that there should be no stereotyping in the development of military affairs, a view reiterated by a host of contemporary military theorists. \\nMajor-General E. G. Korotchenko, retired\\nIn 1999, writing in Voennaya Mysl (Military Thought), Korotchenko described where operational art was heading. He noted that the revolution in military art has launched a radical revision of ideas of the place and role, forms and methods of armed, information, and psychological confrontation.[footnoteRef:24] An important trend is that warfare is switching to a functional-structural and selective impact type of operation. This represents a departure from a principle of using force on force to one using the principle of asymmetrical threats. Assets designed to disorganize command and control of an enemy task force are now important, where a key trend is the evolution of operational forms and means of warfare and the emergence of new ones.[footnoteRef:25] The growing potentials of air and space warfare are increasingly influencing the theory and practice of operational art.[footnoteRef:26] The prevention of an enemys domination in space is now important and commanders must employ the potentials of our space-based systems to the utmost when preparing operations and waging hostilities.[footnoteRef:27] This is because the course and outcome of operations are dominated by space and missile forces. [24: E. G. Korotchenko, Operational Art Today: Where It Goes, Voennaya Mysl (Military Thought), No. 1, 1999 (in English), p. 13.] [25: Ibid., p. 14.] [26: Ibid., p. 15.] [27: Ibid.] Maneuver, a typical trend of operational art, has a more important role to play under the current advanced technological situation. Commanders will have to adopt ways to ensure freedom of maneuver. This requires the constant interaction among all services during an operation and an increased reliance on timely logistics. Warfare may be constantly waged along the entire depth of a large strategic formations operational deployment. Finally, there is a trend toward greater complexity in operational planning due to the shorter time for preparations. An adversary can prepare the ground for an operation with information and other techniques long before a military conflict begins. Thus, it is important to study how all of these factors affect operational art and to identify the direction in which it is heading.[footnoteRef:28] [28: Ibid., pp. 15-18.] Colonel-General V. Zherebtsov of the Operational Art Department\\nOn 11 April 2001 the Department of Operational Art at the Military Academy of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General",
