Controllers reported on average that 78.6%\\n(SD=19.7; missing=2) aircraft performing IM and above was / would be reasonable (Figure\\n4-52). Figure 4-51. Controller Responses to There were an acceptable number of aircraft\\nperforming IM Figure 4-52. Controller Responses to There were an acceptable number of aircraft\\nperforming IM What percentage and above is reasonable? 4-60 Participants were asked whether it was clear that IM was driving toward appropriate spacing.\\nController responses were variable but the majority (7/9; 78%) of controllers agreed for IM\\naircraft (M=62.9; SD=33.9) and all (8/8; 100%; missing=1) agreed for non-IM aircraft (M=89.8;\\nSD=12.0). Pilot responses were variable but the majority (15/18; 83%) of pilots agreed (M=76.5;\\nSD=27.9). Pilots were asked whether they trusted that the IM algorithm was providing the\\nappropriate speeds. Their responses were variable but the majority (15/17; 88%; missing=1)\\nagreed (M=73.4; SD=26.0). However, six pilots, regardless of whether they agreed or not,\\nreported some level of distrust. The observer noted several pilot comments indicating\\nconfusion about IM speeds. For example, if aircraft had a large amount of time to make up and\\ncould fly 250 kts, some pilots reported being confused about not receiving an IM speed of 250\\nkts. The reason for this could have been that the IM speed was limited (as described in Section\\n3.1.2) but still acceptable, or because the IM speed provided was the speed necessary,\\nregardless of speed limiting. The limiting was not annunciated to the flight crew. Figure 4-53\\ndepicts these results. Figure 4-53. Summary of Controller and Pilot Responses on IM Trust Statements 4-61 Pilots were asked whether they tried to out-guess the algorithm. Forty-seven percent (8/17;\\nmissing=1) provided yes responses (Figure 4-54). However, the majority (15/18; 83%) of pilots\\nreported they did not choose to ignore an IM speed (Figure 4-55). Figure 4-54. Pilot Responses to Did you ever try to out-guess the IM algorithm and the IM\\nspeeds? Figure 4-55. Pilot Responses to Did you choose not to fly an IM speed? 4-62 4.6.2 Workload\\nIn the post-scenario questionnaire, controllers and pilots were asked to rate their average\\noverall workload on the Bedford Workload Rating Scale. Table 4-41, Table 4-42, and Figure 4-56\\nshow the ratings for both controllers and pilots. As can be seen, controllers and pilots generally\\nfound workload to be acceptable. Table 4-41.

The pilot responses were variable (M=80.5; SD=26.2), but the\\nmajority (15/18; 83%) agreed. The majority (15/18; 83%) of the pilots also agreed they received\\nan acceptable number of IM speeds (M= 75.4; SD=24.9). However, at least four pilots,\\nregardless of whether they agreed or not, reported that the IM speeds could be too frequent at\\ntimes. Figure 4-57 depicts these results. Figure 4-57. Summary of Pilot Responses on Workload Statements 4-65 4.6.3 Controller Acceptability Rating Scale\\nIn the post-scenario questionnaire, controllers were asked to rate their acceptability of IM with\\nController Acceptance Rating Scale (Table 4-43 and Figure 4-58). As can be seen, controllers\\ngenerally found the system to be acceptable. Table 4-43.

Controller Response Means to Controller Acceptance Rating Scale 4-66 The following comments were captured in the questionnaires or were made to the observers.\\nThey are not directly tied to one question, but are included for completeness. The environment of terminal metering and IM during nominal conditions created a\\nrelatively low workload environment. Controllers sometimes mentioned worries about becoming monitors and being less\\nengaged in this environment. 4.7 Displays 4.7.1 Air Traffic Controllers\\nIn the post-scenario questionnaire, controllers were asked whether they had the necessary\\ndisplay elements to conduct IM. The results are shown in Table 4-44 and Figure 4-59.\\nControllers agreed, on average, regardless of role or tool set. Higher variability existed for both\\nfeeder and final replies, with the basic and the basic+ cue tool sets. As mentioned in Section 0,\\na statistical test was run on this measure and no statistically significant difference was found. Table 4-44.

Controller Responses to Post-Scenario Statement I had the necessary display\\nelements for conducting IM operations 4-68 In order to understand the impact of terminal metering elements on IM operations, controllers\\nwere asked whether the elements were helpful for IM and non-IM aircraft (Figure 4-60). The majority of controllers agreed for the following elements (some with higher variability): (Non-blue) Slot markers o Non-IM aircraft (6/9; 67%) (M= 79.8; SD= 22.7) Speed advisories o IM aircraft (6/9; 67%; missing n= 1) (M= 66.1; SD= 31.2) Note: Large variance driven by one 0 rating o Non-IM aircraft (6/9; 67%) (M = 69.1; SD= 25.4) Slot marker speeds o IM aircraft (8/9; 89%) (M= 76.9; SD= 28.0) o Non-IM aircraft (8/9; 89%) (M= 80.0; SD= 28.4) Aircraft indicated airspeed o IM aircraft (8/9; 89%) (M= 77.2; SD= 28.2) o Non-IM aircraft (8/9; 89%) (M= 78.4; SD= 28.3) Runway sequence number o IM aircraft (8/9; 89%) (M= 82.1; SD= 19.6) o Non-IM aircraft (8/9; 89%) (M= 82.0; SD= 19.6) Controller responses were variable for the following elements. (Non-blue) Slot Markers o IM Aircraft (M= 52.8; SD= 35.0) Early / Late indicator o IM aircraft (M= 35.9; SD= 34.1) o Non-IM aircraft (M= 30.2; SD= 24.9) Runway assignment o IM aircraft (M= 71.0; SD= 26.1) o Non-IM aircraft (M= 70.9; SD= 26.2) Timeline o IM aircraft (M= 40.7; SD= 38.9) o Non-IM aircraft (M= 34.1; SD= 36.4) 4-69 Figure 4-60. Controller Responses to The terminal metering elements were helpful for the IM and non-IM aircraft 4-70 The majority (7/9; 78%) of controllers agreed that the position of IM aircraft relative to the slot\\nmarkers was logical (M= 74.4; SD=24.6). The majority (7/9; 78%) of controllers also agreed that\\nthe behavior of the slot markers relative to IM aircraft was logical (M= 67.7; SD=25.6). Controllers were also asked about the new IM elements and if they were useful for IM. The\\nresults were: Trail aircraft status o The majority (8/9; 89%) of controllers agreed (M= 82.1; SD= 16.8) Lead aircraft status o The majority (8/9; 89%) of controllers agreed (M= 81.9; SD= 16.9) Blue slot marker o Controller responses were variable (M= 66.7; SD= 33.7) While the controllers were not asked about the ATPA features, it was noted by some that ATPA\\ndistance information covered the trail aircraft status information (e.g., T(A)) in the aircraft data\\nblock. This was reported as an issue. Controllers reportedly like the status information in the\\ndata block and did not want it to be removed near and on final. If this occurred and the\\ncontrollers did not have the blue slot markers for the run, the only way they knew the aircraft\\nwas doing IM was via the IM clearance window. Controllers were asked if the information in the IM clearance window was helpful for IM. The\\nmajority (7/9; 78%) of the controllers agreed for the IM status information (M=71.1; SD=30.8).\\nThe majority (7/9; 78%) of the controllers agreed for the projected spacing / ETA differential\\n(M=75.1; SD=21.2). The majority (8/9; 89%) of controllers also reported that it was helpful to be\\ninformed when there was no speed solution for IM (M=82.4; SD=17.9). Figure 4-61 depicts the\\nresults. 4-71 Figure 4-61. Summary of Controller Responses on IM Display Element Statements 4-72 When asked about the necessary monitoring of traffic, controller responses were variable but\\nthe majority of controllers (7/9; 78%) reported that the monitoring of IM traffic was increased\\n(M=3.2; SD=2.0) and the controller replies were variable for non-IM traffic (M=3.8; SD=1.9)\\n(Figure 4-62). When asked whether the necessary monitoring was acceptable, the majority\\n(8/9; 89%) of controllers agreed for IM aircraft (M=77.6; SD=17.4) and all controllers agreed for\\nnon-IM aircraft (M=85.2; SD=12.1) (Figure 4-63). Figure 4-62. Controller Responses to How did aircraft conducting IM during terminal\\nmetering effect your need to monitor traffic? Figure 4-63. Controller Responses to The necessary aircraft monitoring was acceptable 4-73 4.7.2 Flight Crew\\nThe pilots were asked about select, key min elements as well as the min+ IM elements. For the\\nmin elements, the majority (14/18; 78%) of pilots agreed the IM speed change advisory was\\nsufficient to detect the presence of a new speed (M=71.4; SD=23.5). All pilots agreed that the\\nIM speed conformance monitoring alert was useful (M=85.4; SD=8.6) and the majority (17/18;\\n94%) agreed that it is a minimum requirement (M=84.2; SD=18.4). Figure 4-64 depicts the\\nresults. Figure 4-64. Summary of Pilot Responses on Min Display Element Statements 4-74 For the min+ elements, the majority (14/18; 78%) of pilots reported that the graphical progress\\nindicator was",
