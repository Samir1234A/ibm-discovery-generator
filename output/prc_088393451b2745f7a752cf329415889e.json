My MITRE Journey: The Intern Edition (a Student Voices article for www.mitre.org) College is the time of your life where youre trying to figure out the great unknown. There's a lot of \\nuncertainty in your life, such as: Where is the 10-page paper I wrote last night? How did I go from 100 \\ndollars to 85 cents in a weekend? Most importantly, what is the next step in my life? College prepares you for the real world in many waysthrough academics, working with a diverse \\ngroup of people, learning time managementand it instills a sense of independence. You need to \\nexercise the knowledge gained in the classroom while seeking opportunities to learn off campus. Thats where internships come inits a chance to get professional experience in the field of your \\nchoosing. Gaining this experience is challenging for most, including me. Internships are highly \\ncompetitive these days, and they are increasingly hard to get as more students seek them out to build \\ntheir resumes. When I started applying for internships this spring, I found myself stuck. At 21 years old, most people \\ndont know what they want to do with their lives. Since many individuals in my generation are \\nattempting to continue their education, internships are more competitive and require a lot more just to \\nget into the maybe pile in the HR office. After receiving a few rejection letters, I came across a job posting for a Communication and Outreach \\nInternship position for MITRE. This post looked promising and aligned with my professional goals. With my track record, I didnt think anything would happen after I applied, but I was wrong. I received an \\ninterview and felt an immediate connection to the organizationthe kind you get when you know \\nsomething is meant to beall joy and zero doubt. I was righta week later I received an offer. Maryland, here I come! My Work Experience \\nI knew that the work I would be doing would be vital to the mission of the MITRE-operated National \\nCybersecurity FFRDC (NCF), which is located in Rockville, Maryland. The NCF is the nations first and only \\ncybersecurity federally funded research and development center. My job would support the National \\nCybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE)the NCFs principal work program sponsored by the \\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology. Among other things, the NCCoE staff produces practice \\nguides that organizations and industry can adapt to make the world safer against cyber-attacks. My first day at MITRE was one Ill never forget. The team welcomed me with open arms and support. \\nThey told me they couldnt wait for me to join them and were eager to see the things I could offer. Now call me crazy, but its every college students dream to hear something like that. In my interview, I \\nsaid I wanted my internship experience to be a real work experience. At that moment, I knew thats \\nexactly what I was going to get. I had many challenges along the way. For starters, I considered myself a good writer until I wrote my first \\ntechnical blog. I had no experience with that kind of writingtranslating information from a project into \\nsomething everyone could understand. (I imagined my grandmother as my target audience.) Then, my \\nnext assignmenta practice review guide reviewwas also very difficult. This experience helped me http://www.mitre.org\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/centers/national-cybersecurity-ffrdc/who-we-are\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/centers/national-cybersecurity-ffrdc/who-we-are\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/centers/national-cybersecurity-ffrdc/who-we-are\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/centers/national-cybersecurity-ffrdc/who-we-are\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/centers/we-operate-ffrdcs\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/centers/we-operate-ffrdcs\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/centers/we-operate-ffrdcs\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/centers/we-operate-ffrdcs\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/centers/we-operate-ffrdcs\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/centers/we-operate-ffrdcs\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/centers/we-operate-ffrdcs\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/centers/we-operate-ffrdcs\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/centers/we-operate-ffrdcs\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/centers/we-operate-ffrdcs\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/centers/we-operate-ffrdcs\\nhttps://www.nccoe.nist.gov/\\nhttps://www.nccoe.nist.gov/\\nhttps://www.nccoe.nist.gov/\\nhttps://www.nccoe.nist.gov/ 'Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 18-2764'. realize that there are more ways to discover problems in documents than I had ever imagined. I completed every challenging assignment I received, thanks in part to the mentors I had along the way. \\nThe team made sure that when I struggled, I had the resources and expertise I needed. My confidence \\ngrew because they believed I could handle any task that came my way. I had the opportunity to \\ncontribute to the same projects and tasks that the full-time professionals were working on. I wasnt a \\ncoffee jockey and was treated like an equal. The End of the Road \\nOverall, my experience as a MITRE intern leveled me above my peers. It was everything I could have \\nasked for and more. I would encourage other students to apply for a MITRE internship. I can say with \\nconfidence that the MITRE internship program is not only for science and engineering majorsits for \\nanyone looking for self-developmenta real-world professional experience. On top of all that, I formed friendships with other NCCoE interns and staff that I hope will continue when \\nI resume my studies in the fall. When people ask me what I did over the summer, I can say with \\nconfidence that I did my part to solve problems for a safer world. And that would be the truth. by Joshua Cobbins (Editors note: Joshua Cobbins is an undergraduate at McKendree University, in Lebanon, \\nIllinois. He is studying public relations.
