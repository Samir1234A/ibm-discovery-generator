  "text": "they \\nface when using mobile devices. Some companies who do attempt to address these risks struggle \\nto find relevant laws, standards, and guidelines that are easy to understand and implement. This \\nis further complicated by the fact that guidelines produced by government agencies across the \\nfederal and state levels are often inconsistent. For example, there is often confusion about what \\nsteps are mandatory and which actions are voluntary. In addition, some of the guidelines related \\nto cybersecurity that can be applied to mobile devices lead to stringent security controls that \\nexceed the level of security necessary for many enterprises, especially for SMEs. \\nMITREs assessment found that out of 47 security regulations, laws, standards, and guidelines, \\nthree are particularly relevant and useful for mobile device security: ASDs Information Security \\nManual, ASDs Essential Eight, and the OAICs Guide to Securing Personal Information. By \\nmapping the Practice Guide to those three documents, MITRE was able to identify strengths, \\nweaknesses, overlaps, and gaps. For example, our analysis found that the ISM mobile security \\ncontrols and the Essential Eight were the most relevant to Australian organizations in part due to \\nprocurement processes that reference these documents. \\nOur analysis also showed that the Practice Guide provided useful and practical guidelines on the \\nspecific issue of mobile device security within the Australian ecosystem. The Practice Guide \\nfinds a reasonable balance between security and user functionality, which works well for \\nAustralian organizations. \\nAt present, the Practice Guide can be a useful adjunct to the existing set of Australian guidelines \\nand could serve as a preeminent and comprehensive reference for organizations seeking to \\nimprove the cybersecurity of mobile devices. Furthermore, MITREs analyses and consultations \\nwith industry revealed that, with several modifications, the Practice Guide could become even \\nmore useful for SMEs: Simplify the Practice Guides technical language to make the report more accessible to a \\nwider audience, especially SMEs employing BYOD policies. Use infographics where \\nappropriate. Include mobile security best practices and concrete examples in the Practice Guide. Discuss the benefits and limitations of using cloud-based solutions that provide built-in \\nsecurity for SMEs relying on mobile devices for core business functions. \\n Include a deeper discussion of the touchpoints between security and privacy. For example, the Guide could provide more information on the risks and benefits of storing \\ndata on a mobile device versus saving it in a cloud. While the Practice Guide discusses \\nthe use of encryption for data in transit, it could tailor that discussion to address easy-to-\\nimplement approaches for SMEs. It could also include guidelines on encryption for data \\nat rest. \\n34 Organizations attempting to secure mobile devices must sift through a lengthy list of possible \\nlaws, regulations, standards, and guidelines to discern what steps they must take and what \\nactions are recommended as best practices. The Australian government can begin to address this \\nissue by harmonizing the guidelines it provides to industry. In this area, Australia could learn \\nfrom the United States experience in consolidating multiple competing government compliance \\nframeworks, most notably the Department of Defenses transition from the Defense Information \\nAssurance Certification and Accreditation Process to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. One \\nbenefit of using the Practice Guide is that it is based on that same framework, which is gaining \\nsignificant traction globally [29], including within Australia. \\nThis study only scratched the surface of this complex issue by mapping specific controls in three \\ndocuments to those in the Practice Guide. Further analyses of this type could yield important \\ninsights into the overlaps and gaps that organizations face in following the multiple cybersecurity \\nrequirements and guidelines emanating from government. \\nMITRE recommends that AustCyber, as a government-funded and industry-facing independent \\nentity, take the lead in facilitating intergovernmental and multistakeholder discussions on \\ncybersecurity standards harmonization with mobile device security serving as the initial use case \\nbecause of its broad applicability across both SMEs and larger enterprises. \\nA-1 Appendix A NIST Special Publication 1800-4 Security Control Map \\nThe table below is the original mapping of practice guide security characteristics to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, NIST Special \\nPublication 800-53 controls, ISO 27002 and the Council on Cybersecuritys Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense.
