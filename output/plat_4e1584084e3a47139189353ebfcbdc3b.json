Responses are shown for all \\nTRACON (NCT and non-NCT combined) and Tower Only. Response Means and Standard \\nDeviations are summarized in Table 5-47. Scale responses are shown in Figure 5-57. Table 5-47. Controller Responses to IM PA Alert Usefulness Participant Experience TRACON Tower\\nPredictive Alert Sample Size (n) 10 2 Mean (M) 80.2 93.0 Standard Deviation (SD) 24.4  Caution Alert lxxii\\n Sample Size (n) 10 2 Mean (M) 93.5 93.5 Standard Deviation (SD) 7.6  Figure 5-57. The IM PA Predictive Alert and IM PA Caution Alert were useful for the overall IM PA \\nmonitoring task. Note: o indicates NCT controller responses. The majority (90%) of TRACON controllers agreed the IM PA Predictive Alert was useful for the \\noverall IM PA monitoring task (M=80.2; SD=24.4). One controller disagreed and was the same \\ncontroller that noted in the previous question that they probably wouldnt take action until \\nrequired. All (100%) TRACON controllers agreed the IM PA Caution Alert was useful for the \\noverall IM PA monitoring task (M=93.5; SD=7.6). As described in Section 5.8.4, a one-tailed, paired sample T-Test found a significant difference in \\ncontroller agreement with respect to the usefulness of the two elements. Though both were \\nfound useful, stronger agreement was observed with the Caution Alert The higher average and lower variability of the Caution Alert suggests that controllers seem to \\nhave found it more useful than the Predictive Alert. Timeliness Assessment6.5.4.2\\nAt the end of each run (QT1), controllers were asked if the IM PA-related tools provided in this \\nscenario allowed for a timely detection of any impending exceedance of the WSL or CSL. Their \\nresponses were then examined with respect to IM PA Tool configuration. Response Means and \\nStandard Deviations are summarized in Table 5-48. Scale responses are shown in Figure 5-58. \\nOnly Week 2-3 TRACON controller responses were included in the analysis. This question only \\napplied to controllers responsible for 28R, so the Separate 28L Monitor position results are not \\nincluded. Table 5-48. IM PA Tool Notification Timeliness IM PA Tool Configuration lxxiii\\n Tools On Tools Off\\nCombined 28L/28R Monitor Sample Size (n) 7 7 Mean (M) 75.0 64.1 Standard Deviation (SD) 31.3 34.4 28R Monitor\\nSample Size (n) 7 7 Mean (M) 63.9 63.6 Standard Deviation (SD) 33.1 32.1 Figure 5-58. The IM PA-related tools provided in this scenario allowed for a timely detection of any \\nimpending exceedance of the WSL or CSL. Note: o indicates Week 1 TRACON controller responses for reference. These are not included in the M and SD computations. Week 2-3 TRACON controller responses were variable for each IM PA Tools and monitor \\nconfiguration. However, the majority (86%) of TRACON controllers in the Combined Monitor \\nconfiguration agreed the IM PA Tools allowed for a timely detection of an impending \\nexceedance when On (M=75.0; SD=31.3). A majority (71%) also agreed when Off (M=64.1; \\nSD=34.4). For the Separate 28R Monitor position, a majority (57%) agreed when On (M=33.1; \\nSD=33.1) and Off (M=63.6; SD=32.1). Though the mean was higher, and the variability was lower for the IM PA Tools On in the \\nCombined 28L/28R Monitor configuration, the high variability across all of the conditions \\nsuggest none were actually more or less effective to the Week 2-3 TRACON controllers than any \\nof the others. --------------------------------- A similar question was asked at the end of each run (QT1) to participants working as the 28R \\nFinal controller: The IM PA-related tools provided in this scenario allowed for a timely \\ndetection of any spacing or separation issues. TRACON controller responses were also then lxxiv\\n examined with respect to IM PA Tool configuration. Response Means and Standard Deviations \\nfor the 28R Final controller position are summarized in Table 5-49. Scale responses are shown in \\nFigure 5-59. Only TRACON controller responses were included in the analysis. Table 5-49. 28R Final Controller: IM PA Tools Allowed for Timely Issue Detection IM PA Tool Configuration Tools On Tools Off\\nSample Size (n) 10 10 Mean (M) 70.7 65.6 Standard Deviation (SD) 33.2 30.4 Figure 5-59. 28R Final Controller: The IM PA-related tools provided in this scenario allowed for a timely \\ndetection of any spacing or separation issues. Note: o indicates NCT controller responses. TRACON controller responses were variable, but the majority (70%) agreed with IM PA Tools On \\n(M=70.7; SD=33.2) and the majority (60%) agreed with IM PA Tools Off (M=65.6; SD=30.4). \\nComments from controllers who disagreed were related to not having prior knowledge of the \\nsafety limit proximity before issuing the clearance and not knowing the WSL sooner. No \\npractical difference was observed between the two IM PA Tool configurations. --------------------------------- As described in Sections 4.5.4 and 4.5.6.5, a portion of the evaluation on Day 3 involved \\nmanipulating the Timing values for the Predictive and Caution Alerts to determine if \\nreducing the alerting time would be more or less acceptable in the separation \\nmonitoring task. The timing values used in the HITL are shown in Table 4-12. Due to a \\nWeek 1 Alert Timing scenario issue, only the Week 2-3 TRACON controller responses are \\nincluded in the analysis. In the Alert Timing Post-Run Questionnaires (QT4), controllers were asked if: The Predictive (yellow) alert provided sufficient advance notice of an impending \\nCaution Alert. \\nThe Caution (orange) alert provided sufficient advance notice of an impending loss of \\nseparation. lxxv\\n Responses are shown for all TRACON (NCT and non-NCT combined) for each Alert Timing value. \\nResponse Means and Standard Deviations are summarized in Table 5-50. Scale responses are \\nshown in Figure 5-60. Table 5-50. Controller Responses to Sufficiently of Alert Timing Advance Notice Alert Timing (Predictive / Caution) 45 / 24 sec 35 / 20 sec 25 / 15 sec\\nPredictive Alert Sample Size (n) 7 7 7 Mean (M) 68.0 78.3 62.7 Standard Deviation (SD) 37.4 33.4 33.7 Caution Alert\\nSample Size (n) 7 7 7 Mean (M) 74.3 79.1 69.3 Standard Deviation (SD) 34.6 33.0 37.5 Figure 5-60. The IM PA [Predictive / Caution] Alert provided sufficient advance notice of an impending \\n[Caution Alert / loss of separation]. Note: o indicates Week 2-3 Tower controller responses for reference. These are not included in the M and SD computations. Week 2-3 TRACON controller responses were variable for each type of alert and timing value. \\nThe majority (71%) of TRACON controllers agreed for the Predictive Alert with the 45/24 and \\n25/15 values. The majority (86%) of TRACON controllers agreed for 35/20 value. For the Caution \\nAlert, the majority (86%) agreed for the 45/24 and 35/20 values and the majority (71%) agreed \\nfor the 25/15 value. Though the means were relatively higher for the 35/20 value for both alert types, the high \\nvariability across all of the Alert Timing scenarios suggests that none of the timings were lxxvi\\n actually more or less acceptable to the Week 2-3 TRACON controllers than any of the others. --------------------------------- In the Alert Timing Post-Run Questionnaires (QT4), controllers were also asked if: I could easily assess whether the IM Trail aircraft would remain behind the CSL during \\nthe approach. \\nI could easily assess whether the IM Trail aircraft would remain forward of the WSL \\nduring the approach (when applicable). Responses are shown for all TRACON (NCT and non-NCT combined) for each alert timing value. \\nResponse Means and Standard Deviations are summarized in Table 5-51. Scale responses are \\nshown in Figure 5-61. Table 5-51.

I could easily assess whether the IM PA trail aircraft would remain [behind the CSL / \\nforward of the WSL] during the approach. Note: o indicates Week 2-3 Tower controller responses for reference. These are not included in the M and SD computations. lxxvii\\n All Week 2-3 TRACON controllers agreed they could easily assess whether the IM PA Trail \\nAircraft would remain behind the CSL during the approach for the 45/24 value (M=92.3; SD=9.1) \\nand the 35/20 value (M=90.9; SD=8.7). All also agreed they could easily assess whether the IM \\nPA Trail Aircraft would remain forward of the WSL during the approach for the 35/20 value \\n(M=85.6.9; SD=17.2). Week 2-3 TRACON controller responses were variable for the 25/15 alert timing values for each \\nsafety limit, but a majority (71%) agreed for the CSL (M=71.1; SD=34.3) and WSL (M=71.0; \\nSD=35.0). Responses were also variable for the 45/24 value for the WSL, but a majority (86%) \\nalso agreed (M=76.6; SD=34.4).",
