  "text": "Phase6.3.2\\nRecommendations for mitigations within the Technology Maturity and Risk Reduction phase are \\nlike those in the Materiel Solutions Analysis phase. However, there is more specificity in this \\nphase. The defenders are more focused on solutions and the adversaries may have made some \\nchoices about what technology to investigate further. For these reasons, the Deception technique \\nis added to the recommended techniques to consider. There are three approaches Obfuscation, \\nDissimulation/Disinformation and Misdirection that are included within the Deception \\ntechnique that are applicable to the Technology Maturity and Risk Reduction phase. Obfuscation \\n(i.e., encryption) makes it difficult for the adversary to identify and target high value information \\nresources. Dissimulation/disinformation purposely provides the adversary with false information \\nso that attacks developed for later phases are ineffective. Misdirection wastes the adversary \\nresources by directing them to deception environments (i.e., honeynets). Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase6.3.3\\nDuring the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase the initial exploit may occur. \\nThe adversary goals expand to developing and delivering this exploit, initiating it and then \\ncontrolling the subsequent attack. With a more active adversary, the defenders can gain \\ninformation about the adversary in addition to reducing and limiting the attacks that reach the \\nOperations and Support phase. In addition to the Deception technique, the Analytic Monitoring \\ntechnique can be effective in gathering information to share with later phases of the acquisition \\nlifecycle. Both Substantiated Integrity and Non-Persistence techniques can make it difficult for \\nthe adversary to deliver an exploit, hopefully reducing the number of attacks. Substantiated \\nIntegrity provides mechanisms for checking whether resources such as critical services, \\ninformation stores, information streams and components have been corrupted. Non-Persistence \\nprovides opportunities to refresh those critical resources from known good sources. The Non-\\nPersistence technique also reduces the time resources are available to be attacked. When these \\ntwo techniques are combined with the Unpredictability technique, the adversarys ability to \\ncreate accurate and precise plans decreases, thus reducing the number of attacks that later appear \\nin the Operations and Support phase of the Acquisition Lifecycle. \\nSensor Fusion and Analysis is an approach within Analytic Monitoring that helps expose \\nadversary activity. Defenders use monitoring data and preliminary analysis results from various \\ncomponents and integrates this information with external threat intelligence to identify potential \\nor actual adversary activity. The Malware and Forensic Analysis approach to Analytic \\nMonitoring focuses on known adversary activities and artifacts to identify the presence and \\nactivities of the adversary. Both approaches provide information that can be used to eliminate \\nthe initial exploit and follow-on control exerted by the adversary. The information gained using \\nthis technique can also be shared with later acquisition lifecycle phases and make it easier for the \\ndefender to make effective recovery plans. xxx The Non-Persistence approaches described above can be used in the Engineering and \\nManufacturing Development phase to reduce the adversarys ability to deliver, initiate and \\ncontrol attacks by reducing the paths into the environment through the Non-Persistent Services \\nand Non-Persistent Connectivity approaches. The Non-Persistent Information approach can be \\nimplemented by reimaging the environment from known clean images.\\nThe Substantiate Integrity technique approaches Integrity Quality Checks, Provenance \\nChecking, and Behavioral Validation are all useful in ensuring that the clean images \\nreferenced in the previous paragraph are indeed clean and reimaging the environment with these \\nimages will not cause the adversary to persist.\\nAs previously described, the approaches within the Unpredictability technique can be used to \\nincrease the effectiveness of other approaches. Within the Engineering and Manufacturing \\nDevelopment phase, defenders can combine Temporal Unpredictability with the Non-Persistence \\napproaches to increase the uncertainty for the adversary. For example, the adversary will have a \\nmuch more difficult time executing successful attacks and remaining undiscovered if they are \\nuncertain about how long a service will be available, a connection will stay open or their exploit \\nwill remain in the environment. Likewise, combining Contextual Unpredictability with integrity \\nquality checks makes it more difficult for the adversary to emulate components and get \\ncompromised components into fielded systems. Production and Deployment Phase6.3.4\\nThe Production and Deployment Phase is an attractive target for the adversary because this phase \\nhas the most mature products prior to the Operations and Support phase but the safeguards that \\nare in the Operations & Support phase may not be in place in this environment. If the defenders \\n the prime contractors and subcontractors are using cyber resiliency techniques such as \\nAnalytic Monitoring, Deception, and Dynamic Representation, there is a high likelihood that they \\nwill be able to identify and understand adversary behavior. Even if they are unable to completely \\nstop the adversary activity, they will be able to gather information and share it with the \\nOperations & Support phase environments so that they are better able to limit the impact of the \\nattacks there. In addition, it may be easier to stop or limit the attacks in the Production and \\nDeployment phase with techniques such as Adaptive Response because there may be more \\nflexibility in this phase than in the operational environment. Likewise, some aspects of \\nCoordinated Defense and Diversity techniques may be easier prior to the operational \\nenvironment. \\nThe approaches within the Dynamic Representation technique Dynamic Mapping & Profiling, \\nDynamic Threat Modeling, and Mission Dependency & Status Visualization are focused on \\nconstructing and maintaining representations of the environment or mission in light of cyber \\nevents and actions (both adversarial and defense). The Dynamic Mapping & Profiling approach \\nidentifies software and components that do not conform to policy requirements or that are \\nbehaving in unexpected ways. The Dynamic Threat Modeling approach reveals patterns and \\ntrends in adversary behavior and the Mission Dependency & Status Visualization approach \\nidentifies consequences of adversary execution. The information gained from these approaches \\ncan be combined with the other information used in Analytic Monitoring along with information \\ngained from Deception activities to increase the likelihood of identifying and understanding \\nadversary behavior and targeting for this Acquisition Lifecycle phase as well as Operations and \\nSupport. With this information, recovery plans for the Operations and Support phase can be \\ndefined and tested. xxxi Operations and Support Phase6.3.5\\nOnce the Acquisition Lifecycle has moved into the Operations and Support phase, there is \\nfrequently less flexibility in what mitigations can be employed as well as limits on what the \\nmitigations can do. The malware will already have been implemented in the targeted mission \\nsystem so it is harder to preclude an attack in this phase. For example, because the environment \\nmay not be flexible, the ability to deploy Adaptive Response mitigations is limited. Similarly, \\nmany of the deployed solutions may need to be very lean, this reduces the opportunity for \\nAnalytic Monitoring, Dynamic Representation and Redundancy. While the cyber resiliency \\ntechniques mentioned here will be useful, in these cases, they will primarily be leveraging what is \\nalready in the environment and so are not optimized for the defender goals of reducing and \\neliminating attacks and gaining and sharing information about those attacks. Note that the \\nenvironment being defended is now the mission system\\nThe approaches within the Adaptive Response technique Dynamic Reconfiguration, Dynamic \\nResource Allocation and Adaptive Management are focused on nimbly implementing courses of \\naction to manage risk. These approaches can most effectively be leveraged in the Operations and \\nSupport phase if they have been designed into the environment and used with the Technical \\nDefense-in-Depth approach of the Coordinated Defense technique. The combined techniques \\nprovide the defenders with the ability to adaptively respond to attacks this enables the defenders \\nto recover from attacks more effectively and faster than would otherwise be possible. The use of \\nthese approaches depends on the flexibility of the operational environment and so these \\napproaches are not usually successful unless planning for them has started early in the design. Method for Applying Cyber Resiliency Mitigations and Worked 6.4\\nExample Cyber resiliency enables the operational mission and supporting systems to better anticipate, \\nwithstand, recover, and evolve despite adversary attacks and other adverse effects. Thus, when \\napplying supply chain cyber resiliency mitigations to a mission system acquisition, the \\nmitigations ought to be contextualized by, and support, the operational mission. The most \\neffective way for a mission system to achieve maximal cyber resiliency is to start with the to-\\nbe operational system and work backwards through the acquisitions lifecycle. For each \\nacquisitions phase, these are the appropriate questions that should be asked: Which supply chain threats pose the largest mission risk?\\nInstead of focusing solely on the mission criticality of assets, we want to apply a broader \\napproach that acknowledges that an adversary is likely to exploit the easiest attack vectors \\nto achieve their objective. To do this we want to identify which threats pose the most risk \\nto the mission those threats that are the most likely and may cause the most harm to the \\noverall mission. How might the mission system be improved to mitigate the most damaging supply \\nchain attacks or compromises?\\nIf some of the supply chain attacks will be successful, we want to assure the mission \\nsystem and the supply chain against those that pose the largest risk. How might we improve the recovery & evolution of the system against future supply",
