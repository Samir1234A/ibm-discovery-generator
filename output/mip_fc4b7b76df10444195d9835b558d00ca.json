  "text": "cost and sustainment cost drivers. \\nThis section needs to be integrated into the Life Cycle Cost data records. The tables with program cost become obsolete within weeks or months of the LCSP being signed. The LCSP section should only include inputs that are leveraged by the other cost sections of the data base as numerical factor inputs, such as the fixed and variable operating cost of the depot or repair facility, as a part of the component breakdown data. Some sample data (371a 371h). m) Section 8 requires information about the program office and its organization. This data is \\nnot needed here, as it is already contained in the AP sections of the data base, as well as organizational records of the PEO. The name of the product support manager and Program Manager are in the front part of the E-LCSP data record. n) Section 9.1 requires design interface information. This data should be incorporated into \\nthe component breakdown data series, as separate columns to indicate the effect and criticality of a failed interface. [[Added data 391-393 in component breakdown]]. o) Section 9.1.1 requires duplication of data from the SEP. This is not needed, as the SEP \\ndata should be captured in a separate section and not duplicated. When data reports are created as views of the data the different data sections can be integrated together as needed. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.

Public Release Case Number 18-2212 Digital Acquisition for FASTLane r10f.pdf D a ve L e c h n e r, Th e M I TR E C o r p o r a t i o n R 1 0 , O c t o b e r 1 , 2 0 1 8 Digital Acquisition Data Base \\nfor Defense Acquisition Programs Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212 This technical data deliverable was developed using contract funds under Basic Contract No. W56KGU-18-D-0004. Sponsor: Naval Surface Warfare Center, Office of the Chief Technologist Officer MITRE Dept. No.: P631 Contract No.: W56KGU-17-C-0010 Project No.: 0718V190-RT | 2 | 'Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' BLUF Objective for Today: Review Digital Acquisition data schema and proposed tools developed by MITRE under FASTLane initiative. Obtain leadership feedback and concurrence to start use via pilot program. Proposed approach shifts most acquisition documents from piles of paper and pdf files to a data base. COTS Software approach allows rapid use in pilot programs. Using digital acquisition should allow faster program creation, improved planning, and better oversight. | 3 | 'Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' Introduction Early FY17, MITRE was supporting DASD/DT Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' Background: Per Ms. Ellen Lord, Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, at the DAU Training Symposium (April 3, 2018) Program Managers need to bring data to decisions. What data and metrics do we have  what does the data/trends tell us? Opinions are interesting, but irrelevant. Need good data engineers/analysts. SCO, DIUx, JIDO, and other organizations popped up because 5000.02 didnt do what we needed it to do In 2017 the Deputy assistant Secretary of the Navy (DASN) for RDT Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' Converted the AP Appendix into Project Specific Data Base Schema RTI AP: Data centric Approximately 100 pieces of information. Mix of text, dates, numbers, and yes/no values. | 6 | 'Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' E-AP (RTI) Ported to Sharepoint No real program data yet. Used MITRE Partnership Web Site. Navy site in-process. | 7 | 'Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' Motivation for Data Base Use: Accumulate the acquisition data associated with Navy programs. Enables the use of automated workflow based tools to route \\napprovals, track activity and accumulate metrics, ( allowing \\ninsight into how long these documents take for approval). Enables backward looking data analytics analysis can \\ndetermine traits of successful programs. Could provide data to help answer questions such as: \\n What do successful programs have in common? What do unsuccessful projects have in common? Allow data-driven answers using statistical correlation \\ntechniques to make strategic policy decisions Allows much faster program creation and \\napproval and improves program oversight and management. | 8 | 'Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' To Improve Planning or Oversight We Needed to Add Some Data Started out with basic AP data. Added data to provide more useful information and improve decision making. What questions would PMs and PEOs ask in an AP review? How does the program compare to other similar programs that succeeded or failed? Have similar programs been protested or awarded without discussions? (add award success) Have similar programs experienced cost over-runs? (add CPI after award) How has this PMO done on their last few programs? How are the programs in this PEOs portfolio executing? What is the experience level of the PMO team? Data schema will evolve based on use Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' Then: Created an Electronic Acquisition Strategy (E-AS) Schema Only needed for new programs of record, per DoD 5000 Somewhat larger 240 pieces of information (initial data set). Two repeating sub-tables of data, for 1) Policy Waivers and 2) RF Signatures. Used 100 series data codes. (we need a unique data code for each item). 99 Text Fields: Less useful data, but retains familiarity Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' Electronic T Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' Created Data Schema for Several Other Acquisition Documents Cyber Security Strategy completed Cyber Security Program Plan In \\nprocess Life Cycle Sustainment Plan \\ncompleted Acquisition Decision Memorandum \\ncompleted. APB - In process NAVSEA TEMPALTS FLEX Data \\nPackage completed. RTI Source Selection Plan \\ncompleted. 40+ More DoD 5000.02 Documents\\n 35+ Seem applicable to data base conversion. An initial pilot assessment is possible \\nwith current list. | 12 | 'Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' Web Tools Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' Longer Term, When we have data Potential Expert Wizard (aka Turbo-Tax) For Project Planning: Could provide comparison data based on current timespans for approval schedule data, allow default. Could recommend data based on project data, goals, and objective timelines. Could allow engineer or PM to pick similar to projects to see their data and make informed decisions. For Program Management and Reviews: Could allow PEO or PM to compare the project to others in a similar manner as the planning module, and compare execution schedules and success. Could provide email alerts for an ongoing project, when an execution parameter passes a certain threshold or misses a critical milestone in a manner that predicts future problems.

Illustrative Graphics Not real data. | 16 | 'Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' Preliminary Comparative LOE Model Model assumes medium sized program of record efforts. Tracks meta-time, not associated with contractor efforts. 16 month to initiate Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' Near Term Work, FY19, Low LOE Clean up data base ensure uniform approach. Test iNAVSEA and InFusion tools Ensure forms work, pass data, and provide Assess DoD server options. Assess data privileges and PMO/data security. Who can see what data Create workflow Test project review and approval tool with users. Simulate a document review and approval. Test project planning tools with users. Refine dashboards in consultation with SYSCOM/PEO leadership. Develop training package (online) for each user type. Several months of engineering still required prior to use on pilot projects. Currently only low LOE effort is funded. | 18 | 'Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' Implementation Options Three options to implement pilot programs\\n Low LOE: FASTLane only. A few programs, a few documents (funded FY19) Mid 1 SYSCOM, Multiple documents. More user testing and user support. Larger LOE: 4 SYSCOMs over 2 years. Start with 1 PEO, then 1 SYSCOM, then add a \\nSYSCOM each quarter. Add more documents as data modules each month. Existing Navy software infrastructure is adequate for a pilot \\nprogram. If successful, PMOs could eventually convert old data currently \\ncaptured in legacy paper plans. Completed Socialization with NAVSEA, NAVAIR, & SPWAR. Full support so far from all 3 of these SYSCOMs MARCORPS SYSCOM",
