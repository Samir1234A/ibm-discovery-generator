Your identity will be kept confidential and \\nwill not be included in any of the material that will be produced as a result of this study. How many years of experience do you have actively controlling air traffic? Years1. How many months out of the past 12 have you actively controlled air traffic? Months2. Age: Years 3. At which facility do you now (or did you last) work? 4. What is your current (or most recent) position? 5. Have you ever worked at a final approach monitor position? (circle one) YES NO6. If yes, approximately how many months / years? If yes, which facility / facilities? If yes, did you monitor parallel runway arrivals? YES NO If yes, were they dependent, independent, or both? DEPENDENT INDEPENDENT BOTH Have you ever worked at a final approach control position? (circle one) YES NO7. If yes, approximately how many months / years? If yes, which facility? If yes, did you control during parallel runway arrivals? YES NO If yes, were they dependent, independent, or both? DEPENDENT INDEPENDENT BOTH What other positions have you held within the FAA (e.g., TMC, airspace operations, etc.)? 8.\\n \\n (see next page) ii\\n Have you ever been a controller at Northern California TRACON (NCT)? (circle one) YES NO9. If yes, which sectors and approximately how many months / years in each: \\n \\n Have you ever been a controller at the San Francisco International Airport (SFO) air traffic control 10.\\ntower? (circle one) YES NO If yes, which position(s) and approximately how many months / years: Have you ever worked at a facility that conducted closely spaced parallel approaches? (circle one) 11.\\nYES NO If yes, which facility and position(s): Do you have any experience (such as demos or simulations) with concepts like Interval Management 12.\\nand/or Paired Approach? (circle one) YES NO If yes, please describe your previous experience:\\n \\n \\n \\n i\\n Day 1-2 Post-Run QuestionnairesAppendix C IM PA HITL POST-RUN QUESTIONNAIRE COMBINED MONITOR Instructions: Please answer the questions by drawing a vertical line through the option on each \\nof the scales at the point which matched your experience (as shown below) or circling an option \\n(e.g., yes / no). Please draw your line like this:Good PoorNOT like this: Good Poor When choosing an option, keep in mind that the general monitoring task for an IM PA operation \\nis the primary area of interest. Although the simulation used certain elements of the SFO \\nairspace, your answer should be more of a general consideration of the PA monitoring task, \\ninstead of how it might specifically be applied to the SFO environment. Please consider only the current scenario when answering. If you have any questions, please \\nask the experimenter. ii\\n Workload Using the chart below, how would you rate your average level of workload in this 1.\\nscenario? (a) Working up from the bottom left corner, answer each yes/no question and \\nfollow the path. (b) Circle the numerical rating that best reflects your experience. My workload in this scenario was acceptable. (draw a line on the scale)2. Comments: \\n \\n iii\\n Operations As the IM PA aircraft pairs became my responsibility, I had sufficient time to make a 3.\\nfirst assessment of their separation. (draw a line on the scale) Comments: \\n \\n I was comfortable with the IM PA trail aircraft managing their speeds to achieve the 4.\\nspacing goal assigned by the final controller. (draw a line on the scale) Comments: \\n \\n I was confident that I could assess whether separation would be maintained 5.\\nbetween the IM PA trail aircraft and their Lead Aircraft. (draw a line on the scale) Comments: \\n \\n iv\\n Did you need to terminate an IM PA operation during this scenario? (circle one)6. Yes No If yes, why? \\n \\n Given the IM PA-related tools I had in this scenario, I had sufficient overall traffic 7.\\nsituation awareness. (draw a line on the scale) Comments: \\n \\n Given the appropriate training and the IM PA-related tools provided in this scenario, 8.\\na single monitor controller can effectively ensure separation across both approaches \\nduring IM PA operations. (draw a line on the scale) Comments: \\n \\n Displays With the IM PA-related tools provided in this scenario, I could easily assess the 9.\\nseparation between the IM PA trail aircraft and its lead, when they were my \\nresponsibility. (draw a line on the scale) Comments: \\n \\n v\\n With the IM PA-related tools provided in this scenario, I could easily assess the 10.\\nseparation among all aircraft for which I was responsible. (draw a line on the scale) Comments: \\n \\n I could easily assess whether the IM PA trail aircraft would remain behind the CSL 11.\\nduring the approach. (draw a line on the scale) Comments: \\n \\n I could easily assess whether the IM PA trail aircraft would remain forward of the 12.\\nWSL during the approach, when applicable. (draw a line on the scale) Comments: \\n \\n I could easily assess whether the lead and trail aircraft would remain within their 13.\\nlateral maneuvering bounds during the approach. (draw a line on the scale) Comments: \\n \\n vi\\n The IM PA-related tools provided in this scenario allowed for a timely detection of 14.\\nany impending exceedance of the WSL or CSL. (draw a line on the scale) Comments: \\n \\n The IM PA-related tools provided in this scenario allowed for a timely detection of 15.\\nany excessive deviation from the approach course by aircraft involved in a PA \\noperation. (draw a line on the scale) Comments: \\n \\n Given the IM PA-related tools provided in this scenario, I could easily tell when an 16.\\naircraft would require a WSL later in the approach. (draw a line on the scale) Comments: \\n \\n Given the IM PA-related tools provided in this scenario, I was comfortable 17.\\nmonitoring IM PA operations when both a CSL and WSL were active at the same \\ntime. (draw a line on the scale) Comments: \\n \\n vii\\n Was all of the provided IM PA information in this scenario useful, including that in 18.\\nboth the Spacing List and data blocks? (circle one)",
