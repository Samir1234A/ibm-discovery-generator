  "text": "on the IM algorithm design. Slot markers, speed advisories, and the timelines\\nwere reported as less useful for IM operations. CA-4 examined the pre-conditioning of traffic, different controller tool sets, and IM integration,\\namong other things (Callantine et al., 2013). There were eight IM aircraft per run in a demand\\nof around 43 aircraft per runway per hour (for a fifteen-minute run). The IM status designators\\nin the data block were also updated. Center and TRACON controllers were participants. Authors\\nreported having some data confounding issues due to winds and system behaviors that\\nnegatively affected IM operations (leading to numerous suspensions) and the ability to measure 2-17 final approach spacing accuracy for IM. However, center controllers found the IM clearance\\nacceptable (in contrast to CA-3), and reported a desire to split the communication into two\\nparts. IM was reported by controllers, on average, to increase task complexity without doing so\\nexcessively. The TSS-2 simulation mainly examined issues related to TSAS operations (Wynnyk and Kopald,\\n2013). Four TRACON controllers participated. There were three IM aircraft per run in a demand\\nof around 45 aircraft per runway per hour (for a half hour run). Controllers were told IM was\\nnot a key part of the simulation, and very little IM-related data was reported. However, from\\nthe results that were provided, the TRACON controllers average rating was neutral for\\nusefulness of the TSAS tools for IM. However, average rating for other tasks such as managing\\ntraffic and managing the schedule received a similar rating. The majority of controllers reported\\nthat the IM designator (indicator of the status of the IM operation) was an important part of a\\ncustom toolset. The CA-5.3 simulation examined how TSAS can improve efficiency of arrival operations during\\nhigh demand (Callantine et al., 2014). Center and TRACON controllers were participants.\\nThough the authors did not report specific IM-related result, they did mention that maintaining\\ninter-arrival spacing without IM was an issue and required further examination. Finally, the IMAC simulation mainly examined acceptability and system performance of\\ndifferent IM operations (Baxley et al., 2016). Eight Center and TRACON controllers were\\nparticipants (pilots were also participants). Overall, controllers rated the concept, workload,\\nand displays acceptable. The Controller Acceptance Rating Scale ratings also indicated\\nacceptability. The authors recommended a feasibility check prior to initiating IM and during IM\\nconduct so the controller knows when the ASG is invalid. 2.4.2.3 MITRE Concept Evaluation Activities\\nThree concept evaluations were conducted by MITRE in 2016 to explore IM and TSAS\\nintegration issues in the MITRE Integration Demonstration and Experimentation for Aeronautics\\n(IDEA) lab using a team of FAA ground system, flight deck, and ATC domain experts. The goal\\nwas to seek input from experts on the integration of the TSAS and IM operations, the prototype\\ndisplays, and plans for a follow-on HITL simulation (this activity) in all the capabilities being\\nutilized. Each evaluation was a step in the development process as the lab capability matured.\\nImprovements were made over the course of the evaluations as the lab implementation\\nmatured and as input was received. Over the course of the three evaluations, sample changes\\nand improvements included: increased traffic density, the reposition of an ABP to the merge of\\ntwo flows, updated IM information on the STARS display, and the addition of RNP RF turns.\\nThese and other relevant changes will be discussed in subsequent sections. Overall, the\\nparticipants found the operations to have potential to work together, but had questions that\\nwould need to be addressed in the HITL simulation. 2-18 2.5 Study Purpose and Design 2.5.1 ATC Topics\\nThe understanding of an operation and the information displayed to the controller is key to the\\nsuccessful implementation of an operation. Fundamental to the ATC task is keeping cognizant\\nof current and evolving conditions, i.e., maintaining situation awareness. When aircraft are\\nconducting IM, controllers monitor aircraft speed control instead of actively directing it.\\nPrevious studies have indicated that monitoring of aircraft under flight deck spacing operations\\nwas increased for non-spacing aircraft in a spacing stream (Mercer et al., 2005), but reduced for\\naircraft that had been sequenced and were maintaining their spacing (Aligne et al., 2003).\\nRegardless of the impact on monitoring, there did not appear to be an effect on safety or a loss\\nof situation awareness. A summary report of several European IM simulations (Hebraud,\\nMartin, Leone, and Troise, 2006) reported on a study of Italian airspace that found improved\\ncontroller situation awareness when using IM during metering operations, which also led to\\nimproved coordination between controllers. Related to situation awareness is the controllers trust in the IM operation. They must fully\\nunderstand the objectives and methods IM uses to achieve and maintain spacing and they must\\nbe able to trust that flight crews will properly follow the IM speeds. The degree to which their\\nmental models conform to the reality of IM operations allow them to appropriately calibrate\\ntheir level of trust as conditions change. For example, if IM usually proceeds in a predictable\\nfashion, but one aircraft starts deviating from the expected procedures, controllers will more\\nlikely be able to detect the situation and intervene before it escalates. Mercer, et al. (2005)\\nfound that predictability is important for controller acceptance. During IM operations,\\ncontrollers will need to know what spacing to expect at key points and that the flight crews will\\noperate their aircraft in predictable ways. Over-trust, resulting in a loss of situation awareness, can also be an issue. If controllers\\ncompletely trust an operation, they can become complacent and not perform their normal,\\nnecessary checks on the traffic. This can result in controllers taking longer to detect a\\ndeveloping situation. Therefore, ways to minimize controller over-trust must be considered by\\nconcept developers. Past work has generally found IM can work in a metering environment with limited issues (e.g.,\\nRognin et al., 2005; Benson et al., 2011; Baxley et al., 2016). However, some key topics remain\\nopen. The remainder of this section will review the relevant work related to the open topics. 2.5.1.1 IM Operations Relative to TSAS Slot Markers\\nIn Cabrall et al. (2012), TRACON controllers reported favorably on IM overall and they reported\\nthat the slot markers were helpful and usable for IM operations. However, feeder controllers\\nreported the slot markers were very similar in helpfulness but less usable for IM aircraft as\\ncompared to non-IM aircraft. They reported confusion regarding IM spacing behavior relative\\nto the slot markers and therefore, the underlying schedule. The controllers expected to have IM\\naircraft also in the slot markers and were uncomfortable when the IM aircraft were not in the\\nslot markers. Controllers also appeared to be unsure of IM aircraft behavior relative to the slot 2-19 markers. They reported problems with IM aircraft arriving early relative to the schedule. The\\nauthors indicated that follow-on work would look at enhancements to the slot markers to\\nprovide controllers information on IM operation progress. However, it was not seen in the\\nsubsequent reports. In the follow-on simulation, Callantine et al. (2012) reported scenarios where the slot markers\\nwere removed when aircraft were conducting IM. However, no results were reported. In the\\nthird of the series of these simulations, while it is not explicitly stated, a figure seems to\\nindicate that the slot markers were used for IM aircraft in the TRACON (Callantine et al., 2012).\\nTRACON controllers again reported slot markers as being helpful and they reported being\\nconfident in their use. However, the reported results did not differentiate between slot marker\\nuse for IM and non-IM operations, so it is unclear whether the issue discussed in Cabrall et al.\\n(2012) is still applicable. In the conclusion, the authors point out that the TRACON tool use\\nduring IM operations requires controller acceptance as well as consistent understanding and\\nuse. When summarizing this third simulation, Callantine et al. (2013) noted that controllers had\\nsome misunderstanding of IM aircraft behavior. In another ATD-1 simulation, Thipphavong et al., (2013) reported that IM trail aircraft had\\nworse schedule conformance at the terminal meter points (indicating slot marker deviations)\\nbut better at the FAF, as compared to aircraft not performing IM. TRACON controllers reported\\nthat they saw short-term, but less long-term, mismatches between the IM aircraft position and\\nthe slot marker position. As the authors note, this is to be expected based on IM algorithm\\nbehavior. Finally, controllers reported that the slot markers were less useful for IM aircraft than\\nfor non-IM aircraft. As mentioned previously, after most ATD-1 activities, MITRE concept evaluations were\\nconducted in preparation for the HITL simulation reported here. The participants in the concept\\nevaluations also determined that IM spacing behavior and deviation from slot markers should\\ncontinue to be examined in the concept evaluations, followed by the HITL simulation. Some\\noptions were tested during the concept evaluations that led to the final simulation\\nimplementation that will be reviewed in Section 3.1.3.3. One option that was tested at the third\\nevaluation, was a change in slot marker color of an aircraft conducting IM. Differentiating the\\nIM trail aircraft was reported as being helpful and controllers appeared to have a better\\nunderstanding of IM spacing behavior and reported seeing aircraft closing to their ASG.\\nHowever, some controllers still expressed concerns about on-going deviations from the slot\\nmarkers in the feeders airspace. They reported that their goal was to get all aircraft into their\\nslot markers so that the handoff to the final controller would be acceptable and that they felt\\nuncomfortable when aircraft were not in the slot markers. 2.5.1.2 IM Status Information on ATC Surveillance Displays\\nTo help controllers actively manage and monitor IM operations, IM status information should\\nbe",
