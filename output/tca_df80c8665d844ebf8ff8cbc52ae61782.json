Case Number 17-4670\\n1 http://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/05/robots-artificial-intelligence-jobs-automation/ The Hope and Challenge of Synthetic Biology* By Jay J. Schnitzer and Peter L. Levin December 2017 By far the most important information known to mankind the human genome \\nis stored in trillions of containers, inside billions of mobile agents, and dynamically \\nrefreshed millions of times per year. Not every update is perfect, and miniscule \\ndeviations can be healthy or self-destructive. But there are so inconceivably many \\ncopies that, taken in aggregate, new versions eventually break ground along a \\nmeandering path that began four thousand millennia ago. Evolution is indifferent \\nto and unencumbered by quarterly reports to an owner; that class of \\nexperimental freedom has created the best innovation of all: life itself. Nature organized this chemical database into forty-six (twenty-three paired) units \\ncalled chromosomes, each written in a deceptively simple four-letter alphabet. \\nOur molecular-scale understanding of the story told in three billion cuneiforms of \\nnucleic acid is only seventy years old, eyeblink short on the time scale it took to \\ncreate its letter-by-letter assembly. Yet we can already connect some metabolic-\\nsignal pathways to their genetic grammar. Until the last century we hardly knew this information existed. Fifty years ago we \\nbegan to attach radioactive isotopes to small segments of chromosomes to see \\nwhere they landed after mitosis. Today we have machines that allow us to actively \\nread-and-write genes by the base-pair, almost like a modern word processor or \\nsoftware development environment. In other words, human-made hardware is now capable of changing the somatic \\nsoftware that runs us, like a computer autonomously downloading new apps it \\nfinds interesting, or willfully changing its operating system. Germline modification \\n the ability to permanently change DNA that is transmitted to offspring is \\ncoming soon. It will be inexpensive, reliable, and generally available. To understand how fast these changes will occur, consider Kevin Drums1 \\nanimation that starkly demonstrates acceleration at Moores Law speed of \\nchange: doubling something every eighteen months. He pretended to fill Lake Schnitzer and Levin Page 2 of 8\\nThe Hope and Challenge of Synthetic Biology December 12, 2017 2 https://www.technologyreview.com/s/427787/are-smart-phones-spreading-faster-than-any-technology-in-\\nhuman-history/\\n3 https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/11/29/cells-with-lab-made-dna-produce-\\na-new-kind-of-protein-a-holy-grail-for-synthetic-biology/?utm_term=.ddef0ed220dc Michigan with water, starting with one fluid ounce, and then two fluid ounces a \\nyear and a half later, and then four fluid ounces three years after he started. After \\nseven decades one can barely detect the results of such make-believe. Yet in only \\nfifteen more years, the lake is full. Put in astronomical context: a little more than a \\ncentury ago we were in the pre-Kitty Hawk days of heavier-than-air flight; two \\ngenerations later we took giant leaps on the moon. Illuminating biological pathways for mischief or profit will occur faster still. The fusion of biotechnology and information science is new and uncharted. For \\nmost of history, information exchange, fake or not, depended upon physical \\naccess, which became sequentially easier with broadcast radio, then broadcast \\ntelevision, and most recently with the internet. The adoption of movable type for \\nmechanical printing took almost exactly 400 years, from Bi Shengs invention to \\nthe Gutenberg Bible. The iPhone moved mainstream adoption of smartphones \\nfrom 5% to 40% a typical metric of comparison in about four years.2 None of these advances remotely exploit the taproot of all information, literally \\nencoded in our DNA. We can already manipulate cell-level outcomes by blocking \\ncertain functions that result in disease. Tomorrow we will change DNA itself to \\nanthropogenically repair mutations that cause problems in the first place. The \\nday after tomorrow we will manipulate molecularly bio-similar instructions \\noutside of a living organism to produce new non-biological materials with \\nproperties we have never seen before, like those reported in November 2017.3 A genetic program of (only) three billion instructions can create a human baby in \\nnine months. Now the underlying technology that reads the code-script, \\nspecifically the ribosomes (software developers would call these compilers) that \\nassemble proteins one amino acid at a time, can be teleologically reverse \\nengineered. Reflect, for example, on the power to genetically modify for strength, \\nintellect, longevity, or control based on the current alphabet of 20 building blocks. \\nImagine synthetically extending the keyboard to include hundreds, thousands, or \\nhundreds of thousands of new letters new amino acids for biological and \\nnon-biological applications. Truly we are at the incunabula stage the quiet Schnitzer and Levin Page 3 of 8\\nThe Hope and Challenge of Synthetic Biology December 12, 2017 4 The Philadelphia Chromosome, by Jessica Wapner, published in 2013 by The Experiment, LLC interregnum between handwritten texts and mass-produced manuscripts in our \\nability to print molecular components whose attributes we-ourselves define. The public health implications of genetic de-coding are breathtaking. Prophylactic \\nvaccinations against communicable disease coupled to curative therapies for \\ncancer, diabetes, and heart disease mean that many of us, particularly in the \\ndeveloped world, will live longer, healthier, and physiologically safer lives. An \\nindividuals opportunity for creative contribution, including especially our \\ncollective scientific understanding, will grow exponentially. Few would want to turn the clock back to an age before anesthetics, x-rays, \\npenicillin, or imatinib4. Fewer still can conceive the convergence of carbon-born \\nethics to silicon-born judgment. Developed-world innovation in artificial \\nintelligence and biochemistry will exacerbate inequality, because it is \\ninstitutionally and infrastructurally farther up the acceleration curve. The emerging miracles of modern biotechnology and biotech-inspired materials \\nscience conceal an existential threat to a fragile balance of international powers, \\nand to our own national security. If not more thoughtfully debated on the global \\nstage and controlled by multi-party agreement, our very existence is challenged \\nby a single laboratory accident or ideologically-driven attack. There are now \\npeople in the world who perform scientific experiments that can lead to morally \\ndisturbing outcomes. There are now people in the world who aim to demolish the \\nfoundational institutions of modern society by any means possible. New systems, \\nespecially those that biomimick natural pathogens and cognitive synthesis, will far \\nexceed our governments ability to control them. Riven enemies can too easily \\nturn them against us and each other; ignorance and prejudice will fuel anger and \\nviolence. Scientific breakthroughs in biochemistry and microbiology will be further \\nadvanced by self-reinforcing capabilities of (irreversible) computer-aided \\ndecisions. For all the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning \\n(ML) and there are many the predictive power of these new technologies is \\nimperfect, and their moral judgment and executive function is nonexistent. Dan Geer, In-Q-Tels chief information security officer, told us that, Our \\nintervention in evolution is just more evolution, but at a faster clock rate. Schnitzer and Levin Page 4 of 8\\nThe Hope and Challenge of Synthetic Biology December 12, 2017 5 https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/ai-versus-md Changes that depend on random perturbations take geologic time, including time \\nto test for side effects. Changes that people design may have just as many \\nunforeseen consequences, but the equilibria they punctuate are of much shorter \\nduration. In other words, machine learning means self-modifying algorithms; it is \\nimpossible to ask them how they made their decisions, and their impact is quick \\nand permanent. The problem, Geer explained, is that nations dont have \\ngeological time-scales to cull for fitness of their machine learning stock. What if \\nthe current generation of people becomes an experiment in evolution? Geoffrey Hinton has wisely observed5 that the algorithm can solve a case. It \\ncannot build a case. In other words, AI and ML are great at deciphering the \\nwhats, wheres, and hows all questions that are essentially answered by \\nextremely sophisticated pattern recognition but they cannot begin to \\nunderstand why, which is the core of the human experience. AI and ML can help \\neven-experienced professionals avoid poor choices, and they can suggest data-\\ndriven hypotheses. But correlation is not causality, and neither can yet replace \\ncompassionate bedside manner, values-based judgement, or face-saving \\ndiplomatic nuance. AI and ML will continue to make marvelous contributions to \\ndiagnosis and classification, but they will not, in our opinion, and certainly not in \\nthe near term, be able to accurately harvest social sentiment or connect \\noutcomes to social values. Even in a data drenched world, data scientists are still unable to predict the \\noutcomes of plebiscites or the weather. And no computer would have anticipated \\nthe physical fatigue, psychological momentum, or miraculous catch that changed \\nthe otherwise prevenient outcome of the final quarter of Super Bowl LI. AI and ML \\nreveal patterns; they cannot ask the right questions, detect insincere answers to \\nnational polls, or hypothesize Julian Edelmans hands. There are no silicon- (or \\neven carbon-) based systems that can stop torture, stop ethnic cleansing, or \\nbetter teach the irrefutable science of climate change. Today we are still untangling the engineering problem of cataloging proteomic \\noutcomes to genetic codes, ribosomal assembly, and the restricted spectrum of \\nnatural components. Soon we will be able to create an editable biochemical code, \\nwith an expanded palette of man-made materials. Civil society must demand \\npolitical leadership engage in open debate to determine if the outcomes are Schnitzer and Levin Page 5 of 8\\nThe",
