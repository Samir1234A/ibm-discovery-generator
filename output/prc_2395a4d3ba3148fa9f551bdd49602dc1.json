Feerrar Date\\nPortfolio Manager\\nNavigation and Unmanned Aircraft Systems iii\\n Executive Summary\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requested that The MITRE Corporation (MITRE) \\nstudy alternative risk assessment methodologies and provide recommendations going forward to \\nsupport the analysis and approvals of small unmanned aircraft system (sUAS) applications and \\nprovide the basis for risk-based decision making. This analysis includes detailed studies of two \\nrisk assessment methodologies exemplifying two different approaches. The MITRE-developed \\nSmall UAS Airworthiness Assessment Tool (sAAT) risk model, currently under development, is \\na quantitative probabilistic model. The Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Systems \\n(JARUS) Specific Operations Risk Assessment (SORA) methodology, also under development, \\nwas selected to represent a knowledge-driven, qualitative risk assessment approach. Each model \\nwas selected based on the maturity of the development efforts as representative of the approach \\nto risk modeling.\\nThe sAAT risk model, developed in collaboration with industry and academia, is designed to \\ncalculate the risk of fatality per flight hour, based on aircraft characteristics, density of people \\nexposed to the flight, reliability of the system, and aircraft kinetic energy (KE) in case of \\ncollision with a person. The risk to the third-party is calculated based on published measurements \\nand coefficients for the aforementioned quantities. The benefit of the sAAT model is an explicit \\nalgorithm that can be validated and verified by other researchers. The sAAT ground risk model is \\nundergoing testing and validation, and an air risk model is in development. The limitations of the \\nsAAT model are primarily its narrow scope and limited set of input risk features. Complex or \\nqualitative inputs, such as human error or onboard safety mitigations, are not included in the \\ncurrent model implementation.\\nIn contrast, the SORA methodology, developed by Working Group 6 of the Joint Authorities for \\nRulemaking of Unmanned Systems (JARUS), is a rule-based, knowledge-driven system, whose \\nrisk inference methods are based on variables, rules, and relationships derived from subject \\nmatter experts. The SORA assessment results in a qualitative categorization of the operation into \\none of six different Specific Assurance and Integrity Levels (SAIL). It then recommends \\nobjectives to be met for each SAIL. The scope of risk factors being considered is broad and wide-\\nranging. Compared to the sAAT risk model, the benefits of SORA are an expanded set of risk \\nfactors, the ability to incorporate a large variety of risk factor types (quantitative and qualitative) \\nand unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) community model development. Limitations of SORA \\ninclude the subjectivity of model inputs and complexity of the process. \\nThe goal of these models is to support an analysis that considers the combination of the aircraft \\nand the intended mission, and provides an overall safety risk assessment of the operation from \\nboth the air and ground perspective.\\nThe assessment of alternatives was based on a set of evaluation criteria, such as the complexity, \\nscope, input parameters, outputs/results, risk factors examined, and mitigation factors examined. \\nBased on the evaluation that follows, it is recommended that the FAA: Come to agreement on standardized safety thresholds and acceptable levels of risk to 1.\\nguide sUAS risk assessments.\\nUse a holistic review process such as the SORA (once finalized) or the FAA safety 2.\\nmanagement system (SMS) assessment processes for those operations in the higher risk \\ncategories and/or with a required need for increased oversight.\\nInvest in the development of semi-automated functions when the SORA methodology is 3. iv\\n finalized and standardize the wide variety of inputs and integration of standardized safety \\nthresholds. \\nConsider using the sAAT model to identify the operations with the lowest risk.

The FAA desires an \\nevaluation approach that is timely and efficient to calculate the key risk factors in sUAS \\nmissions, and provide an actionable risk assessment in the form of an airworthiness approval. \\nThe approach should: Determine if the mission achieves the required level of safety\\nIndicate the highest risk contributors and, Identify the possible risk mitigations for excessive mission risk\\nCurrent risk assessment methods assume worst-case conditions wherein an sUAS failure would \\nalways achieve its maximum kinetic energy (KE) prior to impact and would always result in a \\ncollision with a third-party (uninvolved) individual on the ground or possible mid-air collision \\nwith a legacy manned aircraft. These worst-case assessments produce conservative risk estimates \\nand limit the ability of the FAA to enable the growing demand for sUAS operations. Purpose1.1\\nThe FAA requested that the MITRE Corporation (MITRE) evaluate alternative risk assessment \\nmethodologies to provide a recommendation for approving sUAS applications and provide the \\nbasis for risk-based decision making. This report contains an overview and comparison of two \\ntypes of sUAS assessment methodologies, both of which are still in development: Joint Authorities for Rulemaking of Unmanned Systems (JARUS) Specific Operations \\nRisk Assessment (SORA)\\nMITRE-developed Small UAS Airworthiness Assessment Tool (sAAT) This document details the basic requirements of a risk assessment model and its inputs and \\ndesired outcomes, as well as dimensions for comparisons. The purpose of this work is to inform \\nthe FAA on alternative risk assessment approaches to streamline and improve the accuracy of the \\nairworthiness assessment process. \\nThe FAA typically certificates the airworthiness of the aircraft, certifies the qualification of the \\ncrew, and grants operational approval for the operation. This document does not distinguish \\nwhich part of this process would be assessing risk as these risk methods could be applied to either \\nthe airworthiness of the aircraft or the safety of the operation. Approach1.2\\nMITRE compared the JARUS SORA approach to identify the similarities and differences with \\nthe sAAT risk model. The sAAT is a quantitative risk model that encompasses academic and \\nindustry knowledge and research along with aircraft and mission parameters to develop \\nprobabilistic risks of an sUAS collision with people on the ground (third-parties) which results in \\na fatality. \\nThe SORA approach was selected because of its standing with the international community. This ii\\n qualitative approach uses a variety of non-numerical input and results in a risk assessment of \\nrelative operations. It has been under development with participation by many nation states and \\ncivil aviation authorities. \\nThe detailed studies of the two methodologies were used to identify the strengths and weaknesses \\nof each approach. Using a set of evaluation criteria, MITRE compared the similarities and \\ndifferences of the two methodologies, which informed the set of recommendations. i\\n Risk Assessment2\\nRisk assessment is a systematic safety evaluation of a situation or activity. It involves the \\nidentification of hazards or vulnerabilities, along with an assessment of their likelihoods and \\nseverity. A formal model of a process or endeavor will expose and describe its hazards and \\nconsequences. Application of such a model enables a consistent and comprehensive assessment \\nof risk factors, as well as",
