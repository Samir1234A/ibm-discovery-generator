For example, goal commitment can be low when the vii wrong behavior is unintentionally rewarded. Finally, some employees are motivated by \\nthings other than rewards, in particular a belief in public service; employees may want to \\n\\\"get the biggest bang for the buck\\\" for the intended beneficiaries of their programs, and \\nthat bang depends, in part, on Payment Integrity. Motivating Recipients of Federal Payments \\nApplied literature and research indicated that motivators to be accurate and not make \\nerrors or commit fraud when submitting claims to the government can arise from sources \\nboth extrinsic and intrinsic to the individual. Extrinsic motivation usually focuses on \\nelements of the economics-of-crime model. The model is most frequently applied to tax \\nevasion, wherein many believe the probability of being examined and the magnitude of the \\npossible penalty correlate with the overall level of compliance. In reality, while the \\npossibility of examination and penalty appears to have a predictive relationship with \\nindividual behavior, taxpayers as a whole do not appear to make their compliance \\ndecisions solely based on the likelihood of being examined. Extrinsic motivation can also derive from the characteristics of the environment. For \\nexample, the ability to obtain all necessary information and have it presented in clear and \\nstraightforward ways better motivates individuals and organizations to make good \\ncompliance decisions. However, this is not always the case with government programs. Multiple intrinsic factors can affect tax compliance, such as perceived fairness of the tax \\nsystem and the authorities, and acceptance of tax evasion among a reference group such as \\nan individuals friends. Other nonpecuniary motivators for tax compliance include concepts \\nlike reciprocal motivationthe willingness to pay taxes in exchange for benefits that \\ngovernment provides even though the actual payoff would be higher by not paying. Based on interviews with agency and accountability officials, as well as review of applied \\nliterature and research, we concluded that just as with motivating agencies and entities \\nthat act on their behalf, visibility and accountability can motivate claimants. Organizations \\ncan take numerous actions to promote visibility and accountability in hopes of motivating \\nclaimants to be accurate and not make errors or commit fraud, such as using compliance \\nactions to increase levels of claimant responsibility, informing claimants that their \\ninformation will be shared with other agencies for matching as a deterrent, and publicizing \\npenalties for noncompliance. Finally, applied literature and researched showed that how claimants view agencies plays a \\nrole, especially the reputation of an agency, which is key to the level of claimants trust. \\nBoosting the level of trust in and / or the perception of power of agency authorities leads to \\ngreater compliance. viii Recommendations \\nOMB and agencies can fundamentally transform the entire system by implementing the \\nfollowing recommendations in order to create the conditions for optimal Payment \\nIntegrity. Table ES-1. Study Recommendations Motivating Agencies Motivating Recipients 1. Set clear organizational goals for Payment \\nIntegrity with accountability for results 8. Ensure claimants have easy, optimal means to \\ninteract with agencies 2. Establish a culture of Payment Integrity 9. Strive for proactive, timely communications \\nwith claimants 3. More closely balance the priorities of mission \\nand management 10. Broaden use of compliance-oriented motivators \\nsuch as data mining 4. Emphasize coordinated, cross-government \\napproaches to Payment Integrity challenges 11. Consider additional compliance motivators, as \\nwarranted 5. Address statutory barriers 6. Explore funding options to strengthen Payment \\nIntegrity 7. Consider Payment Integrity when modernizing \\ninformation technology systems and \\ndeveloping shared services ix Table of Contents Acknowledgments \\nTheir Ongoing Payment Integrity Efforts? \\nTax Returns, Commercial Invoices, Etc.to Be Accurate and Not Make Errors or \\nCommit Fraud? \\nFigure 2. Overall Tax Compliance as a Function of Trust and Power \\nTable 2. Study Interviews \\n(OMB), the federal government annually makes more \\nthan $3 trillion in payments of all kindsdirect \\nentitlement payments, grants, loans, acquisitions, and \\nmore. The great majority of payments are proper\\nmade to the correct person or organization, for the right \\nreason, at the right time, in the correct amount. However, in fiscal year (FY) 2016 federal agencies, using their own methods and available \\ndata, estimated that there were more than $144 billion in improper payments (nearly 4.7 \\npercent of all payments) for about 115 of the hundreds of federal programs, representing \\nthe equivalent of the net cost of the fifth largest federal agency. Given the limited number of \\nprograms for which estimates are calculated, the complexity of the estimates, and the \\ndifficulty of estimating fraud, this may very well be a lower bound to the actual improper \\npayments that year. Considerable efforts are already in place at OMB and across federal agencies to identify, \\nreport and mitigate improper payments. However, the level of improper payments has \\nnearly tripled over the last decade, is unaffordable, adds to the current difficult economic \\npicture, and contributes to public concerns about the effectiveness of the governments \\nstewardship over taxpayer dollars. The MITRE Corporation (MITRE), a not-for-profit organization that operates federally \\nfunded research and development centers (FFRDC) on behalf of federal government \\nsponsors, recognizes the impact that the overall federal Payment Integrity4 situation has on \\ngovernment effectiveness and public confidence. Given the public interest nature of this \\nchallenge, MITRE conducted this independent study as a follow-on to its February 2016 \\nreport5 that assessed the underlying systemic factors that enable fraud and other improper \\npayments and explored government-wide solutions to improve Payment Integrity. This \\nstudy focuses on a key issue that impacts the implementation of many of the \\nrecommendations made in the February 2016 reportwhat motivates federal agencies, \\nthose acting on their behalf (for example, states, grantees), and claimants to optimize their \\nongoing Payment Integrity efforts? In conducting this qualitative study, MITRE interviewed officials at 9 agencies and 4 \\noversight and accountability organizations. MITRE also reviewed extensive academic \\nliterature, domestic and international applied literature, and research. MITRE then \\nassessed this information in the context of motivators specific to Payment Integrity. See \\nAppendix A for a complete description of the study methodology. \\n4 Payment Integrity refers to improper payments and the people, processes, and technology that are meant to ensure that \\nthe payments are actually proper. \\n5 GOVERNMENT-WIDE PAYMENT INTEGRITY: NEW APPROACHES AND SOLUTIONS NEEDED (MTR160040, February \\n2016) 2 1.1 Federal Requirements Regarding Payment Integrity Congressional concerns over government-wide Payment Integrity \\nhave, in recent years, prompted passage of a number of important pieces of legislation \\naimed at helping the federal government address the problem. These statutes include the \\nfollowing. The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-300), the Improper \\nPayments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA) of 2010 (P.L. 111-204), and the \\nImproper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act (IPERIA) of 2012 \\n(P.L. 112-248), which collectively: o Require federal agencies to annually review all programs and activities and \\nidentify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments. o Require federal agencies, for those programs and activities identified, to \\nestimate the annual amount of improper payments. o Establish in statute the Do Not Pay (DNP) Initiative and require federal agencies \\nto ensure that a thorough review of available databases with relevant \\ninformation on eligibility occurs to determine program or award eligibility. The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-101), which \\nauthorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a data analysis center or \\nexpand an existing service to provide data, analytic tools, and data management \\ntechniques to support, among other things, the prevention and reduction of \\nimproper payments.6 The Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-186), which focuses \\nagencies attention on identifying, assessing, and mitigating fraud risks, including \\nthe use of data analytics. The Executive Branch has also taken a number of steps aimed at improving Payment \\nIntegrity government-wide. These include: Issuing Executive Order 13520, Reducing Improper Payments and Eliminating Waste \\nin Federal Programs (November 20, 2009), which established a strategic outcome, \\ngoals and strategies for reducing improper payments. Issuing a Presidential Memorandum (Enhancing Payment Accuracy Through a Do \\nNot Pay List [June 18, 2010]) and OMB memoranda (M-12-11, Reducing Improper \\nPayments through the \\\"Do Not Pay List [April 12, 2012] and M-13-20, Protecting \\nPrivacy while Reducing Improper Payments with the Do Not Pay Initiative [August 16, \\n2013]), which established the Treasury DNP solution and provided guidance to \\nagencies on its use, prior to passage of IPERIA. \\n6 Treasury officials evaluated the provision, concluded that a Bureau of the Fiscal Service post-payment center in \\nPhiladelphia fulfills the intent of this provision, and decided not to invoke the authority provided. 3 Issuing OMB memorandum M-15-02, Appendix C to Circular No. A-123, \\nRequirements for Effective Estimation and Remediation of Improper Payments \\n(October 20, 2014), which, among other things, established new categories for \\nreporting improper payments and introduced a new internal control framework. Establishing a goal of a government-wide improper payments rate of no more than \\n3.0 percent by the end of FY 2016. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has",
