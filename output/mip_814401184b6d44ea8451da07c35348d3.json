  "text": "The means were relatively higher, and the variability lower, for the 45/24 and 35/20 values for \\nthe CSL than the other conditions. This suggests greater controller agreement on the \\neffectiveness of these alert timing values for the CSL than the 25/15 value. For the WSL, the \\nrelatively higher mean and lower variability for the 35/20 value suggests greater controller \\nagreement on the effectiveness of this value than the other two. Selected open-ended comments for this question included: (Non-NCT TRACON / 45/24) Not easily, but definitely could guess with confidence when \\na deviation on the CSL would occur.\\n(Non-NCT TRACON / 25/15) The more I watch scenarios, the better I become at \\npredicting if the a/c will or will not stay behind the CSL. The automation helps in addition \\nto this (i.e., warning and caution).\\n(NCT / 45/24) Definitely works better w/ preview line, so I don't have to narrow my focus \\nto the area where the WSL pops up.\\n(Non-NCT TRACON / 25/15) [WSL is] more difficult than CSL assessment because WSL is \\neffective so late on final. The warning helped. --------------------------------- After all the Alert Timing scenarios were run (QT5), controllers were asked: how many seconds \\nbefore the IM Trail Aircraft crosses the CSL would you like to see the Predictive and Caution \\nAlerts. Participants were allowed to enter any value they liked. Responses are shown in Figure \\n5-62 for Week 2-3 TRACON (NCT and non-NCT combined) and Tower Only. lxxviii\\n Figure 5-62. How many seconds before the IM Trail Aircraft crosses the CSL would you like to see the \\nPredictive and Caution Alerts? With respect to the CSL, the majority of Week 2-3 TRACON controllers responded with 35 \\nseconds for the Predictive Alert. Controllers tied between 15 and 20 seconds for the Caution \\nAlert. After all the Alert Timing scenarios were run (QT5), controllers were also asked: how many \\nseconds before the IM Trail Aircraft crosses the WSL would you like to see the Predictive and \\nCaution Alerts. Participants were allowed to enter any value they liked. Responses are shown in \\nFigure 5-63 for Week 2-3 TRACON (NCT and non-NCT combined) and Tower Only. Figure 5-63. How many seconds before the IM Trail Aircraft crosses the WSL would you like to see the \\nPredictive and Caution Alerts? With respect to the WSL, the majority of Week 2-3 TRACON controllers responded with 35 \\nseconds for the Predictive Alert. TRACON controllers tied between 15 and 20 seconds for the \\nCaution Alert. In the comments, one participant noted for the Caution Alert: Timing depends \\non type of position responsible for the aircraft pairs at the time. With a monitor, no less than 15 \\nseconds. With a local or final, 24 seconds seems reasonable. Alert Response Times6.5.4.3\\nAs described in Section 4.5.4, Day 3 for each week included a self-contained evaluation of \\nalternate longitudinal alert timings. The analysis in this section examined whether lower alert \\ntimings than those chosen for ATPA affected controller response time to a Caution Alert, as \\nreduced timings may ultimately be used to mitigate against nuisance alerts (which would occur \\nmore frequently with greater timings). Three sets of alert timing values were investigated in the \\nHITL as levels of the Alert Timing Independent Variable and are shown in Table 5-52. Table 5-52. Alert Timing Independent Variable Levels Predictive Alert Time (sec) Caution Alert Time (sec) Set X 45 24 Set Y 35 20 Set Z 25 15 The different alert timings were only examined in the context of the Combined Monitor lxxix\\n configuration. All of the IM PA-related tools described previously were available to the \\nCombined Monitor controller. The counterbalancing of the timing values used in the HITL is \\nshown in Table 4-12. As noted in Section 4.5.7.2, objective data was collected with respect to controller PTT times, \\naircraft state, and longitudinal alerting. The PTT data caveats described in Section 5.1.2 apply \\nhere. In sum, if the Local controller or pseudopilot was talking on the frequency, participants \\ncould not break in to override. They were, however, told to still click their handsets when they \\nwanted to speak. The first click that was recorded after an event of interest was used as a \\nproxy for the controller response time to resolve a situation. It was generally assumed that the \\nfirst click that was recorded after an event of interest represented the controller response time \\nto resolve a situation. Though this is likely to be a safe assumption generally, there were five cases in which unusually \\nlong delays (> 11 sec) were observed between the Caution Alert and the next PTT click. The \\nlowest of these values were eight or more times higher than the other average responses and \\nmore than twice the average controller response times to the NTZ Warnings reported in Cox, \\nYates, & Savage (2011). These cases were further examined and it was found that there was also \\na very short time difference between the preceding PTT click and the Caution Alert. These likely \\nrepresented instances in which the controller felt confident that the aircraft would receive a \\nCaution Alert and therefore intervened just before the alert actually occurred. These five \\ninstances were removed from the data, resulting in different n values per condition, and are \\nfurther discussed later in this section. PTT response time Means and Standard Deviations are summarized in Table 5-53. Responses \\nare shown for all TRACON (NCT and non-NCT combined) for each alert timing value. Due to a \\ntechnical issue in Week 1 that affected the Alert Timing scenarios, only the Week 2-3 TRACON \\ncontroller responses are included in the analysis. Table 5-53. Average Controller PTT Response Time (sec) After Caution Alert Alert Timing (Predictive / Caution) 45 / 24 sec 35 / 20 sec 25 / 15 sec\\nCSL Caution Alert Sample Size (n) 16 16 15 Mean (M) 1.8 sec 1.1 sec 1.5 sec Standard Deviation (SD) 2.7 1.6 1.9 WSL Caution Alert\\nSample Size (n) 9 10 10 Mean (M) 1.0 sec 0.9 sec 1.4 sec Standard Deviation (SD) 1.0 1.2 1.8 Total\\nSample Size (n) 25 26 25 lxxx\\n Mean (M) 1.5 sec 1.0 sec 1.5 sec Standard Deviation (SD) 2.2 1.4 1.8 The HITL data shows that on average, controllers responded (via a PTT click) to Caution \\nAlerts within approximately 1-2 seconds. Note this does not suggest controllers first \\nnoticed the Caution Alert 1-2 seconds after it occurred; these values only represent the \\ntime between the Caution Alert display and the next PTT click of the participants \\nhandset. To examine whether alert timing had an effect on PTT Response times, a single-factor \\nANOVA test was performed. Due to the three levels of the Alert Timing Independent \\nVariable, the Bonferroni correction was used to control for the potential for familywise \\nerror. The probability of finding an effect when there was none, alpha (), was set to \\n0.05. The results are shown in Table 5-54. Table 5-54. Controller PTT Response Time After Caution Alert: Single Factor ANOVA Results SS df MS F p-value Significant?\\nBetween Groups 4.30 2 2.15 0.64 0.53 no Within Groups 246.48 73 3.38\\nTotal 250.78 75 3.34 The statistical analysis results from the simulation suggest there was no significant \\ndifference between average controller response times for any of the three alert timings \\n(p = 0.53). --------------------------------- As noted earlier, five out of 82 (6%) cases were observed in which controllers appeared to have \\nintervened with an aircraft before it triggered a Caution Alert. Three of these were with the \\n45/24 timing and three were with the 35/20 timing. Four of the five cases were related to a WSL \\nalert and one was related to a CSL alert. Overall there were too few occurrences to suggest any \\ntrends. Display Implementation6.5.4.4\\nAs described in Section 4.2.7, an alert was indicated by both the respective safety limit line and \\ndata block numeric indicator changing color. To determine if controllers might exhibit a display \\npreference for the Predictive Alert, they were asked after all the Alert Timing scenarios were run \\n(QT5) if it was helpful to indicate the Predictive Alert via the [Data Block Line 3 / CSL or WSL \\nline] color change. Responses are shown for all TRACON (NCT and non-NCT combined) and \\nTower Only. Response Means and Standard Deviations are summarized in Table 5-55. Scale \\nresponses are shown in Figure 5-64. One NCT and one Tower participant did not respond to this \\nquestion, therefore n=9 for the TRACON controller responses and n=1 for the Tower responses. Table 5-55.
