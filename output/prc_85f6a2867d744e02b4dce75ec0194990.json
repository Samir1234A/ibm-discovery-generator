  "text": "direct energy transfer, the eclipse path efficiency and daylight path efficiency were approximated as 0.65 and 0.85, respectively; for peak-power tracking, eclipse path efficiency is estimated at 0.60 while daylight path efficiency is estimated at 0.80 (page 643 of SME: The New SMAD [1]). STK was used to calculate the length of the eclipse and daylight periods per orbit, and the required power production from the solar array was calculated. Generally, the third step in the solar array design process is the selection of the type of solar cell; however, since the model for this analysis is conducting a trade-study to determine the best solar cell balancing area and cost, all three solar cells were included. Table 2-2 details solar cell efficiencies for each type (page 645 of SME: The New SMAD [1]). Cell Type Silicon Gallium Arsenide Multijunction Theoretical Efficiency 29% 23.5% 40+% Achieved Efficiency: Production Efficiency Best Laboratory 22% 24.7% 18.5% 21.8% 30.0% 33.8% = \\n = ! = \\\"# $ \\n %& ! = \\\"# $ %& \\n ' = \\n \\n$$# \\n ' = \\n$$# Table 2-2 Performance Comparison for Photovoltaic Solar Cells Figure 2-3 Solar Array Power Equation 2-10 While silicon cells are mature in their development and can have lower cost in environments where radiation is not a concern, multijunction cells have become the standard for space applications despite their high cost. What makes them the #1 choice is their high efficiency resulting in less area required to produce the same amount of power comparative to silicon cells. Using the best laboratory efficiencies provided above, the power output for each solar cell is calculated by multiplying the efficiency by the solar constant 1,368 W/(). \\n Next, the beginning-of-life (BOL) power per unit area is determined using the following equation: *+, = -.\\n cos 2 The solar cell power output calculation is provided in the previous step when the solar cell type is selected. Inherent degradation quantifies the loss in performance and is assumed to be 0.77 (page 644 of SME: The New SMAD [1]). Lastly, the sun incidence angle is the angle between the vector normal to the surface of the array and the Sun line. Although, the solar panel is configured to minimize this cosine loss, it is assumed that theta is equal to 23.5 degrees in order to model an industry standard worst-case Sun angle assumption to ensure power production requirements are always met (page 647 of SME: The New SMAD [1]). The last step is the calculation of the EOL power per unit area which can then be used in conjunction with the solar array power calculated in the first step to calculate the area required. = 3 4 %5 5 6 78 : ; = ;## # < = 35# ;## =# Figure 2-4 Beginning-of-Life Power Equation 2-11 >\\n = 1 A, \\n B+, = *+,>\\n C = B+, Several factors degrade a solar panels performance. Lifetime degradation of the solar panel occurs due to thermal cycling, material degradation, and space debris impact among others. First, the lifetime degradation can be calculated by the first equation in Figure 2-5 for which the degradation per year for silicon, gallium arsenide, and multijunction are 3.75%, 2.75%, and 0.5%, respectively (page 647 of SME: The New SMAD [1]). Next, the end-of-life power was calculated using the beginning-of-life power and lifetime degradation (2nd equation in Figure 2- 5). Finally, the solar array area can be calculated by dividing the solar array power by the end- of-life power, and the mass of the solar array is estimated by multiplying the solar array power by .04. 2.5.4 Battery Sizing Energy storage plays a vital role in the electrical-power subsystem allowing the spacecraft to continue operating in eclipse periods and peak-power demands. For the satellite under consideration with a thirteen-year design life, secondary (rechargeable) batteries were selected. Although Nickel-Cadmium and Nickel-Hydrogen are commonly used secondary batteries, Lithium-Ion was selected based on its significant volumetric and energy density advantages. \\\" = \\\"$ 7 # = # D E = 3 \\\"$ 7 D \\n%\\\" = \\n# $ \\\"$ 6 78 : F%\\\" = F### $ \\\"$ 6 78 : = = 3 = = 78 = 3 = \\nFigure 2-5 End-of-Life Power and Solar Array Area Equation 2-12 The spacecrafts orbital parameters, especially altitude, determine the number of charge/discharge cycles the battery must support. According to page 650 of SME: The New SMAD [1], the depth-of-discharge (DOD) is limited to 30% for LEO spacecraft. As a result, the cycle life is increased but the amount of energy available from the batteries during each cycle is decreased. To determine the size of the batteries (battery capacity), only one equation is required. G = AHAIJ The eclipse power and length of eclipse per orbit are defined in the solar panel sizing portion of the code. Next, the DOD is estimated at 0.30 based on the LEO orbit. Lastly, the number of batteries is generally set at two or more for redundancy, and the transmission efficiency is estimated at 90% (page 653 of SME: The New SMAD [1]). 2.5.5 Power System Model Outputs With all equations and variables defined, the power system model is complete. The solar array and battery information was outputted in the GUI that accomplishes the trade-study task. Figure 2-7 shows an example output. 4 = F 4 (W-hr) = \\n ! = \\\"# $ \\n %& % = $ 6 78 : = 57& $ F # = !#7# \\n$$# \\nFigure 2-6 Battery Capacity Equation 2-13 2.6 Delta-V (V) Estimate Working with the rocket equation, the V budget was used to create a propellant budget and estimate the propellant mass required for the space mission. Higher orbits require more propellant for orbit acquisition and de-orbit but less propellant for on-orbit maintenance. With an altitude of 1000 km, an accurate estimation method is needed. On page 253 of SME: The New SMAD [1], Figure 10-16 provides V budget as a function of altitude for LEO. Using this figure, at an orbit of 1000 km, the V budget is estimated at 691.22 m/s for a design life of thirteen years. Figure 2-7 Satellite Power System Model Output 2-14 2.7 Spacecraft Bus Dry Mass Estimate With first order estimates of the payload mass, power system mass, and the V budget, a first order dry mass estimate was derived so that an ADCS could be designed. First, the payload total mass was calculated by adding the weight of the RF transmitters and the laser communication units. Once the payload mass was calculated, all other first order mass estimates, excluding the power mass estimate (which has already been calculated) were derived from the usage of Table 2-3 (page 422 of SME: The New SMAD [1]).

For this specific scenario, 64.5 kg would be divided by 0.31 Table 2-3 Average Mass by Subsystem for 4 Types of Spacecraft 2-15 (average payload percentage of dry mass for LEO spacecraft with propulsion) to calculate a total dry mass. Once this total dry mass has been estimated, the percentage for each subsystem was multiplied by the total dry mass until all subsystems masses were calculated. The total dry estimate listed in the results is slightly greater than the estimate provided using this method due to the power mass estimate from the satellite power system model being used instead of the 21% listed in SME: The New SMAD [1]. 2.8 Propulsion System Mass Model The spacecraft dry mass and V budget estimates allow for the estimation of the propulsion systems mass. For preliminary design, the rocket equation was utilized to estimate the propellant mass. KL = KM[OQ RSTUVW 1] The V needed is within the range for monopropellant thrusters. Subsequently, hydrazine was selected as the fuel resulting in a modest .L estimate of 218 seconds. All remaining variables are \\nknown from previous calculations, and the propellant mass was computed. Next, KL_Z[\\\\ was defined as the propellant mass plus the fuel needed for attitude \\ncontrol. The fuel needed for attitude control is much smaller than the propellant mass needed to meet the V, so for a first order estimate, it was assumed to be 9% of the total propellant mass. Not all the propellant loaded into a tank is usable however. As a result, a 3% margin is applied to the usable propellant to account for propellant trapped in the tank, feed lines, or valves [3].
