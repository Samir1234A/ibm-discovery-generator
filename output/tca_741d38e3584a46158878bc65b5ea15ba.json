  "text": "times of actual or expected weather constraints. Those TMIs push delay to upstream facilities. [9] TIM had poor R2 performance at each of the airports studied. This is likely due to the effect of airport surface \\ncongestion, which was not directly included in the regressors. The poor quality of TIM R2 performance did not have \\na large impact on BMAB performance even though it is one of the components of block time. The other two components of BMAB, ATER and TOM, had R2 values that aligned well with those values for \\nBMAB. It was expected that TOM would match BMAB well because much of the variation in block time comes \\nfrom variation in predeparture operations. Once the flight is in the air, variation in flight time is limited. Comparing the fits for ATER and FDAB at each airport is a useful exercise for model verification because the \\ntwo metrics are measured for the same portion of flight (i.e., from Off to In). ATER and FDAB had very similar \\nR2 results at each airport studied. The largest difference between the performance of the two variables was at A8 \\nwhere ATER was .37 and FDAB was .59. Further study would be needed to determine the underlying cause of this \\ndifference at the airport. B. Review anomalous period results for each airport across metrics.\\nAs mentioned above, two types of anomalous periods were identified in this analysis: periods where the adjusted performance was worse than expected, and periods where the adjusted performance was better than expected. One \\ncheck for internal consistency was to show that, at a given airport, there were no overlapping periods that were \\ndefined as underperforming under one KPI and overperforming under a different KPI. 22 C. Review consistency between FDAB and ATER results. \\nThey should be roughly in agreement because they measure performance for the same segment of a flight (the Off to On segment). The results of the FDAB KPI and the ATER KPI were consistent, though not perfectly in \\nalignment. Problematic periods identified using FDAB did not overlap with those identified using ATER (see Figure \\nFig. 13 above); however, they were also not in conflict (i.e., periods of overperformance under one metric did not \\noverlap with periods of underperformance with the other). VII. Conclusions and Next Steps\\nIn conclusion, this analysis provides a promising approach for streamlining post-operations analysis. It achieves this through a formal method that accounts for weather and demand in evaluating performance across eight KPIs. It \\nthen applies statistical tests to identify trends of over- or under-performance associated with different airports. The \\nmodels that were developed passed several consistency checks, indicating readiness for further validation. There are two main recommendations for next steps aimed at improving the accuracy of the models and building \\nvisualization tools to help users interpret the model results. The first recommendation is to adjust the models to \\ninclude the impact of forecast weather as well as the impact of the actual weather (this study was limited to actual \\nweather impacts). Traffic management decisions are usually made in advance based on forecasts of capacity and \\ndemand changes, so forecast weather is a critical driver of performance. Further, metrics should be developed to explicitly reflect the accuracy of weather forecasts by comparing the \\nforecasts to the observed weather. This comparison should also account for the lead time of multiple forecasts for \\neach time-period (e.g., 8 hours ahead, 4 hours ahead, and 2 hours ahead). The importance of different lead times may \\ndiffer for different airports due to the characteristics of its flights. Airports on the coasts must make TFM decisions 6-\\n8 hours ahead of time to be able to significantly affect transcontinental arrivals. The second recommendation is to prototype user-facing visualizations that present the results in understandable \\nand actionable ways. This would be the first step in developing a capability driven by these models to inform post-\\noperations decision making. Such a capability would help quickly identify areas of under- or over-performance and \\nallow the FAA to begin addressing problems (or identifying best practices) shortly after they arise.
