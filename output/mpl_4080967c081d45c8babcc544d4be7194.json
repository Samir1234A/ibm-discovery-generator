Summary In this experiment, we simulated an integrated operation of \\nTBFM and AFST using the proposed platform. The operational \\nscenario demonstrated that following the AFST rerouting of \\nflights meant that weather had little impact on the stability of the \\nmetering schedule, i.e., most STAs to the MFs could be met \\nwithin an acceptable level of conformance. In follow-on research we plan to use this simulation platform \\nand expand the analysis to additional operational scenarios to \\nbetter understand the ability and also the limitation of AFST \\nfinding usable reroutes around/through weather. If too few \\nreroutes are found, then flights may make unplanned deviations \\naround weather, TBFM and TAAM ETAs will be out of sync, \\nassigned STAs will not be unachievable, and metering will be \\nineffective and turned off. On the other hand, if a sufficient \\nproportion, say 90% of weather-blocked flights2 receive viable \\nreroutes, then benefits of keeping TBFM active can be achieved. \\nOf course, in real-world application, a traffic manager may see \\nreroute opportunities which the AFST algorithm does not \\nidentify. In the posited scenario, positive benefits will accrue via the \\nimproved efficiency of metering, compared to MITs. Also of \\npositive benefit, reroutes may likely reduce tactical ATC \\nmaneuvers, implying reduced controller workload in the adverse \\nconditions of severe en route weather. VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS We have built a flexible, distributed simulation platform for \\nfacilitating TFM integration studies. The platform allows \\nrealistic prototypes of proposed or fielded TFM capabilities to \\ninteract with each other and influence simulated air traffic. A \\ndedicated air traffic simulator played the role of advancing \\nflights in time and space and of evaluating the actions derived \\nfrom the TFM capabilities. This addressed the need of using \\nadvanced TFM capabilities for conducting integration studies or \\nquantifying benefits. Such a simulation platform can not only support simulating \\nTFM interactions but also promote the reuse and interoperability \\nof the existing prototypes or modeling capabilities the plug-\\nand-play facility of the platform eliminates the need for the ad \\nhoc design of each new study. An initial experiment simulated AFST and TBFM under \\nconditions of severe en route weather. AFST demonstrated an \\nability to construct viable weather-avoidance reroutes. When \\nthese reroutes were implemented prior to the FH, metering \\ngenerated achievable STAs. Future work will investigate the \\nsuccess rate of AFST constructing reroutes. \\n2 Subject Matter Experts at MITRE CAASD have suggested that if more than about 10% of the metered flights cant meet their STAs, then metering would be deactivated.

  "text": "edges in transition regions. F. Spatial/Spectral Methods Fan and Messinger [25] describe a graph-based hyperspectral image classification technique based on a split/merge paradigm using normalized cuts with a locally adaptive spatial/spectral graph. The spatial/spectral similarity graph is based on a Shi and Malik [26] construction composed of the product of feature similarity and spatial proximity terms. Fan and Messingers adaptation replaces the feature space term (left) with a ZMP variant using locally adaptive scaling as shown in (4). \\n3 NICDM is not a distance metric as it only satisfies positivity and symmetry axioms, but not the triangle inequality, see [37]. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n= 2 2\\n2 exp\\n),( exp\\nd ji jiij ji ij vv c vvd\\nw \\n (4) The left hand side of (4) represents a Gaussian weighted locally-scaled spectral Euclidean distance, i.e., a spectral diffusion function similar to that in the ZMP method. The local scaling parameters, a and b, are defined in [27] as the \\ndistance to the kth nearest neighbor; however in this treatment the number of nearest neighbors, 8, is determined by the \\nadaptive nearest neighbor method (Section II-D). The additional scaling term in the denominator of (4), R, is \\nan integer indicating the number of common neighbors between nodes i and j. This offers some protection from joining disparate regions by increasing the weight between nodes in the same cluster. Fig, 3 shows two cases where the weight between AC is increased compared to that of AB despite being the same distance away because A and C have common neighbors. In Fig 3a, the shared neighbor adjustment drives down the weight for edge AB despite pixel A and B having the same density. Whereas in Fig 3b, the weight is reduced more due to the smaller relative density of pixel B to pixel A (bc <\\nbe. The right hand side of (4) is a spatial diffusion (dampening) adjustment that performs two tasks: 1) it promotes connections between spatially proximal pixels (small ), \\nenforcing spatial coherence present in imagery and 2) inhibits growth of larger disjoint scene-wide clusters despite any apparent spectral similarity. As such, the graph becomes overly segmented and must undergo a merging step to generate a classification map. The spatial dampening constant, b, limits the size of \\nspatially contiguous regions and is the only user-defined parameter. Gillis and Bowles [29] encode both spatial and spectral information into weights associated with only spatial neighbors. Constructing the graph in this way reduces the number of edges and facilitates faster solutions due to sparser matrix operations. The weights are defined by spectrally- modified spatial diffusion kernel given by (5) for all pixels \\nFig. 3. Weight adjustment based on common nearest neighbors [modified from 25]. Intuitively nodes A and C are more similar than nodes A and B due to community structure. This aspect is reinforced via use of shared nearest neighbors in determining the edge weights. (a) clusters of similar density separated in space and (b) close clusters of dissimilar density further amplifying separation due to the smaller scale associated with pixel B.

The weighting has a similar general form to that described in Fan and Messinger, but the weights are only encoded for those pixels within the r x r spatial neighborhood. A spatial/spectral approach called locally weighted nearest neighbors is described by Mercovich in [13]. In this method, pixels are connected to their 8 = i + k nearest neighbors, \\nwhere g represents the number of global neighbors determined by the k-NN algorithm (any of the k-NN methods previously described would suffice) and l represents the number of local neighbors confined to a window centered on the pixel. The spectral angle between the test pixel and all pixels within a user-defined local spatial neighborhood is computed and the l pixels with the smallest spectral angle are also connected to the test pixel. Fig. 4 provides a synthetic example indicating the local and global pixels with red triangles and green dots at the pixel center respectively. A pixels local neighborhood is indicated by a dotted black box centered on the pixel of interested. The best global neighbors may also be the best local neighbors, so each pixel is not guaranteed to have an out degree of k. This graph is also directed and must be made symmetric by one of the two methods previously discussed in Section II-B. Mercovich describes method performance with five local and 25 global neighbors. Increasing local connectivity in this manner facilitates segmentation, clustering, and classification if regions demonstrate spatial coherence. Additionally, using spectral angle within a local region may help connect pixels composed of similar materials but with varying illumination (in and out of shadow). III. NEW METHODS FOR HSI GRAPH CONSTRUCTION In this section, we describe several new spectral-density based graph construction techniques stemming from algorithms in the data mining literature. Any of the spatial weighting techniques discussed in Section II-F may also be applied along with the technique to generate spatial/spectral variants. A. Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) Graphs The SNN similarity introduced by Jarvis and Patrick [30] is based on the premise that similar nodes should have overlapping neighborhoods. Hence the similarity of two nodes, as measured by some primary similarity measure, is reinforced, or confirmed, by the presence of common (shared) neighbors. SNN is a nonlinear technique that can be very effective in the presence of clusters not well modeled by symmetric parametric distributions due to its ability to find regions of varying shape and density [30], and is widely used in the data mining community [31]. The strength of the similarity between two nodes may therefore be recast in terms of the number of shared neighbors, i.e., the higher the number of shared neighbors, the more similar the nodes. Given a vertex set V consisting of G =\\n|| vertices and a neighborhood size k, where 8 m, let the k \\nneighborhood set of vertex i be represented as 9 , \\nand define the SNN similarity as the size of the neighborhood intersection between two nodes i and j (6). )()(),( jNNiNNjiSNN kk I= (6) Whereas the initial implementation of SNN used fixed neighborhood sets (constant k), we recognize asymmetric neighborhoods as simply a generalization resulting from the use of adaptive density-based methods. We therefore define the more general density-based adaptive SNN measure as ,)()(),( jNNiNNjiSNN kjki I= (7) where ki and kj are the size of the neighborhoods generated for vertices i and j respectively from any of the density-based node-connectivity techniques from Section II. A SNN cosine similarity [32] may also be defined and is given by ,\\n),( ),cos(\\nkjki jiSNN kjki IVIV\\njiSNN ji \\n= \\n= (8) where IVv is the edge indicator vector for node v and ki, kj, and o , are as defined in (6) and (7). \\nFrom an imaging spectroscopy perspective, whereas symmetric globular clusters may exist in isolated regions of uniform material type, the presence of significant mixing can result in asymmetrically extended non-globular regions in hyperspace rendering description by parametric forms difficult; hence the need to explore methods invariant to cluster shape. The concept of overlapping neighborhood counts was first \\nFig. 4. Locally weighted nearest neighbors connects a pixel with seven global and two local neighbors [13]. This construct reinforces the spatial coherence found in imagery while permitting global connection to the most similar pixels.

Case Number 16-3868 \\n 8 used in HSI graph construction by Fan and Messinger [25] to modify the strength of a Gaussian-diffusion spectral similarity measure derived from Euclidean distance (Section II-F). This treatment differs in that the spectral similarity is based entirely on SNN counts and variations thereof. Creation of the SNN graph is conceptually simple, but more computationally expensive than the methods discussed thus far due to intersection of nearest neighbor sets for counting shared neighbors. The SNN similarity is therefore a secondary metric generated from a primary distance (or similarity) metric. The steps required to generate a SNN graph based on the SNN similarity are given below. 1) Compute the pairwise (dis)similarity matrix A primary distance (similarity) measure is used to define initial edges. 2) Construct a mutual k-NN graph Mutuality is imposed to avoid edges crossing regions of differing density (cf. Section II-B) and decrease computation time through a reduction in the number of required set intersections. 3) Redefine edge weights with the SNN (secondary) metric \\nThe number of neighbors shared by the two nodes becomes the new edge weight, replacing the (dis)similarity score from the primary metric.
