These requirements include visualization and modification of \\nTBFM adaptation elements as well as the underlying TBFM configuration parameters that are commonly \\nmodified when adapting a TBFM site. Modeling & Simulation \\nThe modeling and simulation requirements focus on the key areas identified in the needs analysis related to \\nthe evaluation of candidate operational scenarios to gain insight into the operational performance of design \\nchanges. These requirements focus on functional areas including scenario generation, scheduling, and \\ntrajectory modeling. Analysis & Reporting \\nThe analysis and reporting requirements focus on the key areas identified in the needs analysis related to the \\nperformance evaluation of generated scenarios. Additionally, reporting requirements are included for \\nsupporting the TBFM adaptation file modifications workflows needed to prepare adaptation for use in the \\noperational TBFM system. A. Functional Components \\nThe proposed capability consists of three main components adaptation data model with associated parsers, aircraft trajectory modeling (i.e., route analyzer / trajectory synthesizer), and the scheduler. These components \\nenable the four main functions of the capability adaptation visualization and modification, scenario generation, \\nscheduling, and metrics generation. Table 1 describes the mapping between the requirement categories, the \\nprototype components, and the prototype functions. Table 1. Mapping between Requirements, Components, and Prototype Functions. Requirement Category Components Functions Adaptation Visualization & \\nModification Data Model & Parsers Adaptation Visualization & \\nModification Modeling & Simulation Route Analyzer & Trajectory \\nSynthesizer Scenario Generation Scheduler Scheduler Analysis & Reporting Metrics Generation American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 9 B. Software Architecture \\nA modular software architecture was created to organize the capabilitys functionality into reusable blocks with clear responsibilities. The foundation of the prototype is a data model to describe the key logical elements of a \\nTBFM adaptation. A separate module was developed to parse the text data files and create the objects described in \\nthe data model informed by specific adaptation data. To simulate TBFM functions, separate modules were created \\nfor the trajectory modeling and scheduling functions. Finally, user interfaces were built on top of these foundational \\ncomponents to enable the functions which begin to satisfy the identified requirements. This modular approach enables future research to use some or all the components as needed, as well as \\nfacilitating subsequent replacement or independent improvement of the individual capabilities. Figure 5 provides a \\nhigh-level overview of the flow of information through the integrated design capability and the components which \\nsupport the primary functions. \\nFigure 5. Overview of Prototype Functions & Components. C. TBFM Adaptation Data Model \\n A key function of the integrated TBFM design capability is the ability to view and evaluate an existing TBFM \\nadaptation. The existing TBFM adaptation data consists of a set of text files organized in a complex structure with \\nmany interdependencies between the different files. Because no existing tools were found that can extract the data \\nfrom the TBFM adaptation file structure, the initial work focused on this area. A data model was implemented as a Java software library to describe the components of a TBFM adaptation. \\nAlong with the data model, a set of parsers was created to build that data model from standard text files in a TBFM \\nadaptation. The data model is the set of concepts and objects that are described by the data in the TBFM adaptation, \\nand how those objects relate to each other. With a defined data model, other software that uses TBFM data can be \\nmore easily be written. That data model can be populated with data read from disk or constructed on the fly. The \\nelements of the data model can be altered by software to produce hypothetical changes to a TBFM adaptation without \\nneeding to modify the adaptation files. The scope of the data model and parser components was, for initial efforts, limited to process only a subset of all \\nTBFM adaptation parameters. The focus of the research thus far has been to support simulation and modeling of \\nTBFM adapted routes, scheduling parameters (e.g., super stream and wake vortex separation requirements) and TBFM \\nconfiguration data to best emulate the operational TBFM system as part of the design environment. Therefore, the \\nrange of supported data elements and parsed files includes the set needed to support those capabilities. A sample subset \\nof the resulting internal TBFM adaptation data model is shown in Figure 6. These elements are shown for illustration \\npurposes only as well as to demonstrate how the TBFM adaptation text file structure was translated into a relational American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 10 software data model. The actual model used contains significantly more elements, as such its entirety could not be \\nincluded in this paper. \\nFigure 6. Example TBFM Data Model Elements. (Subset) D. Visualization and Editing \\nOnce the underlying TBFM adaptation data can parsed and made available as part of a software data model, the focus of the research shifted to adding functionality to visualize and modify the data. Since TARGETS is an existing \\ncapability commonly used for procedure development (see Section II. B.), the decision was made to add a plugin to \\nTARGETS to enable the visualization and evaluation of TBFM Adaptation in support of this research. TARGETS is \\nan FAA Enterprise capability in use by FAA facilities and industry partners to perform a wide variety of design and \\nanalysis activities. The software architecture of TARGETS provides a plugin model where additional capabilities can \\nbe added to TARGETS dynamically. The software prototype, described herein, included the development of a \\nTARGETS plugin which leverages the parsing, data modeling, and modeled TBFM scheduling functions. These \\ncapabilities also exist on their own and could be integrated into tools other than TARGETS. However, TARGETS \\nlarge user community and existing infrastructure makes it an appealing first integration goal for a research software \\ncapability. Figure 7 depicts the TARGETS plan view after importing TBFM adaptation at Albuquerque ARTCC and \\nPhoenix International Airport (PHX). Several of the key elements described in a TBFM adaptation can be \\nrepresented in a map view. This enables users to quickly visualize the placement of TBFM adaptation elements such \\nas arcs, freeze horizons, waypoints, and route segments which can highlight different issues with the underlying \\nadaptation data. However, there are many additional critical properties, values, and relationships in the TBFM data \\nthat are not easily visualized in a map view. An example is the weighting terms used to decide between runways, or \\nthe separation matrix data associated with a flow. The applications we envision for the integrated design capability \\noften require a user to iterate on, or at least interrogate, the data model to learn about some of these parameters \\nduring an experiment. Therefore, the prototype also includes several graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to allow the \\nuser to drill down into the TBFM data and examine, and in many cases change, the parameters of various elements \\nand functions. American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 11 \\nFigure 7. TARGETS prototype with visualized TBFM adaptation E. Trajectory Modeling \\nTBFM performs decision support functions using controlled airspace adaptation and the modeling of aircraft located in that volume. Two of the key functions in that modeling process are the Route Analyzer (RA) and Trajectory \\nSynthesizer (TS) [5]. These components are required to be emulated because they enable scenario generation \\ncapabilities to help evaluate how aircraft are expected to operate when flying along TBFM adapted routes. The RA is responsible for evaluating an aircrafts intended path and trajectory based on properties like the aircraft \\ntype, the filed flight plan, the aircrafts current position, altitude, and speed. The evaluation results are an enumeration \\nof the possible paths that the aircraft may be directed to take to an active runway at the arrival airport. Some airport \\nconfigurations and route definitions can offer several options for an aircraft. These different route options are passed \\nto the second module, the TS, which is used to execute a simulation of the aircrafts performance along each route. \\nThis simulation produces ETAs at various key points along the route, including outer arc crossings, meter fix \\ncrossings, final approach fix (FAF) crossings, and arrival at the runway threshold. In operational TBFM applications, RA and TS are functions are part of the TBFM architecture. The integrated \\ndesign capability developed in this research is independent from any production TBFM source code or deployed \\nfunctionality. Instead, simplified models of TBFMs functions were built using the data model discussed in previous \\nsections. The simplified RA used data elements from the adaptation data model to inform several aspects of its operation. \\nThis included the specification of various speed and altitude constraints along various routes. The starting point for \\nthe modeled RA was an aircraft from a scenario (discussed in section V.G). An aircraft was specified by an en route \\nprocedure segment, an aircraft identifier, an engine type, a wake vortex category, and a set of initial conditions. The \\nprocedure segment that was associated with the aircraft was one that had been defined in the TBFM adaptation data \\nand truncated at a meter fix. Any data along the procedure segment after the meter fix was discarded. Given",
