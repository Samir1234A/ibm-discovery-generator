  "text": "well as concept evaluations prior to this\\nsimulation. Three main features were added for IM: an IM clearance window, aircraft role in and status of\\nIM in the aircraft data block, and a slot marker color change. This section will provide\\nintroductory / background information and then review the specific features. IM states were shown in previous simulations, though not all the states were the same (e.g.,\\nAligne et al., 2003; Benson et al., 2011; Baxley et al., 2016). For this simulation, the following\\nstates were defined from a ground system perspective and were relevant to the IM interface: Pre-initiation: Automation is evaluating pairs of aircraft for IM. Eligible pairs are\\npresented to the controller as an IM operation proposal. Initiation: Automation has proposed the IM clearance to the controller but the IM\\noperation has not been started. Conduct: IM proposal has been accepted by the controller and is active if the controller\\nissued the clearance and the flight crew engaged IM. Suspension: IM operation is temporarily inactive. Termination: IM operation is inactive.\\nEach of the states can have sub-states related to the validity and feasibility of the operation (as\\nshown in Figure 3-23). Transitions between states were either through controller or automation\\naction. See Appendix A for further information on the validity and feasibility checks. Controller\\ninputs to change states are shown in Table 3-1. 3-23 Figure 3-23.

Validity checks were made to determine whether the criteria for initiating IM\\nwere met. If any of the validity check failed, the clearance was not proposed to the controller.\\nFeasibility checks were also conducted prior to proposing and during any eligible IM clearance\\nproposal. Feasibility checks determined whether the IM operation could achieve the ASG with\\nspeed alone (the equivalent of the TSAS early / late indicator). If any of the feasibility checks\\nfailed, that information was presented to the controller in the status field as Eligible No\\nSpeed. In order to overcome the feasibility issue, the controller needed to provide a vector or\\nspeed greater or less than that IM would provide (i.e., greater or less than 15% of the profile\\nspeed). Feasibility checks were also conducted during the suspended and terminated states\\n(see Appendix A). 3.1.3.3.1 IM Clearance Window\\nBased on past work, it was determined that an IM clearance window should be used to provide\\ninformation that the controller would communicate as part of the IM clearance. The STARS\\ndisplay did not have a metering list to integrate the IM information into, so one had to be\\ndeveloped. It was determined that the clearance window should also show the status of the clearance\\ninformation (e.g., a proposed IM clearance versus an active IM operation). The information\\nprovided in the IM clearance window is expected to support that shown in the data block. Such\\ninformation may be necessary if not all states are shown in the data block (e.g., suspension or\\ninvalid) or may be necessary to specify that status of each pair in the list so data blocks do not\\nneed to be cross referenced. Four of the five defined states were shown to the controller. Pre-initiation and initiation were\\ncombined and labeled as Eligible. Conduct was labeled as Active. Suspension and\\ntermination were labeled as Suspended and Terminated respectively. If the clearance was determined to be valid and feasible, the clearance information and an\\nEligible status was provided in the IM clearance window to the controller with the trail\\naircraft. The information in the IM clearance window was only shown to the controller with the\\ntrail aircraft, whether or not that controller also had the lead aircraft. The clearance could be\\naccepted or rejected by the controller. If the clearance was rejected, the Status field changed to\\nRejected. The text remained for 30 seconds prior to the full IM clearance proposal being 3-25 removed. This delay allowed for awareness of the rejected operation and to allow for re-\\nactivation if the rejection was in error. If an operation had been rejected, it was not proposed\\nagain to the same controller / sector. However, it was proposed to the final controller. The\\nsame held true for terminated operations. If the clearance was accepted, instead of rejected,\\nthe status field changed to Active. The order of the IM clearances in the IM clearance window were based on the runway\\nsequence. This means a new proposal did not always appear at the top of the list but could\\nappear somewhere further down the list based on the lead aircraft sequence number for the\\nrunway. This order was consistent with the order of the TSAS timeline. The text in the window was color-coded to indicate different statuses (shown in Figure 3-24 and\\nsummarize with other information in Table 3-2 at the end of this section). White text indicated\\nan action was possible (i.e., activation possible). The white text status states were one of the\\nfollowing: Eligible, Eligible No Speed, or Suspended. Green text indicated an IM\\noperation had been accepted by the controller. The status state was Active. Yellow text\\nindicated an action was required (i.e., termination or a maneuver). The yellow text status states\\nwere one of the following: Active Invalid, Active No Speed, Suspended Invalid,\\nSuspended No Speed, or Terminated, Terminated Invalid, or Terminated No\\nSpeed. Dark gray text indicated the information was going to be removed (based the proposal\\nbeing inactive). The dark gray status state was Rejected. Note that the Terminated status\\nwas intended to be dark gray instead of yellow but the mismatch was not detected in time to\\ncorrect the error before data collection. Figure 3-24.

Fields of note will be\\nreviewed next. The clearance types used in the simulation were achieve-by then maintain and capture then\\nmaintain. They were abbreviated as Achieve and Capture for brevity in the display and\\nwhen issuing the clearance over the voice frequency. The ASG in the spacing goal field, was\\ncalculated by TBFM and was the trail aircraft STA at the ABP minus the lead aircraft STA at the\\nABP. The ASG had an IM aware buffer reduction of 0.1 NM based on the expected low\\nspacing variance provided by IM (as compared to metering only operations). The ASG was\\npresented with a 1-second resolution. Next to the ASG was a spacing prediction value in parentheses (shown in some scenarios).\\nBenson et al. (2011) and Aligne et al. (2003) reported that controllers found the predicted\\ninterval at the ABP to be useful. It may become more critical as the ABP is close to or within a\\ncontrollers airspace, as was the case for this simulation. Peterson et al. (2012) also reported\\ncontrollers finding it useful to having delay information. However, only a slight majority of\\ncontrollers reported that the MTE was useful for maintaining awareness of IM operations. Since\\nthis information is not available in the TRACON with TSAS, it was added with the granularity\\nreduced to second (from a minute shown in en route). For achieve operations, the difference\\nbetween the TSAS-calculated trail aircraft ETA at the ABP and the lead aircraft ETA at the ABP\\nvalue was shown. For capture operations, the difference between the TSAS-calculated trail\\naircraft ETA at the FAF and the lead aircraft ETA at the FAF value was shown. These values were\\nprovided to allow the controllers to compare the spacing estimated by TBFM / TSAS (ETA\\ndifferential / prediction) to the ASG and to determine how the operation was progressing. After the lead aircraft identification in the lead aircraft field, the sector of the lead aircraft was\\nincluded if both aircraft were not in the same sector (in case coordination between the\\ncontrollers was necessary). The ABP was either DERVL (the merge point) or YOKXO (the FAF and\\nRNP RF turn final approach intercept) (later shown in Figure 3-32). The lead aircraft route was\\nthe IFPI of the lead aircraft. If it was a capture operation, the lead aircraft route was not shown\\nsince it is a requirement that both aircraft be on the same route to conduct",
