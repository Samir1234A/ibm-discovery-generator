Public Release Case Number 18-4487 Fighting Polio in Africa, Thanks to MITRE's Civic Leave Program As a group leader in the International Operations Department, Melissa Utzinger travels the globe helping \\nforeign governments overcome engineering issues. Her typical challenge involves providing rigorous \\nengineering analysis to inform key decision making of partner nations and the U.S. Their goal: to develop \\nan integrated, cohesive system that gets the job done. But recently, she was overseas to tackle a much \\ndifferent challengehow to administer a polio vaccine to a child under five years old. I was a little nervous about it because I dont have a medical background, but fortunately it was drops \\nand not an injection, she says. And I brought boxes of raisins and gave one to every kid after they got \\ntwo drops under their tongue. Pretty soon, the adults were encouraging more kids to do it, so they could \\nget raisins too. Utzinger joined a humanitarian mission sponsored by Rotary International in Benin, a tiny sliver of a \\ncountry on the border of Nigeria in West Africa. Rotary is a founding partner of the Global Polio \\nEradication Initiative, which has immunized more than 2.5 billion children against the disease in 122 \\ncountries. And despite Utzinger's busy work schedule, MITRE not only supported her desire to help others, but also \\nprovided paid time off through our civic leave program. Working for the Health of Childrenand Trees Using her 40 hours of paid volunteer service time, Utzinger flew into the capital city of Cotonou on \\nOctober 2 and spent part of the next week vaccinating the people most vulnerable to this deadly \\ninfectious disease. By the end of her stay, the Rotary volunteers had provided inoculations to more than \\n200 children. The volunteers met in the mornings at a health center where local mothers and children were already \\nlined up to receive the vaccinations. People got so dressed up to come, she says. You could tell it was \\nan important event for them. In the afternoons, Utzinger and her teammates went door-to-door in the neighboring slums. Each person \\nhad a distinct job: locate eligible children, maintain a wearable freezer compartment to keep the \\nvaccines cold, administer the vaccines, and place a mark on each childs left pinky to identify those who \\nreceived inoculations. Team members made their way through the streets, leaving chalk marks on each house to indicate how \\nmany children lived in each one and how many had been inoculated. If they missed any children the first \\ntime around, the team stopped in again on the way home to try and find them. As part of the mission, Rotary International gave each participant a day away from the inoculation work \\nto pursue other volunteer work. Utzinger opted to spend her day planting trees outside the city. She \\nplanted a variety of fast-growing saplings, some for firewood and some with medicinal purposes, such as \\npain relief. Copyright \\nApproved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-4487 Back in her office in Bedford, Massachusetts, Utzinger has been working on a project to help a partner \\nnation integrate their missile defense capabilities into its overall defense architecture while enhancing \\ncoalition, U.S., and regional security capabilities. But the lessons from Benin are never far from her mind. The experience really gave me a better perspective on life here, she says. You realize how fortunate \\nwe are here to have something as basic as clean running waterand you realize how important it is to \\nreach out and help other people. What Is MITRE's Civic Leave Program? The civic leave program offers MITRE employees up to 40 hours of paid time each year for volunteering \\non civic and community projects. It's been around for decades and is extremely popular, says Sue \\nStapleton, who runs the program. In 2018, about 1,300 employees applied for it. The projects include international work, such as providing public health education on HIV in India and \\nconstructing orphanages in the Dominican Republic. Closer to home, the program covers work in \\nfoodbanks, STEM mentoring and outreach, hurricane relief, and work with veterans and senior citizens. \\nRequests must be approved by the appropriate manager. The civic leave program really underscores how important working in the public good is here at MITRE, \\nStapleton says. As a company, our commitment doesnt end with the work day. We really want to \\nsupport our employees in giving back to their communities in their personal lives as well. --by Twig Mowatt PHOTO: _top\\n _Hlk531610489\\n _GoBack \",",
