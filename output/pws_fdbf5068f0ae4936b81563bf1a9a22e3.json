McLean, VA Center for Advanced Aviation System Development ii Abstract\\nThis paper presents the concept of operations (ConOps) and the results of a Human-In-The-Loop \\n(HITL) simulation for the Time Based Management Required Time of Arrival (TBM-RTA) \\nconcept. This concept leverages the Required Time of Arrival capability that is available in many \\nFlight Management Systems (FMS). Under the TBM-RTA concept, controllers can issue \\nequipped aircraft an RTA to a fix, which pilots enter into the FMS. The aircrafts speed is then \\nadjusted by the FMS such that it meets the RTA. Additionally, if the RTA time is found to \\nexceed the speed envelope of the aircraft, the concept included using a Path Stretch Advisory \\nfunction which allowed controllers to assign an automation-provided Path Stretch solution along \\nwith an RTA. The Path Stretch maneuver reroutes the aircraft off the current route to a specified \\npoint, which is represented as a radial and nautical miles distance from the rejoin fix. Results \\nfrom the evaluation showed that the concept is operationally acceptable for pilots and controllers. \\nMoreover, RTA-operated flights showed lower cancellation rates and higher delivery accuracy at \\nthe meter point with smaller speed adjustments when compared to non-RTA flights. Based on \\nthese results, MITRE believes that the TBM-RTA concept has potential to move operations \\ncloser to Trajectory-Based Operations (TBO). iii Table of Contents\\nAbstract \\n1 Introduction \\n2 Concept of Operations for TBM-RTA \\n3 Part-Task Human in the Loop Simulation \\n3.2 High-Fidelity FMS Flight Simulators \\n3.3 Core TBM-RTA Software Functions \\n3.4 Operational Scenario \\n3.5 Evaluation Phraseology \\n3.6 Traffic Scenarios \\n4.1 Summary of HITL Flights \\n4.2 Operational Acceptability \\n4.3 Reasons for Canceled RTAs \\n4.4 RTA Flights Metering Delivery Accuracy \\n4.5 Aircraft Separation at Meter Fix Crossing \\n4.6 RTA Flights Speed Profile Data \\n4.7 Controller and Pilot Feedback \\n4.7.2 Controllers Qualitative Results \\n4.7.2.2 Comments on the Integrated ConOps \\n4.7.2.3 General TBM Comments \\n4.9 Pilots Qualitative Results \\n6 Next Steps \\n7 Acknowledgments \\n8 References \\nAppendix A Acronyms \\nFigure 1.

FMS RTA Flights Summary \\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is implementing new automation capabilities, which \\nleverage investments made by both the FAA and Operators in Performance-Based Navigation \\n(PBN) and other flight deck capabilities; this will help transform the National Airspace System \\n(NAS) to Trajectory Based Operations (TBO) which is part of the Next Generation Air \\nTransportation System (NextGen) program. TBO is an air traffic management (ATM) method for \\nstrategically planning, managing, and optimizing flights by using time-based management \\n(TBM), information exchange between air and ground systems, and the aircrafts ability to fly \\nprecise paths. Expected benefits of TBO include enhanced flight efficiency, maximized airspace \\nand airport throughput, improved operational predictability, and increased operational flexibility. \\nThe successful operational transition to TBO relies in part on effective TBM, and for some origin-\\ndestination pairs, gate-to-gate TBM. TBM uses time to efficiently integrate traffic demand for \\nconstrained NAS resources; this goal is accomplished by use of automation to generate a \\nschedule at designated points of interest, which consists of flight-specific crossing times to \\nachieve the appropriate spacing interval. Effective TBM depends on accurate predictions by \\nautomation of expected flight crossing times and accurate calculation of a schedule, as well as the \\nuse of decision support tools (DSTs) by controllers and traffic managers to help meet the \\nschedule (e.g., meet time advisories) and modify it as schedule disruptions occur. \\nThe FAA has deployed numerous PBN procedures and routes throughout the NAS, and airspace \\nusers have started to realize benefits. However, the full set of PBN benefits will only be realized \\nwith TBOrequiring full integration between aircraft PBN capability, aircraft flight \\nmanagement capabilities, and air traffic strategic planning and TBM. TBM, also referred to as \\nmetering, is largely provided via the Time-Based Flow Management (TBFM) ground-based \\nsystem which is used to manage traffic to/from several airports today. Additionally, several \\nTBFM scheduling enhancements, such as Coupled Scheduling and Extended Metering \\nfunctionality, and new DSTs, that provide automated speed advisories and path change advisories \\nfor controllers, are in the process of implementation or planned for use across ATC domains [1]. \\nThese enhancements and tools will help controllers better manage flights to meet the \\ndesired/scheduled crossing times (i.e., aircraft delivery) at designated points (e.g., metering arcs, \\narrival fixes) along arrival routes and procedures. Moreover, some existing flight-deck \\ncapabilities can further improve upon the accuracy and efficiency by which those crossing times \\nare met. \\nThe most relevant of these existing flight deck capabilities, present in many aircraft Flight \\nManagement Systems (FMS), is the capability to accept an ATC-issued Required Time of \\nArrival (RTA) clearance to cross a given point in space at a specified time. The RTA clearance is \\nmet using real-time aircraft speed adjustments executed by the FMS. One advantage of using the \\nFMS to meet the time requirement is that the FMS can better account for wind and flight profile \\nuncertainties as compared with ground-based automation advisories. Moreover, the FMS RTA \\ncapability provides a tightly coupled closed-loop solution, updating its speed automatically to \\nadjust for forecast wind errors and unmodeled aircraft dynamics in order to meet the assigned \\nRTA. As a result, ATC does not need to frequently issue updated speed assignments to achieve \\nflight adjustments required to more accurately meet the metering crossing time target.\\nStakeholders have shown strong interest in using RTA-capable flights to achieve near-term TBM \\nobjectives [9]. The performance and behavior of airborne RTA has been extensively studied in \\nsimulations and operational trials [2], [3], [4] but not in the context of the FAAs envisioned ii TBO scope. Building on those previous studies, The MITRE Corporations Center for Advanced \\nAviation System Development (MITRE CAASD) performed analyses to develop and refine a \\nconcept for using RTA to more accurately meet a scheduled crossing time [6]. In this study, \\nMITRE simulated use of RTA in the context of a future en route TBM environment (consistent \\nwith initial TBO) that included TBM scheduling enhancements and DSTs that provided meet-\\ntime advisory options to aid controllers in managing flights to their scheduled crossing times in \\nan extended metering operation; the scope included Ground-based Interval Management-Spacing \\n(GIM-S) speed advisories [7] (currently available), the Delay Countdown Time (DCT) (currently \\navailable), and Path Stretch advisories [8] (a future capability). The proposed concept for \\nleveraging the aircraft RTA function is referred to in this paper as the TBM-RTA concept. iii Concept of Operations Summary for TBM-RTA2\\nAs indicated in Figure 1, the TBM-RTA concept combines the advanced arrival scheduling \\ncapabilities provided by the TBFM system and the aircraft FMS RTA function to enable \\nimproved delivery accuracy of multiple arrival streams to the terminal airspace boundary [1]. \\nCurrently, controllers issue speed and heading commands to pilots to meet the scheduled flight \\nspecific crossing times generated by the TBFM system. With the TBM-RTA concept, controllers \\nare envisioned as issuing an RTA clearance to the pilot using the TBFM generated Scheduled \\nTime of Arrival (STA) value (i.e., flight-specific crossing time) as the basis for the RTA; the \\npilot would input that value into the FMS and the avionics would adjust the aircraft speed to \\ncross the designated point at the STA. Figure 1. TBM-RTA Capabilities Overview The TBM-RTA operation is envisioned to be conducted in en route airspace only for meeting \\nSTAs at the Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) boundary Meter Fix (MF) or a \\nCoupled/Extended Meter Point (MP). The TBM-RTA operation begins when an aircraft crosses \\nthe respective en route TBFM scheduling Freeze Horizon (FH) and the TBFM system assigns an \\nSTA for a Meter Reference Point (MRP) of interest (which can be a MF or a MP). The relevant \\nMRP schedule information is directly available on the situation display for en route controllers \\nwho issue the arrival procedure to aircraft along with specific instructions for aircraft to meet \\nassigned STAs at the associated MRPs. The meet-time advisory options for each flight are \\nindicated (and can be accepted or rejected by the controller) both in the MRP list and in the flight \\ndatablock.\\nUnder the TBM-RTA concept,",
