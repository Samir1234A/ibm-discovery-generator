  "sdl_extracted_summary": "policy recommendations and voluntary corrective actions or mitigations. In the aviation model, CAST is the public-private partnership, and the ASIAS program is the neutral third-party analytical support. The success of this model hinges on a shared trust between all of the parties involved. In this model, the ability of the neutral third party to steward data in a manner that shields it from regulatory inspection and public access granted via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) enables industry partners trust. The industry agreement to provide industry perspectives and participate in consensus decisions is also a critical element of this models success. The contributions the parties make (also labeled in Figure 5-1) consist of the industry membership providing operational data and individuals confidential reports. While optional for the success of the program, the CAST model enables industry partners direct access to specifically approved benchmarks (shown as the dashed line in Figure 5-1). The regulators provide government-collected data and direction in the form of safety-related research needs. Also, in this model, the regulators provide funding to the neutral third party for their analytical services, although other structures could likely be as successful. Finally, the consensus decision- making group contributes goals and requirements to the analytical third party and in return receives alerts, metrics, trends, and precursors. The neutral third party does not identify and communicate mitigations, however. Consensus decisions in the Public-Private Partnership develop the identification and communication of mitigations. Figure 5-1. Structure for a Public-Private Partnership for Safety 5-2 Four high-level stages are necessary to enable a successful partnership, which is as follows: Identify Barriers: Determine laws and policies that prevent non-punitive reporting of incidents (free of disciplinary actions), and get buy-in from legal and operational personnel. Decisions on how culpability is handled, are required. Develop Policies: Develop confidential reporting procedures and structures to enable de- identification/protection from FOIA and other legal proceedings. Remove barriers to make reporting easy, determining what is mandatory, what is voluntary, whether follow- up interviews are allowed, etc. Specify Actions: Define specific roles and responsibilities for implementing and maintaining a safety culture. Establish governance for handling sensitive data, and the design, training, and usage of reporting forms and data repository systems. Analyze and Implement: Build data analytics and information-sharing methods. Educate stakeholders about lessons learned. Implement learning into decision-making and policy. Continue to measure safety improvements. The development of a successful partnership requires investment by all parties within industry organizations, and by the government regulator. The efforts are not without cost, but the cost is far less than those related to fatal accidents. In a successful partnership, each industry member: Implements SMS (or an analogous structured, formalized safety management process) \\nused to identify and control risks; Captures safety-related data from automated sensor technology; Institutes a confidential safety hazard reporting system; Fosters a positive, non-punitive safety culture; and Develops capacity for data capture and transmission to enable data fusion, mining, and \\nanalytics. In parallel, the government regulator enables an equal partnership role specifically for improving safety. A public-private partnership features industry forums to share safety information collaboratively, form agreements on common statements of fact and implement mitigations. The underlying ingredient in the above elements is the level of trust between the regulator and the regulated, and the general industry attitude toward sharing information among industry organizations for a shared benefit. The maturity of the partnership is not developed instantaneously but rather evolves over time with trust. 6-1 6 Potential for Collaborative Partnership in the U.S. Rail Sector \\nAviation and rail operating structures have many similarities due to their overall mission of providing long-distance transportation. Rail and air vehicles travel along strictly defined networks between terminal areas or transfer points while maintaining vehicle-to-vehicle separation distances for efficiency and safety. Both systems employ analogous centralized traffic control regimes communicating to vehicles operated by multi-person crews. Commercial air traffic flow is under positive control, a method that continuously tracks and collectively directs vehicle movements to ensure safe separation in three dimensions. Railroads employ a two- dimensional block-occupancy control model. Rights-of-way divide into discrete segments, and vehicle performance, track geometry, and the location of preceding trains governs train movements between blocks. The North American railroad and airline industries each have a small number of major business entities formed by a flurry of mergers and acquisitions, supported by many smaller service entities. These similarities encourage us to examine other similarities that motivate or show evidence of a collaborative partnership in the rail sector. The rail sector, like aviation, maintains a strong commitment to safety and has experienced a steady decline in fatal accident rates despite periods of rising and falling demand. Both industries monitor and manage accident causes, and in the case of rail, derailment rates have not risen [34]. From 1975 to 2010, per capita fatality risk (i.e., the probability that any one member of society dies on the associated mode) has declined by roughly two-thirds in railroading and by four-fifths in aviation [35]. The rail industrys workplace fatality rate is equal to that of aviation, at 0.06 per 1000 workers [35]. Despite these statistics, the FRA and major representative industry organizations including the Association of American Railroads (AAR) and the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association (ASLRRA) remain unsatisfied with the current record [36] [37] [38]. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (RSIA [2008]) and recent accidents are large motivational forces behind improving safety. Railroads in the United Kingdom (UK), across the European Union, in Australia, and in North America apply SMS. Because the rail networks intermix, policy-making activities across North America have strong implications for the U.S. rail sector. In Canada, the 1999 amendment to the Rail Safety Act of 1985 required railroads to implement SMS and move away from a compliance-based approach. The purpose of this amendment was to foster success that depended on a partnership between industry and regulator and that railroads would benefit from an increased competitive advantage, reduced regulatory oversight, and improved relationships, partnerships, and collaboration. [39]. However, a 2007 Rail Safety Act Review panel and a more recent review following the high-profile accident in 2013 in Lac-Mgantic, Quebec revealed that railroads lacked implementation consistency and expressed skepticism about the regulators intentions [39] [40]. As with aviation, railroads have been increasingly applying technology across all aspects of the industry. Technology uptake in rail takes longer than in aviation due to much longer life cycles that enable much older rolling stock and locomotives to continue easily operating in the system. Focused research has revealed that track or wheel defects contribute greatly to accidents and derailments [34]. Currently, the major Class I railroads are investing in innovative efforts to capture safety data relating to the dynamics of infrastructure and rolling stock through an array of advanced trackside sensors [41] and via unmanned aircraft systems [42] to predict failures and causal factors. The massive development efforts involved in PTC are designed to intervene in operations to control operational risks and address human errors. With the rapid expansion of 6-2 sensor technology usage, the potential for a secondary use of this inspection data and those required to support PTC implementation and operations creates an opportunity for further safety benefits. As PTC is rolled out in the system, collected data could be used to analyze not just PTC events, but also to frame the environmental conditions associated with accidents, incidents, or contributory factors. Analogous to aviation near midair collisions, PTC intervention events can provide information into what could be happening that leads up to potential derailments or collisions. Developed in parallel to the CAST public-private partnership, the UKs Confidential Information Reporting and Analysis System (CIRAS) model borrowed from past experiences of confidential reporting in aviation. CIRAS addresses what had been identified as a lack of adequate feedback for incident reporting. Efforts to develop CIRAS began in 1995 as a result of a report regarding the under-reporting of safety-related incidents by ScotRail employees due to the blame culture perceived at that time [43]. Soon after CIRAS produced promising results at ScotRail, many other railways in the UK joined the program. In 1999, the decision to mandate the program nationally followed a high-profile accident in central London that shook public confidence [44]. In the U.S., following a House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee report in 2007 that revealed rail safety reporting issues [45], the FRA began a pilot program. This program involves collaborating with the DOT and NASA to develop a system, equivalent to ASRS, for railroad safety. It was entitled the C3RS, as mentioned in Section 3. Piloted by seven passenger railroads (AMTRAK and those around the Boston, New York, and Chicago metropolitan areas), the FRA demonstration project was intended to improve railroad safety by allowing railroad companies to report close calls without being penalized by FRA. By design, before inclusion into the database, reports were de-identified and then reviewed for completeness. Successful initial results indicate that the program is expanding after lessons learned are incorporated [46]. For instance, the committee found that limitations with the effectiveness of the C3RS",

For Teamwork, an Innovative Space Inspires Collaboration Anywhere Cutting across both geographic and generational boundaries, MITREs \\nCollaboration Spaces initiative empowers a diverse and far-flung workforce to \\nspeak, brainstorm, and get on the same pagewithout having to be in the same \\nroom. Some people conduct business the traditional wayin their offices at their companys headquarters. \\nOthers work remotely. Seasoned veterans are used to conference rooms, where one person talks and \\neveryone else listens. Meanwhile, twentysomethings who grew up in a more interactive world, think \\nnothing of sneaking peeks at their laptops or wireless devices during meetings. Workforces are trying to reconcile these conflicting technological and demographic trends, but at MITRE, \\nstriking the right balance is particularly important. In the words of MITREs Doug Phair, From what Ive \\nobserved, external companies are seen as hired hands brought in to execute something. But were seen \\nas part of the team. Were tied to our federal government sponsors at the ground level, at the very \\nbeginning of projects, as a trusted adviser. That means we must foster an environment in which employees and our partners in the federal \\ngovernment, industry, and academia can work together and share knowledge freely, no matter where \\nthey are. Innovative ways to collaborate are nothing new at MITRE, but the Collaborative Spaces project \\ntakes it to a new level. With Collaborative Spaces, teams don't just meetthey create. Collaborative Spaces was born from the premise of space to attract and retain folks, plus space to \\nconnect MITRE together to do brainstorming and project war room-type stuff, says Phair, who led the \\nMITRE team that developed Collaborative Spaces. That was the transformation we helped push over \\nthe past few years. One Generation Learns from Another Building on the work of MITREs Enterprise Computing, Information, and Security Innovation Program \\n(which provides funding to employees to explore ideas for innovative projects), Phair formed a team that \\nexamined how MITRE could modernize its workspaceschanging them from briefing rooms to war \\nrooms. Achieving that goal required thoughtful redesign. The team drew on a wide range of \\nexpertisehuman resources, information technology, and corporate real estate. But the most valuable feedback of all may have come from the usability studies that involved \\nemployeesincluding the next generation. One summer, Phair put up a time-lapse camera in the Collaborative Systems Lab, located on MITREs \\nBedford, MA. campus. There were chairs, couches, movable tables, and whiteboards stacked in a corner \\nof the lab. Phair told a group of 12 co-ops to make the space into whatever they wanted. The only \\ncondition? They had to keep a journal and make an entry whenever they changed something. It was an educational experience all around. The co-ops quickly abandoned the desks in favor of the \\ncouches. They moved the collaborative whiteboards out of the way because they were blocking the https://www.mitre.org/careers/working-at-mitre/employee-voices/a-technology-evangelist-brings-the-future-into-mitres\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/publications/project-stories/a-new-tool-for-gaining-an-edge-in-high-tech-brainstorming\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/careers/student-programs/co-ops-interns sunlight. And they bridged generational gaps when it came to practices like bringing laptops and \\nchecking them during meetings. Im a Baby Boomer, and I tend to see people in a meeting with a laptop as not paying attention, Phair \\nsays. But it has become clear that early career staff coming in see it as an efficiency. They were getting \\nanswers before they left the meeting. Working together, with multiple generations in one space, was a \\nlearning experience, and we got to understand each other. \\\"Its that compromise, that push-pull, that seems to make things work. Meanwhile, the construction of a new building on MITREs McLean, Va., campusa three-year project \\ncompleted in 2016presented an opportunity to remake the workplace. The team took advantage of \\nideas prototyped with the innovation project and included lessons learned for the co-op lab study. The building has neighborhoods\\\"groupings of workspaces supporting working relationships within \\nand among groups of employeesthat includes spaces for collaboration, as well as spaces reserved for \\nmobile workers. And the policies governing the way those spaces are used emphasizes flexibilityfor \\nexample, by allowing employees to reserve collaboration rooms over a multi-day period, instead of one \\nhour. Flexible Work Spaces to Suit Every Work Style The result is a group of rooms that use commercially available technology in innovative ways to \\naccommodate just about anyones preferred work style. Things like size, seating capacity, and interactive \\ntechnologies define spaces. For example, \\\"huddle rooms\\\" allow small groups to gather quickly and conduct businessand group \\nmembers can call into the room if necessary. In a fully outfitted space called a \\\"project studio,\\\" they can \\npivot from presentations to brainstorming sessions. Participants can easily adjust the furniture to bring it \\nfrom table to standing height, making it easier to customize the brainstorming experience. Anyone can \\nuse several writeable surfaces (tables and a wall) for jotting down ideas. And in a \\\"collaboration cove,\\\" people can gather around a table with dual monitors and share \\ninformation and ideas with one another, including colleagues in remote locations. Participants can share \\ninformation and switch whos presenting seamlessly, saving them the time and trouble of an email \\nthread. We made sure that the space would meet all of those different needs, depending on what kind of work \\ngroup was in there, says Lorin Petersen, a MITRE senior software engineer who served on the \\nCollaborative Spaces design team. Maybe one group preferred to write everything down, while another \\ngroup preferred to do something digital on a laptop. They found out they could do that all within that \\nsame room. \\\"The goal is a project team working together in a unified space. Each team member can collaborate in \\nthe way that best suits their work style. Safe and Secure CollaborationRegardless of Location What if you can't meet with your team in person? Collaborative Spaces use technology to loop in people \\nwho cant physically make it to any of the rooms. An interactive projector powers a built-in virtual https://www.mitre.org/careers/student-programs/recent-graduates whiteboard you can connect to via laptops. Its touch-sensitive, so you can write on a projected image \\nwith a pen or your finger. And even if you're not physically present, you're still in. Staff in different \\nlocations can see everyone in the room, thanks to a 360-degree camera. You dont want to make it more difficult for people to get the work done,\\\" says Kristy Markin, a MITRE \\nuser information and information architect who worked on the design. \\\"But everyone knows how to pick \\nup a marker and go write on a whiteboard. Its a major advancement to have a projector thats precise \\nenough to allow people to write on it in a way that felt natural to them and have somebody else \\nremotely see that in real time.\\\" The technology behind the digital whiteboards is also more secure, thanks to MITREs inputand \\nconfidence in our role as a trusted adviser. We performed security evaluations of the electronic \\nwhiteboards in our Collaborative Systems Lab, discovered security vulnerabilities, and offered advice on \\nhow best to address them. Weve helped industry think about security issues and drive improvements, Phair says. These boards \\nwere never going to be used in a government installation until we did some of this work. For Phair, that exampleserving as a trusted partner and an early adapter and molder of new \\nideasunderscores MITREs approach to building the workplace of the future. Were willing to pilot and try new things to keep the culture of collaboration, but also support the new \\ndemographics of how we work and the distributive sense of our work. -- by Russell Woolard _top\\n _GoBack \",",
