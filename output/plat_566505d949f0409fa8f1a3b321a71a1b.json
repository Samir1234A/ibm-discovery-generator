[27] The underlying concept resembles the core of the current-day public-private partnership model, but the recommendation lacked a key ingredient trust. By insisting that airlines grant FAA direct access to airline computer management systems and penalizing non-reporting, the recommendation revealed the governments lack of trust for the industry and its need to assert authority over the industry. The mechanism for a collaborative safety process may have been prescribed, but without an investment in building trust as a foundation, the industry maintained its status quo for nearly another decade. As in the past, tragedy spawned action. During a period between July 1994 and July 1996, six high-profile major accidents occurred, resulting in 737 fatalities. Midway through this string of accidents, in January 1995, FAA held an industry-wide summit setting a goal of zero accidents through key areas, including safety, maintenance, and operational data collection and sharing. This decision later culminated in the Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP). ASAP was enabled through the agreement with airlines and pilots associations to begin the Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) program, which collects Flight Data Recorder data to analyze safety trends rather than conduct only post-incident investigations. It granted FAA access to the data, with pilot identities deleted. Following the ValuJet crash in the Florida Everglades in May 1996 and the midair explosion of TWA Flight 800 two months later, President Clinton announced the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security to review the state of aviation safety. The findings of the Commission challenged the government and industry to reduce the accident rate by 80 percent over ten years [2]. A Congressional commission, the National Civil Aviation Review Commission, followed up in December of 1996 with a recommendation that FAA and industry work together to develop a comprehensive, integrated safety plan to implement existing safety recommendations [28]. These government reports recognized that the forecasted air traffic demand would exceed the limitations of existing safety strategies. The FAA responded with an approach that was a radical departure from the typical model in which the industry was regulated from a position of authority. The decision to engage in collaborative efforts to develop mitigations provided the framework for the formation of a public-private partnership for aviation safety. 4-1 4 Ingredients for a Collaborative Partnership \\nFAA enabled the creation of a public-private partnership by separating the internal safety improvement organization from the regulatory organization. This separation permitted the safety improvement organization within FAA to create a partnership with industry based on equality. Formed in 1998 as the Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST), this unique group committed to working together to sift through large numbers of proposed safety improvements [29]. Their initial goal was to prioritize mitigations by impact, feasibility, and cost through consensus agreement. Rather than being forcibly required by regulatory compliance, implementation was voluntary. Examples include aircraft and avionics manufacturers committing to functionality improvements and airlines upgrading airframes and changing flight crew training [30]. Since its inception, participation in CAST grew to include virtually all government and industry sectors of aviation, which enabled the implementation of CAST safety enhancements to be impactful and widespread. As stated, the original CAST goal was very aggressive: to reduce the commercial aviation fatality rate in the United States by 80 percent in 10 years. CAST tackled this challenge by developing a process to identify and prioritize top safety areas through analyses of accidents and incidents and the chain of events leading up to them. Once an underlying problem was understood, the CAST membership identified and implemented high-leverage interventions or safety enhancements to reduce the fatality rate in these areas. This model has been extremely successful for the U.S. aviation industry. Accident data from 1998 to 2008 show that the fatal accident rate (with one or more fatalities per departure) of commercial air travel has been reduced in the U.S. by 83 percent, exceeding the original CAST goal. Since then, CAST has set new goals: to reduce the U.S. commercial aviation fatal accident rate by at least 50 percent between 2010 and 2025 and to work with international partners to reduce fatality risk in worldwide commercial aviation [31]. The analysis of commercial aviation accidents provided a solid foundation for the initial CAST focus. The CAST approach was so successful that fatal accidents became a rarity. That required an innovative approach to broadening the initial focus. The group turned their sights to more prognostic analyses using events that did not result in accidents but provided an indication of safety risk. This required operators to continually collect data through the voluntary programs enacted earlier, such as the FOQA and ASAP and its ATC analog, the Air Traffic Safety Action Program. These rich sources of information provide insight into millions of operations and help to identify potential systemic safety issues and trends. Traditionally, the sponsoring airline or FAA organizations kept these data sources. These organizations were willing to share these data sources at the national level and analyze them collectively and collaboratively to identify risks proactively. Determining the accident precursors would require dedicated technical expertise to mine and analyze this massive and constantly growing data set. So the Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS) program was initiated in 2007 to perform the data analytics. Learning from past experiences, FAA once again decided on employing a neutral third partyits Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) operated by MITRE CAASDto house, protect, and analyze the data supporting the needs of the CAST partnership. 4-2 Data sharing in the ASIAS program was entirely voluntary. Starting with seven participants, it has grown remarkably widespread. Currently, FAA and most air carriers, manufacturers, associations, and employee groups contribute data or advisory support. In fact, more than 40 airlines representing 99 percent of commercial aviation operations voluntarily contribute proprietary data. MITRE CAASD handles the data under strict confidentiality protections and uses data in aggregate analyses of systemic safety problems. MITRE CAASD mines and analyzes vast databases to track previously identified risks that require continuous monitoring, or to identify new risks or threats that have not been revealed by forensic investigations. The ASIAS program monitors known risks, those which have been identified previously and currently controlled. ASIAS analyzes the uneventful flights (those that did not experience an accident or significant safety event) to monitor for these known risks, which are precursors that have shown links to accidents. These risks include a characterization of the rate of occurrence of these precursors, and conditions for these precursors to occur. ASIAS participants and CAST use the information from known risk monitoring to track the effectiveness of mitigations that were implemented to reduce these risks and to provide an alert if there is an upward trend in a known risk. In one example, ASIAS extracted information about safety system alerts that warn pilots about terrain proximity. ASIAS metrics, based on captured flight parameters, were used to identify hotspots (areas of greatest alerts concentration). Combined with an analysis of voluntary text reports from pilots and controllers, the data sources reconstruct conditions that lead to alerts. With this information, CAST collectively developed safety enhancements for aircraft equipment upgrades and proposed route changes to reduce the frequency of proximity to terrain warnings. Once mitigations are in place, ASIAS continues to monitor these known risks to measure the effectiveness of the mitigation. The ASIAS program also seeks to identify latent risks, which are those that may have been present for years, setting up conditions that could ultimately result in an accident. An example of a latent risk is aircraft wing flap misconfiguration (or reconfiguration) during takeoff. While the importance of correct flap configuration is well understood, ASIAS first measured the incidence of misconfiguration during takeoff using a large data set from airline operations. The new information about the rate of occurrence and the conditions associated with these events contributed to the FAA issuing an official Safety Alert for Operators and CAST efforts to develop new mitigations to reduce the incidence [32]. Finally, the ASIAS program assesses the potential for emerging risks associated with the introduction of new operations and equipment, which may inadvertently contribute to unintended effects or anomalies. ASIAS analysts identify aspects of new operations and equipment that have safety relevance so that new threats can be identified early and resolved before they contribute to an accident. The public-private partnership has produced numerous aviation system safety benefits. CAST developed more than 100 safety enhancements, with the majority supported by detailed ASIAS analytics. By combining incident reporting with detailed data on operational activities, the identification of precursors has been much more successful via collaboration than within individual organizations alone [33]. 5-1 5 Structuring the Collaborative Public-Private Partnership \\nWe structure the collaborative public-private partnership for data sharing and safety improvement based on the CAST and ASIAS model. The public-private partnership convenes through a consensus decision-making group including representatives from both industry and regulators. These individuals work together to make consensus decisions (Figure 5-1 top-center box) on salient safety-related issues in the form of",
