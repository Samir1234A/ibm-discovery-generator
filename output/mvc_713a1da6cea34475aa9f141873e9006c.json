  "text": "FFS payments to quality indicators (e.g., measures that reinforce the right care at the right time) can be an ideal arrangement. However, for the majority of services, Category 2 should be used to smooth the transition into Category 3 and 4 APMs, and spur the delivery system improvements these payments enable. The Work Group has split Category 2 into subcategories A, B, and C, as outlined below: Payments placed into Category 2A involve payments for infrastructure investments that can \\nimprove the quality of patient care, even though payment rates are not adjusted in accordance with performance on quality metrics. For example, payments designated for staffing a care coordination nurse or upgrading to electronic health records would fall under Category 2A. Because investments in these and similar delivery enhancements will likely improve patient experience and quality of care, these types of FFS or per-member-per-month (PMPM) payments are considered an importantthough preliminarystep toward payment reform. \\n16 Although the Work Group was not tasked with developing specific recommendations on HIT or data sharing, it believes that providers should invest in interoperable systems; that administrative reporting requirements should be minimized as much as possible; that patients and caregivers should have free and ready access to patient records; and that HIT should be used to maintain patient registries and contribute to the development of clinical measures and guidelines. For additional guidance on how to approach data sharing in population-based payment models, see: LAN (2016). Accelerating and Aligning Population-Based Payment Models: Data Sharing. Available at https://hcp-lan.org/groups/pbp/ds-final-whitepaper/. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2546. 27 Payments placed into Category 2B provide positive or negative incentives to report quality data to \\nthe health plan andpreferablyto the public. Providers may have initial difficulties reporting clinical data accurately. Participation in a pay-for-reporting program therefore gives providers an opportunity to familiarize themselves with performance metrics, build internal resources to collect data, and better navigate a health plans reporting system. Because pay-for-reporting does not link payment to quality performance, participation in Category 2B payment models should be time limited, and participation in Category 2B payment models will typically evolve into subsequent categories. Payments are placed into Category 2C if they reward providers that perform well on quality metrics \\nand/or penalize providers that do not perform well, thus providing a significant linkage between payment and quality. For example, providers may receive higher or lower updates to their FFS baseline, or they may receive a percent reduction or increase on all claims paid, depending on whether they meet quality goals. In some instances, these programs have an extensive set of performance measures that assess clinical outcomes, such as a reduction in emergency room visits for individuals with chronic illnesses or a reduction in hospital-acquired infections. Payments in this subcategory are not subject to rewards or penalties for provider performance against aggregate cost targets, but may account for performance on a more limited set of utilization measures. As the evaluation literature demonstrates, Category 2A and 2B payments, for HIT and other infrastructure needed to assess and improve quality performance, are often insufficient on their own to catalyze significant delivery transformations.17 Providers should therefore use Category 2A and 2B payments as an on ramp to participation in subsequent categories. Providers will transition into Category 2C in different ways. In the private sector, few payment plans support pay-for-reporting arrangements, and providers often move directly into pay-for-performance models. By contrast, Medicare pay-for-reporting programs typically precede and serve as the foundation for pay-for- performance programs in the same facility setting. Irrespective of how the transition occurs, it is important for providers to move quickly into Category 2C arrangements. Payments that fall under Category 2 are distinguished from those that fall under Category 3 in two respects. First, Category 2 payments do not involve arrangements in which providers are rewarded for providing appropriate care or penalized for insufficiently reducing low-value care (e.g., shared savings or shared losses based on established cost targets). Second, FFS-based payments in Category 3 reflect, to a greater degree, care provided longitudinally, such that multiple providers are responsible for the cost and quality associated with a particular set of procedures or services. By contrast, Category 2 payments are typically limited to specific providers. APMs Built on Fee for Service Architecture (Category 3): Payment models classified in Category 3 are based on an FFS architecture, while providing mechanisms for the effective management of a set of procedures, an episode of care, or all health services provided for individuals. To accomplish this, Category 3 payments are based on cost (and occasionally utilization) performance against a target, irrespective of how the financial or utilization benchmark is established, updated, or adjusted. Additionally, payments in Category 3 are structured to encourage providers to deliver effective and efficient care. Episode-based and other types of bundled payments encourage care coordination because they cover a complete set of related services for a procedure that may be \\n17 See, for example: Mendelson A., et al. (2017). The Effects of Pay-for-Performance Programs on Health, Health Care Use, and Processes of Care: A Systematic Review. Annals of Internal Medicine, 166: 341-354. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2546. 28 delivered by multiple providers. Clinical episode payments fall into Category 3 if they are tied to specific procedures, such as hip replacement or back surgery. Due to the potential that providers may curtail necessary care to meet explicit cost and/or utilization targets in Category 3 APMs, it is essential for these APMs to include safeguards that go beyond the standard types of quality measures used in Category 2 APMs. Accordingly, Category 3 APMs must hold providers financially accountable for performance on available measures of appropriate care. In this context, appropriate care is delivered when patients receive the right care at the right time, in the right place, and at the right intensity. Appropriate care adheres to evidence-based guidelines and comparative effectiveness research; it avoids unnecessarily costly, harmful, and unnecessary procedures; its intensity is commensurate with patients goals, prognoses, and needs; and it reflects the outcome of shared decision-making among patients, their caregivers, and their clinicians. Several organizations and initiatives, including the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Choosing Wisely campaign, the National Academy of Medicine, and AcademyHealth working with the American Board of Internal Medicine, have further developed this concept of appropriate care by compiling lists of low-value procedures and never events, by investigating the root causes of low-value care, by designing decision-support tools to promote appropriate care, and by designing measures to assess rates of low- and no-value care. Some of the many topics used to measure appropriate care include preventable hospital admissions, unnecessary imaging, documentation of shared-decision-making and patient goals for end of life care, adherence to clinical guidelines for pre-term labor and delivery, appropriate use of medications, and rates of never events. Although cost (and/or occasionally utilization) performance is the distinguishing component of Category 3 APMs, Category 3 payments hold providers accountable for this wider range of activities and outcomes. This is consistent with the notion that cost saving on its own is not an appropriate goal for healthcare reform; rather, the goal is to generate cost savings by reducing the utilization of care that provides little to no value for patients. All Category 3 payments evaluate providers against financial benchmarks and, occasionally, utilization targets. The Category is further subdivided as follows:18 In Category 3A, providers have the opportunity to share in a portion of the savings they generate \\nagainst a cost target or by meeting utilization targets, if quality targets are met. However, providers \\n18 Please note that this definition of a Category 3 APM has been revised in the 2017 APM Framework Refresh. Please see Appendix A for additional details. Measures of Appropriate Care Appropriate care avoids wasteful tests and procedures that provide no benefit to patients, involves a high degree of care coordination to ensure efficient delivery, and encompasses everything patients need to achieve their personal health-related goals. Measures of appropriate care are essential for Category 3 and 4 APMs, to ensure that providers are incentivized to reduce/eliminate only care that is wasteful and potentially harmful for patients. http://www.choosingwisely.org/ Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2546. 29 do not need to compensate payers for a portion of the losses that result when cost or utilization targets are not met. In Category 3B, providers have the opportunity to share in a portion of the savings they generate \\nagainst a cost target or by meeting utilization targets, if quality targets are met. Additionally, payers recoup from providers a portion of the losses that result when cost or utilization targets are not met. Most ACO arrangements today can be placed into either Category 3A (most often) or Category 3B, depending on whether the underlying risk arrangement includes only upside shared savings or both upside shared savings and downside risk for providers. These and other Category 3 arrangements will advance clinical integration and affordability to a greater extent than payments in Category 2, because accountability for reductions in low value care provides stronger incentives",
