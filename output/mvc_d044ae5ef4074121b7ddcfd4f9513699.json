  "text": "    \"text\": \" DECEMBER 2017ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES www.mitre.org Live-Action Simulations Test Ideas, Save Time and Money\\nWill your new technical capability actually work in a joint mission? What about a natural disaster or other \\ncivil emergency? MITREs SIMEX process uses advanced simulations and the latest tactics to increase \\nmission success using realistic scenarios. In the Decision Theater, MITRE personnel experiment with various presentation styles in preparation for a SIMEX. The rails in the ceiling allow \\nthe nine stacks of displays at the front to move forward and backward to change operational scenarios. Imagine youre a Navy officer who needs to see if a new joint mission capability involving underwater drones is feasible. Or a civil-agency manager who wants to test out new \\ncommunications processes for first responders. How do you \\nassess complicated ideas quickly without spending a fortune? If youre that Navy officer, will your machine-to-machine \\ncommunication conflict with the need for human decision-making? \\nAnd if youre using new processes and devices, will interoperability \\nbetween joint commands be an issue? If youre a civil agency \\nmanager, will your communications connect your cooperating \\nagencies without delay or misunderstandings? One way to find out is with a MITRE SIMEXTM session. \\nSIMEX is a contraction for simulation experiment. It offers \\na special mix of technical and operational capabilities for \\ngovernment agencies that want to try out new ideas by using \\ndedicated, state-of-the-art laboratories. A SIMEX allows mission personnel to develop concepts \\nof operations, or CONOPS, in a realistic, controlled synthetic \\nenvironment at MITRE facilities in McLean, Virginia. Operators \\npractice techniques and procedures using the latest technology. \\nSIMEXs use real command-and-control systems with simulated \\nweapons and sensors so military and civilian operators can execute \\nthe various crisis scenarios. Save Time, Keep Costs Down\\n SIMEXs allow agencies to wring out a proof-of-concept faster and \\nat lower cost than a full-blown in-the-field exercise. For example, in \\na recent classified SIMEX, the sponsor noted: In three experimental \\nruns, operators made real-time decisions for weapon assignment, \\nengagement timing, and movements. The interaction of live operators, \\nwith high-fidelity engagement simulation, enabled weapon tactics to \\nevolve rapidly and iteratively over the course of the SIMEX. In another classified experiment, representatives from different \\nmilitary organizations worked with personnel sitting in multiple \\nlocations. The SIMEX addressed 36 different scenarios related to an \\nadvanced weapon system. Participants gained new insights into \\noperations and identified areas for improvement in their current \\nsystems. The event reduced overall costs and avoided hundreds of \\nunnecessary staff hours. The activity also set the stage for a live \\ndemonstrationall before burning a single gallon of fuel. SIMEXs provide quantitative analysis while still allowing for \\ninnovation and serendipity, says Jim Dear, who manages and \\ncoordinates all the SIMEX laboratory experiments. Dear has been \\ninvolved with nearly 60 SIMEXs since they began in 2001. Hes \\noverseen experiments on important topics ranging from joint surface \\nwarfare, bio-security, and maritime domain awareness, to special \\noperations, missile defense, irregular warfare, and more. MITRE Project Stories Many of them are classified, but MITRE \\nalso conducts unclassified SIMEXs for \\nagencies such as the Census Bureau, Border \\nPatrol, Homeland Security, and IRS. For \\nexample, a few years ago, MITRE worked \\nwith national law enforcement agencies and \\nVirginia state agencies to conduct a SIMEX \\nto demonstrate how social media could help \\nor hinder response times during a crisis. Two Exceptional Labs: \\nNSEL and SEAL\\n The events typically occur in two MITRE \\nlabs, both in McLean, Virginia. The first lab \\nis the National Security Experimentation \\nLaboratory, or NSEL, which is sponsored by \\nthe Office of the Secretary of Defense. Created \\nin 2001, its the computational workhorse for \\na SIMEX. Mission managers can connect to \\nseveral government and contractor facilities to \\nrun experiments that are service-specific, or \\njoint in operation. NSEL uses real command-and-control \\nsystems with simulated weapons and \\nsensors. Military and civilian personnel can \\nexecute crisis action scenarios to improve \\ntheir planning and reaction times. To test \\ninteroperability in a distributed environment, \\nthe NSEL uses a variety of secure networks. The newest Simulation, Experimentation \\nand Analysis Lab, or SEAL, opened in \\nearly 2017. The SEAL supports analysis, \\nexperimentation, testing, training, and mission \\nrehearsal for classified and unclassified \\noperations. It puts sponsors (friendly Blue Cell \\noperators) in a visual environment that shows \\nhow their new mission capabilities will work \\nagainst opposing forces (Red Cell operators). \\nHuge, high-definition monitors can be moved \\nto change the look of command centers for the \\nBlue Cell. Observers can see a SIMEX in action \\nwithout disturbing operators in either the Blue \\nCell or the Red Cell. (See The SEALWhere \\nthe Action Is.) From Scenario Planning to \\nPost-Event Analysis\\n The whole SIMEX process from planning \\nto final report is normally five to six months, \\nDear says. First, MITRE staff work with \\nour sponsors to design the simulation \\ninfrastructure. During the integration \\nand testing process, our data collection \\nteam leader builds the Data Collection and \\nAnalysis Plan that defines essential data \\ncollection to support the SIMEX objectives. The SIMEX itself takes place over two \\nweeks. The first week includes operator \\ntraining on the new SIMEX CONOPS and \\ntechnology. The second week includes 8 to 10 \\nthree-hour scenarios when mission operators \\nexecute the SIMEX. MITRE staff capture \\nparticipants observations and experiences \\nfor reference. These can be used to develop \\nstrategy, tactics, and related technologies. In parallel, the NSEL data collection team \\nexecutes the Data Collection and Analysis \\nPlan and produces incremental After-Action \\nReviews. Post-SIMEX analysis captures \\nlessons learned, operator feedback, and data \\ndriven measures of effectiveness. This gives \\nprogram managers, science and technology \\ndirectors, and warfighters, the information \\nto make informed decisions. About a month \\nafter the SIMEX, the data collection team \\nproduces a briefing and final report on the \\nSIMEX results, using the agreed-upon data \\ncollection plan. Augmenting the written \\nreports for every SIMEX are 8-10-minute video \\nhighlight reels depicting the crucial moments \\nduring SIMEX execution. Each SIMEX is custom-designed to test \\na new mission capability to its maximum, \\nDear says. As new technology rapidly \\ncomes along, theres a good chance of \\ninteroperability problems, or man-machine \\ninterface issues. Every SIMEX teaches our \\nsponsors and us something new. We have a \\ngreat combination of capabilities that allow \\nour sponsors to simulate any situation. The Decision Theater area is re-arranged, allowing Air Force and Army \\noperators to do a hot wash (quickly discuss the results) of a live scenario.

MITRE SIMEX is a trademark of the MITRE Corporation. The SEALWhere the Action Is\\nThe Simulation, Experimentation and \\nAnalysis Lab, or SEAL, manages the \\npresentation portion of a SIMEX. Its \\nwhere the Blue Cell, the good guys, take \\non the Red Cell guys, says Jim Dear. About half of the SEALs 5,000 sq. ft. is \\nthe Decision Theater, where Blue Cell \\noperators interact with the simulation. The \\nRed Cell operators, using the latest field \\ntactics against the Blue Cell, work in the \\nEvent Support area that is smaller and \\nseparate from the Decision Theater. The Decision Theater holds SEALs rapidly \\nreconfigurable A/V equipment. In the front \\nare nine ceiling-mounted tracks, each \\ncarrying a stack of three 55-inch displays. \\nEach stack can move 30 feet back and forth. \\nAt the side of the room are six ceiling-\\nmounted tracks that carry a stack of three \\nlarge displays, and can move 10 feet back \\nand forth. We reconfigure the stacks to represent \\nvarious kinds of command centers and \\ndifferent set-ups depending on the \\nmissions, Dear says. We can also divide \\nup the commands and isolate command \\nelements by moving the displays around. \\nSo, every SIMEX is a little different. The \\nDecision Theater also has fully customizable \\nceiling-mounted theater lights to provide a \\nhuge combination of ambiance settings for \\nsimulation purposes. The Observation Room allows visitors \\nto watch SIMEX scenarios without \\ndistracting operators. The A/V capability \\npresents various rooms on a display in the \\nObservation Room so that visitors can see \\nand hear what the operators are saying. The SEALs embedded audio and video \\nrecording capability captures everything \\nthat happens during the SIMEX, classified \\n or unclassified. Thats important, Dear \\nsays. It allows us to capture insights as they \\noccur, and supplement our briefings and \\nafter-action reports. Theres also a Unit Operations area \\nthat supports simulated individual unit \\noperations, and a Reception Room for \\nvisitors, credentialing, and lab overviews. \",",
