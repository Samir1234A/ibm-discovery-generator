  "text": "states for internal \\ntask forces to examine their \\nimproper payments and \\ndevelop solutions. The \\nagency has seen improve-\\nments in those states since \\nthis began, so they believe \\nthere is a cause-and-effect \\nrelationship. SUCCESS STORY 11 From the perspective of policy and priority drivers of motivation, MITREs February 2016 \\nstudy report,15 applied literature and research found that benefit paying organizations are \\noften focused on the number of payments processed rather than their accuracy. Agencies \\nneed to adopt an approach of more closely balancing mission (for example, timeliness of \\npayment, maximizing participation in benefits programs) with management (for example, \\naccuracy of payment) in order to emphasize proper stewardship over federal funds. One \\nagency indicated that while employees should understand the need for balance between \\nservice to claimants and stewardship of funds, finding the right balance can be difficult. It is helpful for agencies to reinforce improper payment reduction policies by establishing \\nquantifiable objectives and metrics focused on quality control and accuracy. Benefits \\npaying programs can be motivated to improve delivery quality if employee performance \\nmetrics include accuracy of the original payments (not just corrections when those \\npayments are identified as incorrect) and if managers are rewarded for overall quality \\ncontrol. Applied literature and research also indicated that preventive and deterrent \\nactions are more difficult to measure in the near-term, so the focus of measurement should \\nbe on long-term trends. 2.1.3 Leadership Although effective leadership entails a wide range of actions, one \\nleadership factor that emerged is the focus and emphasis that \\nleaders place on Payment Integrity. Accountability officials, \\napplied literature and research indicated that a critical success \\nfactor in Payment Integrity is political and senior agency leaders having the will to address \\nthe issue, communicating that throughout their organizations, and holding themselves and \\nothers accountable. Numerous agency officials cited the importance of regular statements \\non Payment Integrity from top leaders and accountability among senior staff, with some \\nadding that tone at the top is essential for getting the organizations attention on the issue \\nand keeping it there. A number of agency officials stated that they believed it is important to work across the \\norganization on improper payments issuesboth in general and with respect to specific \\nissues. In this regard, multiple agencies described their senior level boards that promote \\nshared accountability and an acting as one approach across the organization in order to \\nenhance coordination, collaboration, and decision-making. One agency has designated a \\nSenior Accountable Official in each component to be responsible for developing improper \\npayment remediation plans. In all cases, it is critical for senior leaders to follow through on \\ntheir words with actions that produce resultsreductions in improper payments. \\n15 GOVERNMENT-WIDE PAYMENT INTEGRITY: NEW APPROACHES AND SOLUTIONS NEEDED (MTR 160040, February \\n2016) 12 2.1.4 Organizational Culture The degree of concern about Payment Integrity appears to vary \\nacross government. Some agency and accountability officials said \\nthat fraud, in particular, angers leaders and staff, and that most of \\nthem genuinely care about the improper payments issue, taking \\npride in their organizational mission and their efforts to prevent, identify, and recover \\nimproper payments. Other officials believed that these pockets of caring need to be \\nbroadened to a government-wide culture that starts at the very top levels, stating that \\nPayment Integrity needs to be a political imperative and that agency heads need to be held \\nresponsible for meeting goals. Further, just as at the federal level, some agency officials \\nindicated that it is important to establish accountability by emphasizing overall integrity to \\nthe states and by creating a culture of Payment Integrity among all entities making \\npayments. Some agency officials also indicated that it is difficult to keep leaders and staff focused on \\nPayment Integrity because of all their competing priorities. Others indicated that many \\nleaders and staff in their organization recognize that resources are scarce, so they simply \\ncannot afford to have improper payments that divert resources from deserving recipients; \\nhowever, this perspective took time to develop and integrate into the culture of the \\norganization. 2.1.5 Systems (Policies and Procedures) Managers and staff, like senior leaders, need to be accountable for \\nPayment Integrity. Some agencies include Payment Integrity in \\nsenior leaders, managers, and staff performance standards, while \\nothers have indirect linkages between the standards and agency / \\ncomponent goals to reduce improper payments. Applied literature and research echo this \\napproach, indicating that organizations should assign roles and responsibilities for meeting \\nPayment Integrity goals and ensure accountability through a reward system at both the \\norganizational and individual levels. These Payment Integrity goals and metrics need to be \\nbalanced with, not in conflict with, program goals and metrics. As GAO noted in its July \\n2015 document, A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs, performance metrics for employees can perpetuate this conflict [between timeliness and accuracy] and create disincentives to combat fraud. For instance, we reported in November 2014 that one programs performance measures for its frontline employees responsible for processing applications for benefits focused on prompt processing, resulting in a disincentive for employees to report potential fraud because of the time it requires to develop a fraud referral. Effective performance metrics reinforce the objectives of fraud risk management activities and strike a balance with other activities that serve the programs mission.16 Applied literature and research suggest that cross-government policies on Payment \\nIntegrity might improve solutions and accountability. A completely decentralized approach \\n16 A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs (GAO-15-593SP, July 2015) 13 to addressing improper payments can generate ad hoc, niche, agency-specific solutions to \\nwhat are actually cross-government issues like identity and eligibility. On the other hand, \\nfor some challenges a coordinated, systematic approach can motivate agencies to work \\nmore effectively together to solve government-wide problems. The solution is not either-\\nor; instead, it is finding the right balance between doing both. Some processes need to be \\nstandardized, while at the same time, agencies need to be able to adapt those processes \\nwhen it makes them more effective. Agency officials indicated that it is important for the states, not just federal agencies, to hold grantees, contractors, program beneficiaries, and others accountable. Examples of this include states: Charging contractors damages for improperly invoicing the government. Prosecuting benefits fraud, and if a person is found guilty, taking away their \\neligibility for the program. Using data matching programs. For example, a GAO report about SNAP stated that \\n\\\"in 2014, GAO found that selected states employed a range of tools to detect \\npotential program recipient fraud, though they faced some challengesAll 11 \\nselected states that GAO reviewed matched information provided by SNAP \\napplicants and recipients against various data sources to check for accuracy, but \\nefforts varied widely among these states.\\\"17 One agencys officials also advised that if the states do not conduct the activities and \\nachieve the results outlined in their improper payments corrective action plans, then the \\nagency provides more monitoring, requires more reporting, and gives more technical \\nassistance. Related to this, some agency officials offered the opinion that communicating \\nproactively with the states can help them prevent improper payments. One program, for \\nexample, is increasing its efforts to provide advance notification to states of upcoming \\nguidance changes and increasing technical assistance to states, including identifying and \\naddressing potential drivers of improper payment rate changes. 2.1.6 Work Unit Climate Work unit climate directly impacts employee motivation, \\nenhancing it when employees have clear goals, roles, and \\nresponsibilities; when they trust and respect each other; and when \\nthey cooperate and work together as a team. In particular, an optimal work unit climate \\nemphasizes teams and units collaborating internally and working effectively with other \\nteams and units across the organization. Some officials indicated their agency has \\nimplemented this concept, describing their working groups at the manager and staff level \\nthat assist senior leaders with coordination, collaboration, decision-making, and visibility / \\naccountability in addressing improper payments. \\n17 SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM Policy Changes and Calculation Methods Likely Affect Improper \\nPayment Rates, and USDA Is Taking Steps to Help Address Recipient Fraud (GAO-16-708T, July 8, 2016) 14 2.1.7 Task and Individual Skills Applied literature and research identified the importance of staff \\nskillsets in increasing accuracy and preventing improper \\npayments. These skills must be sustained and improved over time, \\nwhich costs money. Further, using humans to conduct analytical tasks to help prevent \\nimproper payments may be more rewarding, and thereby more motivating, than merely \\nprocessing claims, which in many agencies could be more substantially automated. 2.2 Individual Employee Motivation Academic research on individual employee motivation has produced a \\nmodel called the high-performance cycle, which highlights key \\naspects of three elements relating to goals, feedback and rewards that \\nmust be present for individual employee motivation efforts to be \\neffective. The model emphasizes establishing appropriate goals in \\norder to drive performance, along with rewards to recognize high performance. The impact \\nof goals on performance can be enhanced when employees commit to goals, see the goals \\nas important, feel confident in their ability to reach the goals, and receive feedback on \\nprogress toward the goals. As shown in Figure 1, all three elementsgoals, performance,",
