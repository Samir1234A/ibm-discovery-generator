  "text": "is not designed to be implemented in all conditions, so controllers will use their knowledge,\\nand automation support, as needed, to determine when IM operations should be conducted.\\nATC will still be responsible for appropriately sequencing and spacing aircraft prior to the\\ninitiation of IM. Such set-up can be conducted via current ATC capabilities or in more complex\\nenvironments with new capabilities. Set-up involves ATC issuing an IM clearance that either\\nuses speed adjustments alone, or a single turn and then speed adjustments. The IM clearance\\nincludes information such as lead aircraft identification, IM clearance type (e.g., achieve-by 2-5 then-maintain), ASG units (i.e., time or distance) and value (e.g., 90 seconds and 15 miles), and\\nIM special points (e.g., Achieve-By Point [ABP] and Planned Termination Point [PTP]). Once this information is provided to the flight crew, it is entered into the flight deck IM\\nequipment. The equipment checks that the appropriate information has been entered for the\\noperation and that the lead aircraft is in surveillance range. If the lead aircraft is not in\\nsurveillance range, the system continues to search. Once the aircraft is in range, is on the\\nexpected trajectory, and meets the necessary performance requirements, IM is initiated and\\nthe equipment starts providing information (primarily the speed to fly, termed IM speed).\\nSituation awareness information is also provided to assist the flight crew in monitoring the\\nprogression of IM. With the presentation of each new IM speed, the flight crew ensures that the IM speed is\\ncompatible with the aircrafts current configuration and environmental conditions. The flight\\ncrew is expected to follow the IM speeds in a timely manner consistent with other cockpit\\nduties unless other conditions (e.g., safety, operational, equipment, or regulatory issues)\\nprevent doing so. If any of these issues arise, the flight crew will maintain their last\\nimplemented IM speed and contact ATC to report being unable to conduct IM. Similarly, if ATC\\nhas any conditions that prevent continued IM operations, the controller will contact the flight\\ncrew and terminate or suspend IM. If the IM is suspended, the controller may choose to resume\\nIM at a later point, should the appropriate conditions exist. If no issues arise for either the\\ncontroller or the flight crew causing a suspension or termination, the flight crew continues\\nfollowing the IM speeds and the controller continues monitoring the operation until the aircraft\\nreaches the PTP. At this point, the flight deck IM equipment removes the IM speed from the\\ndisplay and IM is terminated. For additional information on the broader IM concept and preliminary requirements, see DO-\\n361 and DO-328A (RTCA, 2015a, 2015b). These documents describe near-term operations;\\nhowever, updates are being developed to enable more advanced operational implementations\\nsuch as dependent runway operations. For further details on the IM capabilities utilized in this\\nsimulation, see Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2. 2.2.2 IM Benefits\\nIM takes advantage of advances in technology to support current operations, and allows the\\ncontroller to delegate the low-level, tactical spacing task to IM capable aircraft. Controllers\\ncurrently try to achieve desired spacings by giving maneuver instructions to aircraft without the\\nflight crews necessarily having an understanding of the goals. Instead of simply being able to\\nassign a specific in-trail spacing goal, the controller has to provide several workload intensive\\ninstructions which include trial-and-error to determine the appropriate goal. By allowing flight\\ncrews to achieve or maintain an ASG, controllers may be able to more efficiently manage\\nmerging aircraft and improve throughput. The remainder of this section will review the benefits\\nmechanism and summarize related results from past IM activities. It will also highlight other\\nexpected benefits. 2-6 2.2.2.1 Throughput Benefits\\nIM is a relative spacing operation, in which trajectory corrections are made relative to real-time\\nbehavior of a lead aircraft (i.e., the lead aircrafts ATA). This is in contrast to an absolute spacing\\noperation, such as time-based metering, in which an aircraft is controlled to cross a specific\\npoint at a designated time. IM is a tactical tool and the spacing objective can be based on an\\nunderlying schedule, separation standard, or other operational need. In an absolute spacing operation, the error distribution of both aircraft must be considered\\nwhen setting the schedule and spacing goals. This is because both aircraft achieve the schedule\\nindependently and could contribute to a spacing that encroaches on the minimum separation\\nstandard. With IM, however, the error distribution of the lead aircraft does not need to be\\nconsidered because the IM Aircraft is correcting for it. Therefore, a spacing goal for an IM pair\\ncan be closer than would otherwise be possible with absolute spacing alone (e.g., TOAC or\\nterminal metering without IM). Figure 2-3 contrasts the error distributions that must be\\naccounted for in absolute (top diagram) and relative (bottom diagram) spacing operations. Figure 2-3. Absolute (Top) and Relative (Bottom) Spacing Operations Utilization of Aircraft\\nSpacing Error Distributions 2-7 With the spacing goal set, IM can further be used to improve spacing consistency and\\npredictability by enabling flight crews to make more frequent and efficient speed adjustments\\nthan are possible with ground-based metering and pilot-controller voice communications. This\\nis because airborne equipment can provide more speeds than the ground to make trajectory\\ncorrections. Also, since an aircraft will know its own trajectory more precisely than a ground\\nsystem, the speeds will be generated using better information and will thus be more efficient.\\nSetting, then achieving, a consistent, low-variance spacing interval reduces the time interval\\nbetween aircraft in a traffic flow, which allows each aircraft to be spaced closer to a given\\nseparation standard. This enables increased arrival throughput and sector or facility capacity. The performance metric used by the FAA to measure delivery benefits is termed Inter-Arrival\\nTime (IAT). The IAT is defined as the difference in time when two consecutive aircraft cross a\\ncommon point. For example, if a lead aircraft crosses the runway threshold at 12:30:30 and a\\ntrail aircraft crosses the runway threshold at 12:31:50, the IAT is 80 seconds. A population of\\nIATs will have a Standard Deviation (SD) associated with it, which indicates the extent of\\nvariations in the IAT. Assuming a normal distribution, one SD will include 68% of the range of\\nIATs in the population. Table 2-1 shows the assumed one IAT SD at the Final Approach Fix (FAF)\\nused to model benefits for different traffic management capabilities. Table 2-1.

DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a) Ground-based Interval Management-Spacing (GIM-S) Each added capability in the first column of Table 2-1 reduces the IAT variance, which means\\nthat aircraft can be placed closer together relative to a separation standard (i.e., a lower\\nspacing goal can be used), without an increase in the number of controller interventions\\nneeded to avoid separation violations. 2-8 Figure 2-4 illustrates how IAT SD distributions relate to a separation standard. For example, if\\nthe IAT SD is 12 seconds as with GIM-S and TSAS, aircraft will need to be spacing with an IAT of\\napproximately 81 seconds to avoid an unacceptable number of controller interventions (as\\nshown in the magenta distribution1). If a controller tries to space aircraft closer together and\\nthe IAT SD is limited to 12 seconds, more controller interventions will be needed to prevent\\nseparation violations. However, if the IAT SD can be reduced to 5 seconds with IM (as shown in\\nthe red distribution), aircraft can be delivered at approximately 65 seconds with the same rate\\nof controller interventions as the 12-second IAT SD distribution. Figure 2-4. Various IAT SD Distributions Relative to the Separation Standard [Reprinted from Weitz, 2017] 1 The 81-second value is derived assuming a uniform flow, a minimum (time-based) separation of 53 seconds at\\nthe FAF, and a controller intervention rate of 1 per 100 operations.

(2005) demonstrated the benefit of accurate and low variance spacing when\\ncomparing an en route metering capability only, to one with IM (i.e., all the aircraft were IM\\ncapable). In the condition with IM, almost all aircraft were within 5 seconds of the ASG. The en\\nroute metering capability alone had a wider and flatter distribution shown in Figure 2-5. The IM\\ndistribution translated to an additional two aircraft per hour. Prevot et al (2007) found similar\\nresults where IM (70% of the aircraft) had a reduced mean and variance and allowed for an\\nadditional aircraft or two per hour (Figure 2-6). Figure 2-5.
