  "text": "Delta Air Lines prior to beginning data collection. Those meetings highlighted their internal ACARS processes and ramifications associated with MITRE CAASDs approach to using that data. This initial effort allowed MITRE CAASD to both address practical data collection issues and ensure protection and appropriate use of proprietary operational data. 2.1 Data Collection Framework Because Airbus and Boeing have implemented relatively common ACARS feature sets, the collection of data across a large proportion of an airlines fleet is assured. For Delta Air Lines, the agreement for this study focused on collecting data from their Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft. MITRE CAASD has previous experience with ACARS data requests that are compatible with those aircraft models [3, 4]. There are two main mechanisms for generating an ACARS downlink: the ACARS report can be generated from AOC uplinked requests or by an automated reporting option within the aircraft avionics. Pilot initiated reports can also be downlinked, but were not considered for this work to reduce complexity and avoid flight deck involvement in the collection activity. 2-3 Previous route identification efforts [3, 4] revealed that flight plan reports collected well before the end of the flight may differ from what was actually flown. As such, selecting viable report trigger points is critical to minimizing the errors introduced by late flight plan changes. For this effort, MITRE CAASD and Delta Air Lines chose to employ existing AOC uplinked report requests to begin collection and allow for data intake and processing maturation. MITRE CAASD explored alternative message content and the possibility to add new AOC requests (triggers), but those actions would likely require airline data processing changes and thus were tabled for the initial collection effort. Potential use of automated (triggered) data reports was also discussed in the Delta Air Lines coordination meetings. Report automation is often activated in the onboard ACARS avionics and monitored by airlines ground systems to streamline the collection of routine aircraft operations. Because this method involves changing both aircraft configuration and the groundside data processing, flexibility in adjusting the trigger location is limited. Therefore, fully automated triggers were not used in this research study. Both of these report generation options require airlines to disclose their data collection processes, potentially revealing proprietary or competition sensitive processes. While ACARS may be standard, downlinked data generation is airline specific and involves the entire range of airline business and human resource practices (e.g., pilots, flight operations, avionics maintenance, information technology, and corporate leadership). Discovery of what ACARS messages are available and collected or could be collected requires negotiation and legal agreements to adapt airline processes in response to MITRE CAASDs data requirements. Given an airline agreement to share ACARS data, the collection process is relatively straight forward. ACARS reports are in a compact but defined character format that can be easily exchanged as text files. For this initial effort, Delta Air Lines periodically e-mailed these files. Other potential data collection schemes include MITRE CAASD establishing a ACARS network connection and tapping the airlines data stream directly. Alternatively, wired delivery of the airline data directly to a MITRE CAASD repository is possible. MITRE CAASD could also pursue formal data management options to restrict access and protect airline data. 2.2 FMS Route Downlink Message General Guidelines During discussions with Delta Air Lines technical experts, a set of collection guidelines were compiled and can be re-used for future discussions with other airline data collection participants. While a variety of ACARS message content is available, obtaining that data may require detailed coordination with individual airlines. A summary of collection guidelines generated during meetings with Delta Air Lines is summarized below. Downlink requests should be transparent to pilots Delta Air Lines indicated a \\npreference for methods that have no impact on normal pilot responsibilities or cockpit activities. Onboard FMS systems offer pilot initiated ACARS status reports; however, MITRE CAASDs data collection was designed to avoid flight deck involvement. Ensure downlink requests are acceptable to airline standard reporting processes the use \\nof REQFPN,RP (request flight plan, active route report) was currently in routine use by Delta Air Lines. Changing the request to REQPOS,RP (request position, active route report) adds current aircraft position and time tag to the active route response. While that 2-4 data is helpful for MITRE CAASDs follow-on processing, the Position (POS) request was unacceptable to Delta Air Lines as those requests would interfere with one of their primary report automation processes. Downlink content must be compatible with airline and pilot labor relations agreements \\nmay involve both airline corporate and Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) approvals of the collection and intended use of the data. Additional ground based triggering (uplink requests) of reports must be compatible with \\nairline operation processes new ground request (triggers) must be negotiated and integrated with airline operations. Airborne based triggering (avionics automation) of reports requires fleet avionics updates \\nand associated maintenance even simple requests may be expensive to implement and can be highly dependent on airline fleet mix and their ACARS configuration. Flexibility with data transfer (text or other formats) must consider both MITRE \\nCAASD and airline time, hands-on, and infrastructure costs. 2.2.1 Delta Air Lines Agreement Details MITRE CAASD and Delta Air Lines entered into a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) which protects the data that Delta Air Lines shares with MITRE CAASD. It allows MITRE CAASD to receive, analyze, and aggregate the downlinked flight plan data into relevant statistics which can then be publicly shared. The NDA does not allow public sharing of any identifiable data (e.g., by flight number and date of the downlink). Delta Air Lines will periodically collect all the downlinked data in a text file, which will be initially emailed to MITRE CAASD. Once the expansion to the full fleet mix of aircraft continues, this data transmission process may be automated through electronic file transfers (FTP) or a MITRE CAASD Aeronautical Radio, Incorporated (ARINC) connection. 2.3 ACARS Messaging and Avionics Support While aircraft avionics can differ, the ACARS capability resides in a combination of communication management unit (CMU) and flight management system (FMS) features (or interfaced avionics units) that establish and support the air-to-ground datalink connection. Attachment 7 of the ARINC 702A Flight Management Computer System Characteristics [5] describes the ACARS uplink and downlink formats and syntax defined and built from Imbedded Message Identifiers (IMI) and Imbedded Element Identifiers (IEI). These identifiers are generally managed by the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC) to be standard across the industry, but operator customizations can be created for internal use. The ARINC 702A document acknowledges the creative expansion of these identifiers and when found to have value, encourages standardization with the note users are requested to advise the AEEC staff as need arises. Typically, onboard systems employ configuration files for ACARS features to allow operators the ability to restrict or expand flight information streams. Reasons to restrict ACARS features includes the per-bit cost of message content exchanges and the airlines groundside data intake and retention policies. While a number of report downlink request combinations can be created, there is no guarantee that an airlines ACARS customization will support those requests. 2-5 2.3.1 ACARS Messages Initial Collection Effort Early work with airlines and a small ACARS sample from the Delta Air Lines data collection are discussed in Appendix A. Aside from providing details of the downlinked data content, Appendix A contrasts Delta Air Lines data with MITRE CAASDs 737 FMS Test Bench ACARS reports and provides examples of other available ACARS downlinks. MITRE CAASDs Test Bench leverages desktop FMS trainer capabilities to provide simulation of FMS behavior; the Test Bench has been used for various studies, including Metroplex procedure design activities and trials of NextGen TBO and electronic flight bag capabilities. Examination of Delta Air Lines downlink data revealed that their uplink requests are tailored by aircraft type. Subtle differences between MITRE CAASDs Test Bench results and the Delta Air Lines downlinks indicates message customization and aircraft variation exists, but can be ignored by MITRE CAASD for these initial approach usage analysis efforts. Given those downlink variations, it is important to have a clear understanding of any operator- specific ACARS behavior. In future efforts, the downlink content and format employed for Delta Air Lines data intake and processing designs may need case-by-case adaptation to each airlines downlink content. 2.3.2 Potential for ACARS Trigger and Report Customization Previous data analysis efforts have indicated that flight plan reports collected well before the end of the flight may differ from what was actually flown. The ability to eliminate that source of error involves selecting suitable report trigger points. Those collection triggers can either be implemented as ground uplinks or leverage on-board avionics features. To customize ground side automation, the airline must agree to make changes to their uplink delivery (manual or automated) processes. For airborne automation, the avionics (generally the FMS holding the flight plans) must be altered using program option selections to define airline specified messaging. Two examples that customize ACARS implementations use Boeings Adaptable Datalink Databases (ADDB) or Airbus Aircraft Modifiable Information (AMI) files, which",
