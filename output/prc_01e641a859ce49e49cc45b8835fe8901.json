All (100%) Week 2-3 TRACON controllers agreed they could easily assess whether the IM Trail \\nAircraft would remain behind the CSL during the approach for both monitor configurations with \\nIM PA Tools On and IM PA Tools Off. The majority of Week 2-3 TRACON controllers agreed with \\nthe Data Block CSL Distance On / WSL-P Off (86%) and with Data Block CSL Distance Off / WSL-P \\nOn (71%) configurations. Overall, no practical differences between the Monitor and IM PA Tool \\nconfigurations were observed. This same question, whether they could easily assess whether the IM Trail Aircraft would \\nremain behind the CSL during the approach, was also examined for the 28R Final controllers at \\nthe end of each run (QT1). TRACON controller responses were also then examined with respect \\nto IM PA Tool configuration. Response Means and Standard Deviations for the 28R Final \\ncontroller position are summarized in Table 5-38.

Note: o indicates NCT controller responses. Responses were variable, but a majority (70%) of TRACON controllers agreed the 28R Final \\ncontroller position could easily assess whether the IM Trail Aircraft would remain behind the \\nCSL during the approach for both IM PA Tool configurations. Several comments from the \\ncontrollers that disagreed suggested this was because there was no indication of where the CSL \\nwould be located before they cleared the IM Trail Aircraft for IM PA. Overall, no practical \\ndifference between the IM PA Tool configurations was observed. Other open-ended comments for this question included: (NCT / Tools On) Was not easy to determine, but wasn't a concern as I knew the Monitor \\ncontroller could react next to the CSL warning if needed.\\n(NCT / Tools On) I did not pay as close attention after I shipped them. WSL and Pre-Activation Features6.5.3.2\\nAt the end of Day 2 (QT3), after experiencing the nominal scenarios across all IM PA Tool and \\nmonitor configurations, controllers were asked if the WSL Line and Data Block Distance to WSL \\nfeatures were useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task. Responses are shown for all \\nTRACON (NCT and non-NCT combined) and Tower Only. Response Means and Standard \\nDeviations are summarized in Table 5-39. Scale responses are shown in Figure 5-48.

The WSL Line and Data Block Distance to WSL features were useful for the overall IM PA \\nmonitoring task. Note: o indicates NCT controller responses. All (100%) TRACON controllers agreed the WSL Line was useful for the overall IM PA monitoring \\ntask (M=96.4; SD=4.7). However, only one TRACON controller agreed the Data Block Distance to \\nthe WSL was useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task (M=32.9; SD=27.2). This was the same \\ncontroller in Section 5.5.3.1 that agreed the Distance to the CSL was useful. Another controller \\nneither agreed nor disagreed. --------------------------------- At the end of each run (QT1), controllers were asked if they could easily assess whether the IM \\nTrail Aircraft would remain forward of the WSL during the approach, when applicable. Their \\nresponses were then examined with respect to IM PA Tool configuration. Response Means and \\nStandard Deviations for the monitor configurations are summarized in Table 5-40. Scale \\nresponses are shown in Figure 5-49. Only TRACON controller responses were included in the \\nanalysis. Table 5-40.

I could easily assess whether the IM Trail Aircraft would remain forward of the WSL during \\nthe approach, when applicable. *Combined Monitor configuration / **28R Monitor configuration\\nNote: o indicates Week 1 TRACON controller responses for reference. These are not included in the M and SD computations. All (100%) Week 2-3 TRACON controllers agreed they could easily assess whether the IM Trail \\nAircraft would remain forward of the WSL for the Combined Monitor position with IM PA Tools \\nOn (M=88.9; SD=13.2). Responses were variable, but a majority (86%) agreed for the Combined \\nMonitor position with IM PA Tools Off (M=75.4; SD=34.0). This higher variability was due to one \\ncontroller who strongly disagreed and noted that the WSL should appear sooner. Other \\ncontrollers agreed in the comments that the WSL should appear sooner, though they still \\nresponded on the agree side of the scale. Responses were variable for the other IM PA Tool configurations. However, the majority (71%) \\nof Week 2-3 TRACON controllers agreed with the Data Block CSL Distance On / WSL-P Off \\n(M=60.7; SD=38.1) and the majority (57%) agreed with Data Block CSL Distance Off / WSL-P On \\n(M=69.6; SD=28.6). lxiv\\n As described in Section 5.8.2, a three-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) test found that though \\nall or most controllers agreed they could easily asses the IM Trail Aircraft with respect to both \\nthe CSL versus the WSL, they agreed more strongly for the CSL. No statistically significant \\ndifferences were observed between Monitor and IM PA Tool configurations or any of the factor \\ncombinations. Several controllers made open-ended comments across these scenarios that suggested the WSL \\nappeared later than desired and that having the WSL-P would help. These included: (NCT / Tools On) I'm just not sure where the WSL will be until the preview pops up, once \\nit does show up then I am more easily able to assess.\\n(Non-NCT TRACON / Tools On) Once the line appeared, it was easy.\\n(NCT / Tools On) The WSL should come on sooner so that if aircraft is lagging, we could \\nuse speed to get aircraft in front of WSL instead of sending around. \\n(NCT / Tools Off) WSL is a little bit harder to notice and focus on when it pops up so late \\nand without predictor.\\n(NCT / Tools Off) I find myself staring when they get close to where the WSL activates \\nand I'm spending too much time guessing where the AC will be in relation to active WSL. \\nThis is mitigated by preview WSL.\\n(Non-NCT TRACON / DB Distance On/WSL-P Off) Not as much situational awareness as \\nwhen the gray line is active, but still doable without difficulty. --------------------------------- At the end of Day 2 (QT3), after experiencing the nominal scenarios across all IM PA Tool and \\nmonitor configurations, controllers were asked if it was helpful to know whether an aircraft \\nwould eventually require an active WSL. Responses are shown for all TRACON (NCT and non-\\nNCT combined) and Tower Only. Response Means and Standard Deviations are summarized in \\nTable 5-41. Scale responses are shown in Figure 5-50.
