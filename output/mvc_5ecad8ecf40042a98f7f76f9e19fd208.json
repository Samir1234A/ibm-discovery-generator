Generally an instrument approach is still entered as a backup an ILS approach at most runways. By analyzing the downlinked approach procedure with respect to trajectory data and associated metrics within MITRE CAASDs Threaded Track Flight Story (TTFS), it is possible to estimate whether an ILS is actually being flown vs. a visual approach. Length of the flown downwind leg and descending flight path angle are both computed in the TTFS system and were used to separate likely visual approaches from likely instrument approaches. Figure 3-6 demonstrates this process at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (KATL), with likely ILS approaches (as per the plan in downlink) in red, likely visual approaches in blue, and unknown in gray. Likely visual approaches accounted for 52% of the flight tracks evaluated, while 31% are unknown, and 16% are likely ILS approaches. Given the prevalence of Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC), an extension of this analysis to all airports would likely put visual approaches as the most used in Figure 3-4. 3-12 \\nFigure 3-6 Identifying Visual Approaches at KATL Runway 26R 3.2.2 Special Procedure Usage The Flight Standards Flight Technologies and Procedures Division (AFS-400) is responsible for approving use of special, non-public procedures, including both operator- and FAA-designed approaches. A robust FMS downlink architecture would enable more routine monitoring and analysis of special approach procedure utilization, which could benefit the airlines by providing a more analytic justification for evolving procedure design criteria. The FAA would benefit from monitoring performance on special procedures; successful implementation of a special procedure with non-standard criteria may help justify evolution of criteria. Additionally, special procedure utilization and performance data could support FAA annual or biannual review, which is often required for conditional waivers and special procedure approvals. Figure 3-7 shows the planned approaches in FMS downlink data for KJFK arrivals. The majority of arrivals on Runway 13L are planned for the RNAV (RNP) special approach. 3-13 Figure 3-7: KJFK Planned Approach Type in FMS at Downlink Time, by Runway. MITRE CAASD has deployed a capability in the AFS Data Analytics Prototype for AFS-400 to analyze usage patterns for RNP approach procedures with Radius-to-Fix (RF) legs. The AFS Data Analytics Prototype capabilities enable analysis of fused operational usage metrics (e.g., arrival procedure usage), aircraft performance metrics (e.g., climb gradient distributions, final approach deviations), and weather conditions at various points of interest in the National Airspace System (NAS). The RNP approach usage capability has been subsequently tailored to monitor usage of several special RNP procedures, including the special RNP approach for Runway 13L (shown in Figure 3-8). \\nFigure 3-8: JFK 13L Special RNAV (RNP) Procedure Usage Delta Air Lines Downlink Samples. Figure 3-9 shows sample Delta Air Lines track data in 2017 that was detected by conformance algorithms as using the JFK 13L RNP approach. The charts show the conformance trend over 3-14 time and the conforming aircraft types. MITRE CAASD is now able to use Delta Air Lines downlink data to validate the track data conformance monitoring algorithm, though data lag prevented the analysis from being possible prior to publication. \\nFigure 3-9: AFS Data Analytics Prototype: JFK 13L Special RNAV (RNP) Conformance Monitoring More importantly, for special approaches that do not have distinct lateral or vertical paths from published approaches, downlink data would enable measuring usage and conformance. This would enable reporting metrics similar to the one in Figure 3-9 for all approach procedures. 3.3 Downlink Timing Analyses This section describes the timing of the downlink with respect to arrival time, and explores reasons that the downlink route may not reflect the ultimately executed flight plan. If the in- range downlink trigger is too early, the downlink information could be inaccurate due to a Flight Plan route change prior to execution of the approach. The pilot may not have yet checked, via Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) or communication with Air Traffic Control, for available and unavailable approaches at the airport. ATC also may clear for a different arrival runway or approach type than originally planned based on changing traffic features or weather conditions. 3.3.1 Time/Altitude at Downlink Figure 3-10 shows the time from arrival and flight altitude distributions for downlink messages received from Delta Air Lines. The distributions are fairly wide, but centered in the vicinity of typical Top of Descent (TOD) points, when the aircraft is still in en route airspace and 40 minutes from the arrival airport. The location of downlinks received for JFK arrivals is shown in Figure 3-11 and also highlights the significant variation in distance from airport. As discussed in Section 2.4, there are no timing requirements on the in-range downlink call generally the crew will perform this action when convenient, during the arrival briefing. Follow-on work may include working with Delta Air Lines and other airlines to improve the automated trigger mechanism by sending the message closer to arrival. For example, one possibility is to trigger the message downlink when the landing gear or flaps are lowered on final approach. At this point, flights are established on the approach and only a go around or an abnormal event would cause the flight to deviate from what is programmed in the FMS. 3-15 \\nFigure 3-10. Time from Arrival and Altitude at Downlink Time 3-16 \\nFigure 3-11. Locations of KJFK Arrivals at Downlink Time, by Runway 3.3.2 Runway/Route Changes in Downlinks Figure 3-12 shows the frequency of flights with multiple downlink messages in the dataset 8% of the flights have more than one downlink. Only 1.1% have a runway or approach procedure change, and most of these are runway changes only 0.3% of flights in the downlink sample had a change in approach procedure without a change in planned arrival runway. As such, using the downlink data provided by Delta Air Lines could result in procedure usage assignment errors as clearances change post-downlink. Note, the trigger mechanism used by Delta Air Lines does not 3-17 automate a downlink upon planned route change, so these percentages likely underestimate the actual frequency of planned runway or approach changes. Improvements to the trigger mechanism, such as making the trigger later in the flight path, could reduce the number of runway and procedure changes after the downlink. \\nFigure 3-12. Frequency of Multiple Downlink Messages and Route Changes Figure 3-13 shows the top ten most common changes in approach procedures in the downlink dataset. Arrivals to KJFK 22L switched from ILS to VOR/DME approaches twelve times in the sample dataset. The other most common approach changes were due to a change in the planned arrival runway. \\nFigure 3-13. Most Frequent Planned Approach Procedure Changes 3-18 3.4 TTFS Analysis of Flights with Downlinks In order to better characterize accuracy of the intent information within downlinks, the Delta Air Lines downlink dataset was fused to available TTFS trajectory data and associated metrics. TTFS is a analytic product which fuses all available surveillance sources for a given aircraft to provide a single trajectory and associated flight performance metrics. TTFS enables higher fidelity analysis for safety, aircraft performance, criteria and standards, benefits, and operational performance reporting. This section reinforces the limitations of the in-range call as a trigger mechanism for downlink, specifically the inability to track planned runway and approach changes that occur well after TOD. 3.4.1 Downlink Time compared to TOD TOD is estimated via trajectory analysis algorithmically in the TTFS data process [6]. Flights in the downlink data were joined to TTFS flights based on flight metadata (e.g., callsign). Figure 3-14 shows a comparison of TOD time to the time of latest downlink for a given flight. The wide distribution indicates that the in-range call varies significantly with respect to TOD, and often comes prior to TOD. 3-19 Figure 3-14. TOD Time Compared to Downlink Time 3.4.2 Runway Changes After Downlinks With flight plan route messages often downlinked prior to TOD, the next analysis evaluated whether this significantly impacts accuracy of the planned runway and approach in the downlink messages. For this analysis, we compared arrival runway assignments in TTFS, algorithmically determined based on trajectory alignment to arrival runways just before touchdown, to the planned arrival runways in Delta Air Lines downlink messages. Figure 3-15 shows the top airports in the downlink dataset, with flight counts for which the runway assignment in TTFS matched the planned runway in downlink message (blue) and flight counts for which the runway assignment did not match the downlink message (red). The larger airports have a substantial proportion of flights that landed on a different runway than the in-range downlink indicated, including KATL, where approximately 40% of flights landed on a different runway than was planned in the downlink. 3-20 \\nFigure 3-15. Runway Changes (based on trajectories) After Downlink Message Figure 3-16 shows the most frequent differences between the planned runway in downlink message and the trajectory-based runway assignment.
