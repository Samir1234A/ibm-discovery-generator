The High-Performance Cycle Source: Locke & Latham, 2002 15 Research has also identified the following best practices to achieve high performance: Set agency, group, and individual goals that align with each other. Assign goals that are viewed by employees as challenging, specific, actionable, \\nmeasurable, and time-bound. Ensure that employees are committed to the goals and perceive that they have the \\ncapability (such as resources and skills) to achieve the goals. Provide feedback regarding progress towards goal achievement. Provide incentives and rewards that align with desired performance. Table 1 expands on these best practices and gives examples of their application to Payment \\nIntegrity. Table 1. Summary of Key Motivational Factors for Individuals An Individuals Motivation to Perform a Task is Enhanced When: Application to Payment Integrity A challenging, specific, actionable, measurable, time-bound goal is set; the goal can be an individual goal, group goal, or both Set challenging yet achievable goals for specific types of improper \\npayments to break down the problem into manageable units. Set a combination of group and individual goals to encourage teamwork \\nand sharing of lessons learned while retaining individual accountability. The individual is committed to the goal \\n Goals can be set with employees participation or can be assigned by management; both methods are effective as long as employees are \\ncommitted to the goal. Set achievable goals and ensure transparency about the goals in order \\nto increase goal commitment. Set both group and individual goals to increase goal commitment. \\nThe individual has high self-efficacy (confidence that the task can be carried out) Ensure that employees: Understand how to perform their job and minimize improper payments. \\n Possess the necessary skills and resources. \\n Are encouraged and rewarded when achieving high performance. Feedback regarding goal progress is provided \\n Provide regular, transparent, clear updates about individual employees or work units goal progress; regular feedback oriented towards the \\nprocess permits employees to make timely adjustments to their \\nstrategies rather than waiting until the end of the task or period to do so \\nbased on outcome feedback. Celebrate milestones and other significant successes. \\n Relate / link individual success to program level goals. \\n Show employees the positive impact of reaching their goals, such as more program dollars to help those who need help as opposed to \\ntaking money away from someone. Incentives or rewards for performance (not organizational goal achievement) are given Seek employee input on non-monetary incentives / rewards they prefer. \\n Ensure linkage between performance and performance rating. \\n Ensure that rewards are given for tasks / goals that are under the employees control; use group performance rewards for inter-\\ndependent tasks / organization-wide goal achievement. 16 An Individuals Motivation to Perform a Task is Enhanced When: Application to Payment Integrity The goal is seen as important by the individual Communicate how improper payments impact the agencys budget and \\nthus the agencys ability to accomplish its mission. Make the need to reduce / minimize improper payments part of the \\nagencys mission statement. Ensure that supervisors reinforce the linkage between the individuals / \\nteams work and the agency mission. Show how ensuring Payment Integrity has benefited the agencys \\ncustomers by sharing anecdotes or specific cases. Appropriate task strategies are discovered for completing complex tasks Set aside time for designated employees to pursue new strategies, share \\nsuccesses, and maintain awareness of new strategies (such as through \\nattending conferences or assessing improper payment reduction actions \\nby other agencies). Reward them for trying new strategies; ask them what they learned. \\n Encourage risk taking via setting learning goals, rather than performance goals, when employees are trying new strategies. Source: MITRE Analysis Research supports the view that, compared to the private sector, the ability to motivate \\npublic sector employees is constrained. One researcher put it this way: the public-sector \\nwork context may find it easier to constrain employees from doing anything wrong than to \\nmotivate them to do something right. [emphasis added] Constraints often impact public \\nsector motivation in the following ways. Public sector managers are constrained in their ability to provide rewards that are \\ncontingent on performance. Managers are also constrained in their ability to \\nincrease compensation as an employees skills and experience increase. As a result, \\npublic sector employees perceive a weaker relationship between extrinsic rewards \\n(pay, job security) and performance than do private-sector employees. Goals are often more ambiguous, vague, and conflicting than in the private sector. As \\na result, employees receive less feedback and are less certain that they have \\nachieved their job-level goals, as compared to the private sector. It also is difficult \\nfor employees to understand what contributions they have made and to make their \\ncontributions known. The existence of extensive rules and bureaucracyred tapecan hinder goal \\nachievement. Further, goal commitmenta critical foundation block of goal achievementcan be low \\nwhen the wrong behavior is unintentionally rewarded. Numerous public sector examples \\nexist of organizations that reward A while hoping for B. For example, agencies often \\nreward spending all of the money budgeted for a particular program, while at the same \\ntime hoping for prudent spending. Instead, rewards and recognition should overtly \\nreinforce all types of desired behavior. 17 Although the private sectors ability to provide large salary increases, bonuses, or stock \\noptions does not exist in the public sector, agencies can still effectively recognize and \\nreward employees. Agencies have the authority to design extensive incentive and \\nrecognition programs that include providing awards to federal employees to recognize \\nspecific individual and group performance. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \\nguidance provides for a wide range of types of incentives and recognition, including the \\nfollowing which could be used in conjunction with reducing improper payments. Formal rewards o Cash incentive and recognition awards programs o Quality step increases o Time off Informal recognition o A sincere Thank you! given to the employee at agency events or meetings, or \\nindividually via personal visits or notes posted on the employees door or cubicle o Recognition in agency blogs or tweets, in newsletters, or with certificates of \\nappreciation Outside groups can also recognize outstanding work. For example, the Baltimore Federal \\nExecutive Board has recognized outstanding regional employees for more than 40 years. \\nEmployees are honored in an annual award ceremony and luncheon attended by over \\n1,000 federal officials, employees, and guests. Further, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) recommends providing regular \\nfeedback and recognition and closely linking recognition and rewards to performance. \\nMSPB reinforces the point that no single factor or action will result in dramatic, sustainable \\nimprovements in an agencys performance; instead, a comprehensive, multi-faceted effort \\nmust be undertaken. Agency officials offered various views on motivating employees in relation to Payment \\nIntegrity. Officials at one agency believe their employees are motivated by an attitude of \\npublic service, in particular \\\"getting the biggest bang for the buck\\\" for the intended \\nbeneficiaries of their programs. That bang is dependent on spending the budgeted funds \\non the right beneficiaries. While employees may not necessarily think overtly of \\npreventing improper payments, officials acknowledged the need to prevent over-\\npayments or payments to ineligible recipients in order to maximize the funds available for \\nintended beneficiaries. Conversely, underpayments mean people or entities that are \\nentitled to benefits are not receiving all of the benefits allowed. Officials at another agency suggested that the nature of the work at some agencies makes it \\neasier for them to motivate their employees than for other agencies to do so. For example, \\nthey believed it is easier to motivate employees when they process transactions like \\\"case \\nworkers\\\"personally handling the details of each transaction. On the other hand, if \\nautomated systems largely process the transactions, then these officials believed it is 18 harder to motivate individual employees by appealing to the spirit of public service \\nbecause the employees feel more distant from the recipient of the payment or benefit. 2.3 Recommendations OMB and agencies can fundamentally transform the entire system by implementing the \\nfollowing recommendations in order to create the conditions for optimal Payment \\nIntegrity. 1. Affirm a Culture of Payment Integrity. Senior Executive Branch leadership needs \\nto demonstrate a government-wide focus on the importance of Payment Integrity\\na tone at the top that is emphasized on a regular basis,18 is enhanced in peer-to-\\npeer relationships within agencies, and permeates throughout the agencies. \\nPayment Integrity needs to be important to everyone. a. Consider a government-wide CAP Goal for Payment Integrity. b. Ensure there is a line of sight from agency improper payments goals through \\ncomponent goals, to the performance standards of executives, managers, and \\nfront line employees. Ensure employees understand the relationships between \\nagency improper payment goals and their own job goalshow their job impacts \\nagency-level goals. c. Include Payment Integrity as a factor in ratings and awards. Providing \\nemployees with regular feedback and recognition regarding improper payments \\nprevention and reduction, along with closely linking recognition and rewards to \\nperformance, can motivate them towards success in this area. d. Recognizeformally and informallyindividuals at both agency- and \\ngovernment-wide levels for superior achievement in meeting improper payment",
