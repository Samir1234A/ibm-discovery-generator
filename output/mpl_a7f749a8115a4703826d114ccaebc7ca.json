  "sdl_extracted_summary": "\\ninform controllers when a lateral deviation occurred and IM PA needed to be terminated. \\nControllers found it useful and offered suggestions to increase its saliency. Most controllers reported a Final Monitor controller is the most appropriate position to monitor \\nIM PA operations, though this may ultimately depend on the facility. They also expressed a \\nstrong preference to provide speeds manually to the IM Trail Aircraft when they observed a \\nspacing situation start to develop. However, the practicality of this may depend on whether a \\nFinal Approach controller or dedicated Monitor controller is providing separation within and \\nbetween IM PA pairs. Controller manual PA speed management must be balanced with the \\npotential for undesirable frequency overrides and workload, which may make it highly \\nchallenging to implement. With respect to the experiments secondary goal to evaluate the IM PA initiation task, controller \\nparticipants on average agreed Final controllers: can acceptably initiate the IM PA operation; \\ncan acceptably ensure separation during IM PA operations before transferring aircraft to the \\nLocal controller given the appropriate training and tools; and were comfortable with the IM \\nTrail Aircraft managing speed to achieve the spacing goal. However, concerns were raised \\nregarding the phraseology, available CSL and WSL information at the time of initiation, and the \\navailable time and airspace to perform the initiation task as simulated. Overall results suggest given the appropriate tools and training, the IM PA longitudinal and \\nlateral separation monitoring and initiation tasks should be acceptable to controllers. In a \\nrelated IM PA flight deck features evaluation performed in 2018, pilots also found IM PA to be \\ngenerally acceptable, even after experiencing significant lateral deviations by the Lead Aircraft. \\nThe current IM PA concept appears feasible and MITRE CAASD recommends the FAA continue \\nits development. vi\\n This study provided initial findings on the initiation and monitoring of an IM PA operation. The \\nresults are intended to provide concept validation for the avionics standard development \\nactivities and A-IM Concept of Operations, as well as specific recommendations for the FAA IM \\nInitial Program Requirements document with respect to controller information needs and \\nsupporting ground tools. These results and recommendations should be considered by RTCA SC-\\n186, FAA SBS Program Office, FAA Aircraft Certification, and FAA Flight Standards as IM PA \\nproceeds through concept maturation. vii\\n Acknowledgments\\nThis research was sponsored by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Surveillance and \\nBroadcast Services (SBS) Program Office (AJM-432).

The atmospheric drag was estimated by: = 12 qG\\nCp) ( Figure 2-12 Atmospheric Drag Torque Equation Like SRP, when the center of atmospheric pressure, determined by the spacecraft area exposed to the atmosphere in the direction of the orbital velocity (i.e. ram direction), is not aligned with the center of mass, a torque occurs. The density of air is estimated using an upper atmospheric model derived by NASA: = 131.21 + .00299 = 2.488 + 273.1216.6 |.~}} q = .2869 + 273.1 Figure 2-13 Upper Atmospheric Air Model Equations [8] The drag coefficient was estimated at a constant 2.2 (as is common practice for a LEO flying satellite). The ram area was calculated for the worst-case scenario by determining the largest area of all the sides. Lastly, the maximum distance from the aerodynamic center of pressure to the center of mass was calculated. 2.10.4.4 Magnetic Torque Calculation The Earths liquid core is a dynamo that induces a magnetic field. This magnetic field is strong enough to generate effects on the space surrounding Earth, so strong in fact that it ! = = 7 !5 7 q = # $ = ^/7 \\n 4 = 4$$# 7 = = 7 = 78 ` = ` 78 = =#7 5 4# 7 7 = 4# $ ] 7 ! = !7 5 ) = 5 ^ = # $ ^/7 2-23 interacts with the satellites weak magnetic residual moment. When the satellites residual moment is not aligned to the local magnetic field from Earth, the satellite experiences a magnetic torque that attempts to align the two. The magnitude of this magnetic torque can be calculated using the equation presented in Figure 2-14. = At = A K~ Figure 2-14 Magnetic Torque Equation This equation models the Earths magnetic field as a dipole. The spacecrafts dipole moment is assumed to be 1 for a small, uncompensated spacecraft. Earths magnetic constant is estimated at 7.18 10\\u007f Tm~. Lastly, lambda is a unitless function of the magnetic latitude that ranges from 1 \\nat the magnetic equator to 2 at the magnetic poles. 2.10.4.5 Gravity-Gradient Torque Calculation The final torque requiring computation was the gravity-gradient torque. Gravity-gradient torques arise when the spacecrafts center of gravity is not aligned with its center of mass with respect to the local vertical. The gravity-gradient torque increases as a function of the angle between the local vertical and the spacecrafts principal axes with the gravity-gradient torque always trying to align the minimum principal axis with the local vertical. Figure 2-15 provides a simplified equation for the gravity-gradient torque for a spacecraft with the minimum principal axis in its Z- direction is shown below.

To determine the mass of a reaction wheel, data was collected on several commercially available reaction wheels. With the data gathered in MATLAB, a fourth-order polynomial curve was fit to the data to compare the momentum storage capabilities of the reaction wheels and their weight in kilograms. From the polynomial curve, an approximate mass was selected based off the momentum storage capabilities. 2.10.4.7 ACS Propulsion Sizing The ACS propulsion sizing requires five inputs: the mass of the spacecraft, the center of gravity, satellite lifetime, the saturation point of a reaction wheel (secular angular momentum), and the rate of saturation of a reaction wheel. These were used to compute the momentum dumping fuel mass required over the satellite lifetime and the thrust required for a single momentum dump. Although the proposed design includes four thrusters for momentum dumping and one main thruster, this code utilizes six thrusters (one on each side) and chooses the shortest moment arm which will require the largest thrust to design for the worst-case scenario. The author assumed that the thruster required for momentum dumping will fire for one second. With the worst-case moment arm calculated, the thrust required to dump the momentum is calculated (per pulse) using the following equation. = > Figure 2-16 Thrust Per Momentum Dump Equation ! = cd c# !5 7 = cd # 4# # 7/ \\n = # \\n 4# 7 \\n ; = ]7# $ ;# &5 ^ 78 \\n ; = ]7# $ ;# &5 ^ 78 \\n < = =# & # ` # = ! = !5 = 3 ]7# 57 7/ \\n \\\" = !5 ]7# =7 7 \\n = F5# !7 2-25 The propellant mass required for ACS over the satellite lifetime is then calculated with these equations. Z\\\\ = 3 >Ov 365.25. O (MZ\\\\ = Z\\\\ .L Z\\\\ is the total number of thruster firings required throughout the lifetime of the spacecraft \\nto ensure that the reaction wheels can control the attitude of the spacecraft. The numerator of the first equation in Figure 2-17 has a factor of 3 because three reaction wheels will need to be desaturated each time a momentum dump is required. Lastly, since hydrazine was selected as the fuel of choice, the .L is 218 seconds. \\n2.10.4.8 ACS Model Outputs This completes the ACS model process. In the Command Window of MATLAB, the following items are printed: cyclical angular momentum per orbit, secular angular momentum per orbit, reaction wheel mass, the fuel required for momentum dumping, and the thrust required per momentum dump. In addition, a polar graph showing the individual and total torques over the entire orbit is displayed.

A publicly available special purpose model was selected due to its free nature. While SME: The New SMAD [1] presents several publicly available special purpose cost 2-27 estimating models, the SSCM is selected because of its usefulness in pricing spacecraft weighing less than 500 kg. Developed by The Aerospace Corporation, it is assumed that these cost estimating relationships (CERs) include the cost of contractor program management, systems engineering, product assurance, and I&T. The equations used to determine the CERS are shown below, and FY10 dollars have been adjusted to FY18 when utilized.
