  "text": "made available or \\nremoved from the display, depending on the scenario. This was intended to examine whether \\nthey were helpful or necessary for the controller IM PA monitoring task. The other IM PA tools \\nsuch as the IM Spacing List, IM Status, CSL/WSL Lines, Alerts, and Lateral Boundaries features \\nwere fixed. These were always available to participants, for every scenario. Day 3 for each session included a self-contained evaluation of the longitudinal alert timing \\nvalues. As described in Section 4.2.7, the default Predictive / Caution alert timings were the \\nsame as those implemented for ATPA: 45 seconds and 24 seconds, respectively. However, \\nreduced timings may ultimately be used to mitigate against nuisance alerts (which would occur \\nmore frequently with greater timings). Therefore, two additional alert timings were investigated \\nin the HITL to examine whether lower alert timings than those chosen for ATPA remain \\nacceptable to controllers for the IM PA monitoring task. These were: 35 seconds / 20 seconds \\nand 25 seconds / 15 seconds, for the Predictive and Caution Alerts, respectively. To create a \\nmore stressing condition, these scenarios only evaluated alert timing in the context of the \\nCombined Monitor configuration. However, all of the IM PA-related tools described previously \\nwere available to the Combined Monitor controller for these scenarios. Day 3 also took an initial look at lateral monitoring with deviations as a self-contained xxxv\\n evaluation in the afternoon. This included determining to what degree will controllers want to \\ndetect developing deviations before a Lateral Boundary is crossed, whether a 4:1 aspect ratio \\nFMA display is needed, especially with only an Exceedance Warning (no Lateral Predictive Alert) \\nwith a tighter Lateral Boundary size (ILS versus 500 ft), and how task acceptability was affected \\nby Combined versus Separate Monitor positions. Therefore, the Independent Variables for this \\nportion of the experiment included display type (STARS versus FMA) and the number of Monitor \\ncontrollers (Combined versus Separate). All of the IM PA-related tools described previously \\nwere available to the Monitor controllers for these scenarios. Traffic File Attributes5.5.5\\nThree general types of scenario traffic files were developed for the HITL, one for each type of \\nscenario. These included: 1) Nominal scenarios, 2) Alert Timing scenarios, and 3) Lateral \\nDeviation scenarios. Depending on what was being tested, these traffic files may have contained \\neither of two types of off-nominal events: Spacing Loss and Lateral Deviation. A Spacing Loss occurred when an IM Trail Aircraft began to encroach on one of the \\nsafety limits, triggering an alert. When this occurred, the controller procedures varied \\ndepending on if it was a Predictive Alert or a Caution Alert. \\nA Lateral Deviation occurred when during the IM PA operation, one aircraft sharply \\ndeviates from its approach path, either to the left or right, and keeps going; or, one \\naircraft starts a long, shallow deviation to the left or right. In this instance, the controller \\nfollowed the procedures for lateral deviations discussed. These only apply to aircraft in IM PA pairings, though loss-of-separation could occur between \\nnon-IM PA aircraft as well. None of these cases were intentionally introduced, however. The traffic file attributes for each type of scenario are summarized in the following sections. Nominal Scenarios5.5.5.1\\nFour nominal core traffic files approximately 20 minutes in length. Each had seven IM PA \\npairings, five with WSL and two without WSL. There were two non-paired SRS aircraft. There \\nwere two Spacing Loss events per scenario; one was an IM PA Predictive Alerts that was \\nintended to resolve without controller intervention being required. The second was an IM PA \\nPredictive Alert that led to a Caution Alert if the controller did not intervene. Given the scenario \\ntimeframe, these occurred at a higher frequency than would be experienced in actual \\noperations to provide controllers with concentrated experience in dealing with them and to get \\nfeedback on the alerting. These core traffic files were then cloned and varied in which aircraft experienced the Predictive \\nand Caution Alerts, the location of SRS aircraft within the flow, with respect to the IM PA \\npairings, the order of the IM PA pairings, and the aircraft call signs. Alert Timing Scenarios5.5.5.2\\nThe Alert Timing scenarios were based on the nominal scenario and was approximately 20 \\nminutes in duration, with six IM PA pairings. All pairs required a WSL and five of the six parings \\nwere manipulated to show an alert related to Spacing Loss. The same traffic file was used for \\neach run so participants could clearly isolate the effect of each alert timing set. xxxvi\\n A CSL alert can be triggered either earlier in the approach, or later. A WSL alert can only be \\ntriggered late, when the WSL is active. The distribution of the alerts in the scenario is shown in \\nTable 4-3. Table 4-3. Distribution of CSL and WSL Alerts in the Scenario Pair 1 Pair 2 Pair 3 Pair 4 Pair 5 Pair 6\\nEarly Late Early Late Early Late Early Late Early Late Early Late\\nCSL WSL CSL WSL CSL Lateral Deviation Scenarios5.5.5.3\\nEach Lateral Deviation scenario lasted for approximately 10 minutes and included four IM PA \\npairings, two of which exhibited Lateral Deviations that required the controller to take action. \\nThere were three potential lateral deviation variables considered in the scenario design. First, \\nthe deviating aircraft could be either be the IM Lead or IM Trail Aircraft. Second, the deviation \\nangle could be sharp or shallow. A sharp deviation occurs suddenly, with little warning. A \\nshallow deviation evolves gradually, over a long portion of the approach. And third, the \\ndeviation could either be inboard (toward the other aircraft) or outboard (away from the other \\naircraft). Based on the lateral deviation variables, two deviation types were developed: Deviation Type A: Lead / Sharp (30 deg) / Inboard.\\nDeviation Type B: Trail / Shallow (10 deg) / Outboard. A lateral deviation could also occur earlier or later in the approach. Therefore, four traffic files \\nwere developed for the Lateral Deviation scenarios. Variations included deviation location \\n(earlier versus later), deviation order (whether Type A occurred before Type B, or whether Type \\nB occurred before Type A), and which of the four IM PA pairings experienced them. Table 4-4 \\nshows the how the variations were implemented and distributed across each of the four traffic \\nfiles (named L through O). Table 4-4. Distribution of Lateral Deviation Types Pair 1 Pair 2 Pair 3 Pair 4\\nTraffic File 10 NM 5 NM 10 NM 5 NM 10 NM 5 NM 10 NM 5 NM L A B\\nM B A\\nN A B\\nO B A These lateral deviation events occurred at a far higher frequency than would be experienced \\nin actual operations. This was intended to provide controllers with concentrated \\nexperience in dealing with them to get feedback on the lateral monitoring display \\nfeatures. It should also be noted that the scenario presented in the scenario that \\ninvolved traffic file O was deliberately designed as an extreme case. The timing of this \\nscenario was such that that the shallow-deviating Trail crossed its Lateral Boundary and \\ntriggered its Exceedance Warning shortly after the Lead Aircraft (of a different pair) \\ntriggered its Exceedance Warning. In effect, this appeared to controllers as a near-\\nsimultaneous lateral deviation of two aircraft. In real world operations, a near- xxxvii\\n simultaneous lateral deviation of multiple aircraft on CSPR is expected to occur rarely, if \\nat all. An investigation of over 1.8 million approach paths did not detect any (Eckstein, \\nMassimini, McNeill, & Niles, 2012), nor was there a record of any in an examination of \\n7790 go-arounds that were logged over multiple years by NCT (Stassen, Domino, Hefley, \\n& Weitz, 2019). Though this has never been observed in real world operations, it was still \\nincluded in the simulation to stress the display features and probe for a potential failure \\npoint with IM PA Tools or Monitoring configuration. Scenario Matrices and Run Orders5.5.6\\nThis section describes the scenario matrices across the three weeks of runs. Some changes were \\nmade after the Week 1 scenarios were run, so they are described separately from the Week 2-3 \\nscenarios. The data reduction and analysis process accounted for those differences. The Day 1-2 scenarios were considered nominal operations. Though some longitudinal \\nSpacing Loss events were included, the alert timing values were fixed, and no deliberate Lateral \\nDeviations were introduced. As noted in Section 4.5.3, two controllers participated per run \\nwhile the other two filled out their post-run questionnaires. When the Combined Monitor \\nconfiguration was evaluated, one participant controller served as the Monitor and the other \\nserved as the 28R Final controller. When the Separate Monitor configuration was run, one \\nparticipant served as the 28L Monitor controller and the other served as the 28R Monitor \\ncontroller. The 28R Final controller position was not staffed in these cases, and IM PA pairs were \\ninitiated via the simulation before they were turned over to the Local controller. The scenario order for each day was counterbalanced across the three weeks. The monitor \\nconfigurations were alternated by run week. The daily simulation topic by week is summarized \\nin Table 4-5. Table 4-5. Daily Simulation Topic",
