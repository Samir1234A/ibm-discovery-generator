Here we \\ndocumented the results of our research, comparing security characteristics included in the \\nISM, Essential Eight, and privacy guidelines, to the Practice Guide. We stated how the \\nPractice Guide aligns with Australian mobile device security standards and guidelines as \\nwell as gave recommendations for tailoring it for the needs of Australian organizations. 3.1 Assumptions \\nThis report refers to Australian organizations generally, but it is most applicable to small and \\nmedium enterprises. For the purposes of this research, an SME may follow either the Australian \\nTax Office definition of an entity with less than AU$10 million in yearly turnover, and less than \\na large business with turnover of more than AU$250 million; or the Australian Bureau of \\nStatistics definition of a business employing fewer than 20 people [17]. Also, this report uses the \\nNIST definition of a mobile device as having the following characteristics [18]: a small form factor \\n11 at least one wireless network interface for network access (data communications). This \\ninterface uses Wi-Fi, cellular networking, or other technologies that connect the mobile \\ndevice to network infrastructures with connectivity to the internet or other data networks local, built-in (nonremovable) data storage an operating system that is not a full-fledged desktop or laptop operating system applications available through multiple methods (provided with the mobile device, \\naccessed through web browser, acquired and installed from third parties) This report refers to the cloud and hybrid reference architectures described within the Practice \\nGuide. The cloud architecture is geared toward smaller organizations wanting to operate and \\nmaintain systems external to their enterprise environment to lower operational expenses. The \\nhybrid architecture is meant for more mature organizations that are concerned with the risks \\nassociated with storing and processing confidential enterprise information in the cloud. Each \\ndocumented architecture is based on a set of security characteristics that are required to mitigate \\nin large part the risks of storing enterprise data on mobile devices and transmitting enterprise \\ndata to and from mobile devices. The identified security characteristics are data protection, data \\nisolation, monitoring, identity and authorization, and privacy [19]. These characteristics are \\nspecifically crafted to address the unique mobile security environment rather than general IT \\nsecurity. \\nFor this project, MITRE focused on standards and guidelines most broadly relevant to Australian \\nentities that use mobile devices as tools to conduct business. An exhaustive mapping of all \\ndocuments that may affect any Australian organization is beyond the scope of this document. Identified Laws, Standards, and Guidelines \\nIn this report, the term laws refers to binding rules that are required for applicable entities. \\nStandards establish specifications to ensure reliability and consistency, while guidelines provide \\noptional information or advice [20]. There is some overlap between standards and guidelines. \\nDocuments that function as optional guidelines for some entities may be considered standards for \\nanother in the sense that they are used to measure compliance to mandates. Deciphering \\ncybersecurity-related laws, standards, and guidelines is a significant challenge for SMEs. It is \\nfurther complicated by the fact that guidelines produced by government agencies across the \\nfederal and state levels are often inconsistent, which could be confusing for industry. \\nMITRE researched Australian laws, standards, and guidelines to identify those with specific \\napplication to mobile device security. General, government, and privacy items that were \\nreviewed are listed in the following table. A description of each regulation or standard and how it \\ndoes or does not apply to mobile device security is provided in the narrative following the table. \\nEach of the documents in the following table was deemed to be potentially relevant for mobile \\ndevice security implementations in Australia. Our analysis describes each law, standard, and \\nguideline and then briefly explains whether it is sufficiently important to be selected for detailed \\nmapping against the Practice Guide. \\n12 Table 1Cybersecurity Laws, Standards, and Guidelines Name Type Issuing Authority Source Cyber Security for \\nContractors Guidelines \\n(standard for \\nfederal \\ngovernment) Australian Signals \\nDirectorate https://www.asd.gov.au/publication\\ns/protect/Cyber_Security_for_Contr\\nactors.pdf Cybercrime Act 2001 Law Australian Parliament \\nhttps://www.legislation.gov.au/Det\\nails/C2004C01213 Essential Eight Guidelines \\n(standard for \\nfederal \\ngovernment) Australian Signals \\nDirectorate https://www.asd.gov.au/publication\\ns/protect/essential-eight-\\nexplained.htm ISO 27001/2 Standard \\nInternational \\nOrganization for \\nStandardization https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-\\ninformation-security.html Framework for \\nImproving Critical \\nInfrastructure \\nCybersecurity Guidelines NIST https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework Risk Management of \\nEnterprise Mobility, \\nIncluding Bring Your \\nOwn Device Guidelines Australian Signals Directorate https://www.asd.gov.au/publication\\ns/protect/enterprise_mobility_bring\\n_your_own_device_byod.htm Strategies to Mitigate \\nCyber Security \\nIncidents Guidelines Australian Signals Directorate \\nhttps://www.asd.gov.au/infosec/mi\\ntigationstrategies.htm Information Security \\nManual (ISM) Standard for \\nfederal \\ngovernment Australian Signals \\nDirectorate https://www.asd.gov.au/infosec/is\\nm/ Information Security \\nManagement \\nGuidelines: Risk \\nmanagement of \\noutsourced ICT \\narrangements \\n(including Cloud) Standard for \\nfederal \\ngovernment Australian \\nGovernment https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.\\nau/informationsecurity/Documents/\\nAustralianGovernmentInformationS\\necurityManagementGuidelines.pdf Information Security \\nRegistered Assessors \\nProgram (IRAP) Standard Australian Signals Directorate https://www.asd.gov.au/publication\\ns/irap/IRAP_Policy_and_Procedures.\\npdf Protective Security \\nPolicy Framework Guidelines Australia https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.\\nau/Pages/default.aspx Privacy Amendment \\n(Notifiable Data \\nBreaches) Act 2017 Law Australian Parliament \\nhttps://www.legislation.gov.au/Det\\nails/C2017A00012 \\n13 4.1 National Laws \\nThe items listed here are federal laws and were reviewed for their potential applicability to \\nmobile device security in Australia. 4.1.1 Cybercrime Act 2001 The Cybercrime Act 2001 is a law that provides a mechanism to prosecute those who use \\ncyberspace to perpetrate crime. It defines computer offenses, addresses enforcement authority, \\nand outlines penalties for violations. While the act is of interest, it is not directly relevant to \\nimproving mobile device security as the emphasis is on hacking and computer crimes; thus, it is \\nnot included as a mapping component. 4.1.2 Privacy While the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988 (the Privacy Act) and Privacy Amendment \\n(Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 are listed individually in Table 1, they are addressed \\ntogether here under the Privacy header. \\nThe Privacy Act defines personal information and regulates how it may be handled. The Privacy \\nAct established the 13 Australian Privacy Principles (APP). It intersects with mobile devices due \\nto the myriad of transaction types and tasks conducted via mobile device, some of those actions \\nusing personal information. However, it is the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) \\nAct 2017 that is most noted when addressing mobile device security due to the potential for data \\nbreach via a mobile device. The Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 \\nestablished a mandatory data breach notification scheme in Australia. The amendment is \\napplicable to entities covered in the Privacy Act, including businesses that have an annual \\nturnover of more than AU$3 million, organizations that have Privacy Act security obligations in \\nrelation to particular types of information, and other organizations that have voluntarily opted in \\nto Privacy Act compliance [21]. \\nMITRE found that elements of the Guide to Securing Personal Information more closely align to \\nmobile device security and selected that document for mapping privacy elements rather than \\neither the Privacy Act or Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017. 4.2 Standards and Guidelines \\nMost of the material published to influence organizations cybersecurity activity fits within the \\ncategory of standards and guidelines. Although compliance with standards may be required for \\ncertain entities (e.g., federal agencies may have to comply with certain government-mandated \\nstandards), standards are typically not treated as mandates by private-sector entities. Guidelines- Privacy Act 1988 Law Australian Parliament \\nhttps://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-\\nlaw/privacy-act Guide to securing \\npersonal information Guidelines Office of the \\nAustralian \\nInformation \\nCommissioner https://www.oaic.gov.au/agencies-\\nand-organisations/guides/guide-to-\\nsecuring-personal-information \\n14 level documents are advisory; they provide recommendations and/or suggestions but are purely \\noptional. Although the terms standards and guidelines appear to be well-defined and \\ndistinctive, there is crossover, often due to procurement processes requiring applicants to \\ndemonstrate compliance with one or more standards, which creates a confusing area for \\norganizations. From its consultations with industry, MITRE learned that this contributed to some \\norganizations not taking any actions while larger organizations described using a combination of \\nstandards and guidelines documents from international and Australian sources, including the \\nNIST Cybersecurity Framework. \\nThis section provides a description of the standards and guidelines documents we deemed to be \\nrelevant to the Practice Guide. The focus below is on federal-level documents. However, as part \\nof our research we reviewed the procurement policies of each Australian state and territory. \\nWhile states do have cybersecurity requirements in their procurement policies, these policies \\napply only to those organizations that are doing business with the states. This could lead to \\nsituations where businesses trying to work with multiple states, as well as with the federal \\ngovernment, are forced to comply with a myriad of different policies. In addition, only the New \\nSouth Wales state government provided clear guidelines for entities pursuing mobile device \\nprocurement through the NSW Government Device & Application Framework. However, the \\nNSW Framework lacks a clear linkage to federal government policies. Organizations doing \\nbusiness with the multiple Australian jurisdictions need to review the procurement policy for \\neach state. This has the potential to further fragment any cybersecurity advice. The list of state \\nprocurement policies reviewed for this effort is shown in Appendix D. 4.2.1 Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents ASDs Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents provides relevant guidelines to all \\norganizations seeking methods to reduce cybersecurity incidents. Along with its companion \\ndocument Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security IncidentsMitigation Details, this ASD \\nguideline is a useful resource for Australian organizations. However, these publications focus on \\nenterprise security rather than mobile device security and already",
