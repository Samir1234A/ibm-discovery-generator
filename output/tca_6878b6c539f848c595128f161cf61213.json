  "text": "Markers\\nSlot markers have a 15-second radius for the feeder controller and a 5-second radius for the\\nfinal controller. Therefore, the absolute slot marker deviation metric can be used to determine\\nwhether aircraft were in their slot markers. Table 4-33 shows the percentage of time aircraft\\nwere in their slot markers while in the feeder and final controllers airspace. From the previous\\nsection, Figure 4-31, Figure 4-32, and Figure 4-33 show the distributions of the time deviation\\nas well as the radius of the slot markers (as the lines drawn at 5 and 15 seconds). Table 4-33. Percentage of Time Aircraft were in Slot Markers Airspace location Aircraft role IM clearance type\\nIM Trail  Both\\nachieve-by IM Trail -\\ncapture then maintain\\nIM trail  Combined Non-IM\\nFeeder 41.2 50.5 45.9 54.2\\nFinal 17.2 16.9 17.1 19.1 Overall, all aircraft were in their slot markers less often in the feeders airspace as compared to\\nthe finals airspace. IM aircraft (45.9%) were in the slot markers for less time in the feeders\\nairspace as compared to non-IM aircraft (54.2%). Both achieve-by clearance type aircraft\\n(41.2%) spent less time in their slot marker in the feeders airspace as compared to the capture\\nthen maintain aircraft (50.5%). All aircraft had similar amount of time (approximately 17.5%)\\nspent in their slot markers in the final controllers airspace. In summary, IM aircraft (particularly those flying the achieve-by clearance types) appeared to\\nspend more time outside the slot markers than non-IM aircraft in the feeder controllers sector.\\nThis is likely because the controller was working to get non-IM aircraft into their slot markers\\nprior to the handoff to the final controller, while the achieve-by aircraft were still working\\ntoward the ASG at a later point (DERVL and YOKXO) in the final controllers airspace. All aircraft 4-41 ended up spending similar amounts of time in the slot markers in the final controllers airspace.\\nAs seen with the slot marker deviation data, the final controller appeared to let aircraft run\\nahead of schedule after receiving aircraft very close to the slot marker centers. 4.5.2.3 Relative Slot Marker Deviation\\nThe relative slot marker deviation measure provides information on where the trail aircraft was\\nrelative to its slot marker based on the lead aircraft position relative to its slot marker (see\\nAppendix D for sample configurations). The relative slot marker deviation is broken into\\nconditions where the lead aircraft was either ahead of the center of the slot marker or it was\\nbehind the center of the slot marker18. The reason to examine the relative slot marker deviation\\nis to determine whether the behavior of an aircraft performing IM has an unexpected position\\nfor its own slot marker relative to the lead aircraft. The figures in this section portray the results of this measure for the various possible relative\\ntrail and lead aircraft positions. The lead aircraft is used as the reference. The figures show the\\nslot marker (scaled to the appropriate size for both feeder [15-second radius] and final [5-\\nsecond radius] controllers airspace), the mean (as a dot), and the standard deviation (as the\\ndashed bar). The figures are intended to show the relative position of the aircraft. The slot\\nmarker radius and aircraft distance from the slot marker center are to scale, but the time /\\ndistance between the slot markers is not. Additional details on the compilation of this data are\\navailable in Appendix E. Figure 4-34 and Figure 4-35 show the average relative positions of the lead and trail aircraft to\\ntheir slot markers when the lead was ahead of its slot marker center. The figures show that\\nacross all the conditions when the lead aircraft was ahead of its slot marker center, the IM trail\\naircraft was also ahead with similar variance. IM pairs and non-IM pairs also look very similar\\nacross all conditions. 18 The number of events where the lead aircraft was perfectly in the center of the slot marker (i.e., 0 deviation)\\nwere too rare to include. 4-42 Figure 4-34.

Figure 4-36. Lead and Trail Position Relative to Slot Markers When the Lead Aircraft was\\nBehind its Slot Marker Center (Feeder Airspace and Handoff) IM pair Non-IM pair Feeder\\nairspace IM pair Non-IM pair Handoff\\nto Final Direction of Travel 4-45 Figure 4-37. Lead and Trail Aircraft Position Relative to Slot Markers When the Lead Aircraft\\nwas Behind its Slot Marker Center (Final Airspace, DERVL, and YOKXO) Figure 4-36 shows (when the lead was behind the slot marker center) that the situations were\\nsimilar, but the IM aircraft pairs were often further apart than the non-IM pairs in the feeder\\nairspace and at the handoff to the final controller. Figure 4-37 shows the same was true over\\nthe course of time that the aircraft were in the final controllers airspace. However, at both\\nDERVL and YOKXO, the IM trail aircraft is also behind with similar variance. IM pairs and non-IM\\npairs also look very similar for both DERVL and YOKXO. Overall, the figures show few differences between IM and non-IM aircraft. 4.5.3 Spacing Error\\nThe following reviews the spacing error (the difference between the planned interval and the\\nachieved interval) in seconds measured at DERVL and YOKXO. For all aircraft, the planned\\ninterval was the STA of the trail aircraft minus the STA of the lead aircraft at the same point. For\\nIM aircraft, the planned interval became the ASG at the ABP. For IM aircraft the spacing error is\\na direct measure of how close the IM aircraft were to the ASG. For non-IM aircraft, it is a\\nmeasure of how well the aircraft met the planned interval. (see Appendix D for further detail).\\nFor both IM and non-IM aircraft, this is not a measure of schedule conformance. IM pair Non-IM pair\\nFinal Airspace IM pair Non-IM pair\\nDERVL IM pair Non-IM pair YOKXO Direction of Travel 4-46 Trail IM aircraft that did achieve-by only operations and those that did capture then maintain\\ndid not have a specified spacing goal at DERVL so the aircraft are excluded for measurement at\\nthat point. Those aircraft are included, along with all other aircraft for the spacing error at\\nYOKXO (also the PTP and FAF). Table 4-34 shows the spacing errors by aircraft role and\\noperation at the two points. Table 4-34.

With respect to meeting performance baseline / goal\\ndiscussed in Section 2.2.2.1, IM aircraft that achieved at DERVL met the performance goal\\n(Table 4-35). The non-IM aircraft also met their performance baseline. When aircraft reached\\nYOKXO, all aircraft had similar spacing errors, though non-IM aircraft had the largest variance.\\nAll IM aircraft and non-IM aircraft met the performance baseline / goals at YOKXO.

The blue horizontal lines in the figures show the IM performance goal of 5 seconds and\\nthe gray horizontal lines show the TSAS performance baseline of 12 seconds. Overall, IM and\\nnon-IM aircraft met the performance baseline / goals expected for the operations. Figure 4-38. Spacing Error Distribution for IM and Non-IM Aircraft at DERVL Figure 4-39.
