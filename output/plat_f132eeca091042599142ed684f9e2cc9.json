Approved for Public Release; Distribution \\nUnlimited 18-0982 \\nAll rights reserved. \\n2 Executive Summary \\nThe Australian Cyber Security Growth Network (AustCyber) contracted with The MITRE \\nCorporation (MITRE) to assess the applicability of the National Institute of Standards and \\nTechnology (NIST) Cybersecurity Practice Guide for Mobile Device Security: Cloud and Hybrid \\nBuilds (the Practice Guide) to organizations within Australia to consider opportunities for \\nstandards harmonization and proactive regulatory reform. \\nMobile devices, most frequently in the form of smartphones and tablets, are a key feature of \\nAustralias society and its business activitiessecuring those devices and the data they carry is \\ncritical. While MITRE has considered the role of government and larger enterprises in this \\nreport, considerable attention is paid to small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) due to their \\nimportant role in the Australian economy. Many of these organizations have limited operational \\nknowledge of cybersecurity. Australian organizations, and particularly SMEs, need practical \\nadvice that helps them understand their need for cybersecurity, along with easily consumable \\nguidelines that are affordable and easy to implement. \\nMITRE found that the abundance of standards and guidelines available to Australian \\norganizations at both the federal and state/territory level caused confusion around what advice \\nshould be adopted. Cyberaware organizations are overregulating, doing nothing, or applying a \\nmixture of domestic and international standards for guidelines. The result is inefficient and is a \\nbarrier to improving Australias cyber resilience. The Australian government can begin to \\naddress this issue by taking steps to harmonize the guidelines it provides to industry and other \\nlevels of Australian government. \\nThis report is a starting point for Australian government and industry to further examine the \\nexisting overlaps and gaps that Australian organizations face in following the multiple \\ncybersecurity requirements and guidelines. MITRE found that the Practice Guide is helpful to \\nAustralian organizations, including government, because it offers comprehensive standards-\\nbased guidelines. The Practice Guide attempts to provide practical, real-world security guidelines \\nthat most organizations can adopt on unclassified networks. For smaller organizations, the \\nPractice Guide focuses on the use of cloud architecture on mobile devices, while more mature \\norganizations are given guidelines on the use of hybrid architecture. \\nMITRE identified the Australian Signals Directorates (ASD) Information Security Manual \\n(ISM) and the Essential Eight mitigation strategies as having the most relevance to mobile device \\nsecurity for organizations in Australia, as well as the Office of the Australian Information \\nCommissioners (OAIC) guide to securing personal information when considering the recent \\nPrivacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017. These three resources were mapped \\nto the Practice Guide to identify overlaps and gaps. \\nOverall the ISM had the strongest relationship to the Practice Guide, and the gaps identified are \\nlargely due to the difference in the intended audience. The Practice Guide was designed for \\nindustry, whereas the ISM is focused on defense and federal agencies. The Essential Eight were \\nfound to be useful guidelines for mobile device security, with the Practice Guide security \\ncharacteristics addressing six of the eight Essential Eight strategies. The OAIC guide to securing \\n3 personal information is also relevant for SMEs concerned about mobile device security, though it \\nalso has broader applicability. \\nIn summary, our analysis showed that the Practice Guide provided useful and practical \\nguidelines on the specific issue of mobile device security within the Australian ecosystem. The \\nPractice Guide can be a useful adjunct to the existing set of Australian guidelines and could serve \\nas a preeminent and comprehensive reference for organizations seeking to improve the \\ncybersecurity of mobile devices. Furthermore, the Practice Guide could become even more \\nuseful for SMEs with several modifications described at the conclusion of this report. MITRE \\nrecommends that AustCyber, a government-funded and industry-facing independent entity, take \\nthe lead in facilitating intergovernmental and multistakeholder discussions on cybersecurity \\nstandards harmonization both domestically and internationally (the latter is especially relevant \\nfor organizations that export and/or have multinational operations), with mobile device security \\nserving as the initial use case because of its broad applicability across both SMEs and larger \\nenterprises. \\n4 Table of Contents \\n Introduction \\nICT Arrangements \\n5 Device Integrity \\n6 Introduction \\nAustralian organizations attempting to secure their cyberenvironment face a complex mix of \\nregulations, standards, and guidance. Businesses that desire to do business with governments \\nface competing standards that are recommended, if not required, by different government \\nagencies. A perceived lack of practical cybersecurity guidance has left some businesses \\nstruggling to comply with stringent security controls that exceed the level of security necessary \\nfor their environment and often with the levels of security appropriate for implementing their \\nsolutions in customer environments. \\nFurther complicating matters is the fact that the Australian economy is driven by small- and \\nmedium-size enterprises (SMEs). The criteria defining an SME varies. The Australian Bureau of \\nStatistics (ABS) defines an SME as a business employing 20 people or fewer, while the \\nAustralian Tax Office (ATO) defines a small business as an entity with less than AU$10 million \\nin yearly turnover [1] and a large business with turnover of more than AU$250 million. In fact, \\nthe Australian governments 2014 Financial System Inquiry report found that Australias two \\nmillion small- to mid-size organizations employ almost 70 percent of the total workforce and \\ncontribute half of the output of the private sector [2]. It is unrealistic to expect businesses of this \\nsize to comply with inconsistent regulations, standards, or guidance that is better suited for large \\nenterprises with dedicated IT staffs; however, the health and security of SMEs impacts not only \\nindividual businesses but government and larger corporations as well. \\nSME owners rely heavily on mobile devices to carry out key business functions. These SMEs \\nneed practical advice to help them be aware of cyber risks when interacting with mobile devices \\nand to implement guidance that will prevent, detect, and respond to cybersecurity incidents. \\nThere are some high-level cybersecurity best practices available, such as Keep your business \\nsafe from cyberthreats and the Stay Smart Online website [3][4]. Each of these online \\ngovernment resources provides valuable broad-level cybersecurity information. However, there \\nis a need for practical information for more specific business functions facing SMEs. Mobile \\ndevices, most frequently in the form of smartphones and tablets, are a key feature of Australias \\nsociety and its business activitiessecuring those devices and the data they carry is critical, yet \\nit is not clear how SMEs should best address this challenge. Mobile device cybersecurity is \\nfurther complicated by the impact of increased cloud service usage to store data that is critical to \\nbusiness operations, as highlighted in a report from the Australian Bureau of Statistics [5]. The During industry consultations, participants noted several resources that provided practical \\ncybersecurity guidance for mobile devices. The Center for Internet Security (CIS), a nonprofit \\norganization whose mission is to identify, develop, validate, promote, and sustain best-practice \\nsolutions for cyberdefense, was mentioned as a resource. The CIS produces benchmark best-\\npractice security configuration guides on many topics, including mobile devices. Other examples \\nthat were mentioned were the United Kingdoms National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) Cyber \\nEssentials self-help website and the business-focused mobile device security guidance produced \\nby the Australian governments Stay Smart Online website. While these publications are \\nsomewhat similar in nature to the NCCoE practice guides, they lack a strong relationship with a \\ncommon, internationally accepted cybersecurity framework. \\n7 activities conducted to develop this report explore a possible option for providing more specific \\npractical cybersecurity advice for Australian SMEs. 1.1 Background \\nThis report leverages the Mobile Device Security Project performed by the National \\nCybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) in the United States. The NCCoE is a public-\\nprivate partnership that creates practical cybersecurity solutions by using a standards-based \\napproach. NCCoE uses currently available commercial technology to produce easily adaptable \\nsolutions to address cybersecurity challenges facing industry. Example solutions or reference \\narchitectures are documented in a practice guide that contains three parts: Volume AExecutive Summary, a high-level overview of the project, including \\nsummaries of the challenge, solution, and benefits Volume BApproach, Architecture, and Security Characteristics, a deep dive into \\nchallenge and solution, including approach, architecture, and security mapping to \\nrelevant standards Volume CHow-to guide providing detailed instructions on how to implement the \\nsolution, including components, installation, configuration, operation, and maintenance The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Practice Guide for \\nMobile Device Security: Cloud and Hybrid Builds (the Practice Guide), also known as NIST \\nSpecial Publication 1800-4, is among the cybersecurity practice guides produced by the NCCoE. \\nAll NCCoE practice guides leverage the United States NIST-published Framework for \\nImproving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, commonly referred to as the Cybersecurity \\nFramework, or CSF.",
