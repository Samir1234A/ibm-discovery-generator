  "text": "value of network traffic presumed to be observed under shortest path. This is a shortfall, and must be addressed in future research. The first definition of an attack with observers will use the following data. SET CONDITION DESCRIPTION N Set of underneath nodes N0 N0 N Super node set representing external attack origins L L N,N0 L = Leaf nodes A Set of arcs attacks can occur over NM NM N Nodes containing observers of value to the attacker AM AM (N\\\\N0) (N\\\\N0) Set of node pairs (s, t) with valued traffic The physical network contains NM and AM , defining the observers and the pairs of nodes between which observing their traffic is desirable. The assumption will be that traffic for (s, t) AM will travel along the shortest path from s to t, using only nodes that have not been attacked. If that path is incident with a node in NM , the traffic (s, t) will be considered observed. PARAMETER CONDITION DESCRIPTION ca a A Cost to attack via an arc b Budget for attacks 17 VARIABLE CONDITION DESCRIPTION wi i N\\\\N0, wi [0, 1] Indicator of disabling of a node pa a A, pa [0, 1] Indicator of an attack via an arc ui,a i N/baclaN, Attack path indicator for each node a A, ui,a [0.1] m(s,t) (s, t) AM ,m(s,t) [0.1] Indicator traffic is monitored g(s,t),a (s, t) AM , a A, g(s,t),a 0 Shortest path flow x(s,t),i (s, t) AM , i N\\\\N0 Shortest path dual values The assumption will be that attacks may choose to disable any node it attacks, or leave them functioning. Attacks could be modeled with Big M flow constraints, in this case, since any node may be attacked. However, the shortest path calculations would be expected to dominate the order of the size of the problem, this model will stick with the Steiner formulation. A Big M coefficient would be at the head of the binary decision dependencies and could cause pseudo randomness in traditional means of finding solutions. Shortest path calculations pose an issue, since shortest path must be en- forced while the objective functions run counter to the network adhering to the condition. As such, each shortest path will be modeled with both the primal and dual versions for enforcement. Before getting to the model, some discussion is required regarding the pri- mal/dual formulations of shortest path. Using the defined parameters and for some s, t N\\\\N0, and a vector h {1.0.1}\\n|N\\\\N0|, where hs = 1, ht = 1 and hi = 0 otherwise, the primal formulation of the shortest path from s to t is min 1Tg (19) s.t.\\n (j,i)A,j 6N0 g(j,i) \\n (i,j)A,j 6N0 g(i,j) = hi i N\\\\N0 g 0 The variable g can be assumed to be binary. The resulting dual problem is max xt xs (20) xj xi 1 i, j N\\\\N0 : (i, j) A (21) A primary problem in implementing shortest path as a way to model network traffic is that attacked nodes need to be removed form the internal formulation. Moreover, the resulting problem could be infeasible. Both cases must be han- dled. The case that the resulting problem becomes infeasible First, consider the new shortest path formulation when nodes V = {i N\\\\{N0 {s, t}} : wi = 1} are removed. The resulting primal formulation is 18 min 1Tg (22) s.t.\\n (j,i)A,j 6{N0V } g(j,i) \\n (i,j)A,j 6{N0V } g(i,j) = hi i N\\\\{N0 V } g(i,j) 0 (i, j) A : i, j N\\\\{N0 V } To convert model 19 to model 22 using w as a variable, the constraints g(i,j) + wi 1 i, j N\\\\N0 : (i, j) A g(i,j) + wj 1 i, j N\\\\N0 : (i, j) A can be applied and note that on deleted constraints on associated attacked nodes trivially equal 0. The modified dual is max xt xs (23) xj xi 1 i, j N\\\\{N0 V } : (i, j) A To convert model 20 to model 23 using w as a variable, the constraints on attacked nodes need to be removed. The constraints can be modified by adding a Big M reduction xj xi |N\\\\N0|(wi + wj) 1 i, j N\\\\N0 : (i, j) A where it is known the longest shortest path is limited by the nodes in N\\\\N0. These modifications leave the case where the resulting shortest path is in- feasible, either due to s or t being attacked or s and t having a cut set being attacked. One workaround, used here, is to modify h using m(s,t). The premise is that shortest path will only be calculated if m(s,t) = 1, that is the network traffic passes through an observer. If the s, t pair is cut or the shortest path is not incident with an observer, m(s,t) will be forced to 0 and make the primal/dual trivial with 0 solutions. These modifications can be made by setting hs = m(s,t) ht = m(s,t) and then requiring that some observer be incident to the path with (i,j)A:i,jN\\\\N0,iNM or jNM g(i,j) m(s,t) 0 and then requiring primal/dual equality with 1Tg (xt xs) = 0 19 . These shortest path models must be done for each (s, t) AM . The proposed overall model will additionally trim some unnecessary variables out which are always 0 due to optimality conditions. The assumption made on the model that any monitored path is lexicograph- ically longer than an unmonitored path of the same length is not explicitly modeled. Perturbations on the primal/dual of the shortest path sub-models easily achieve this. The proposed model following combines the Steiner Attack formulation with a new functional decision tree objective and the discussed shortest path sub models for each (s, t) AM . 20 min moeopr(w),moeobs(m) (24) s.t. cTp b (25)\\n (n0,j)A:n0N0 uk,(n0,j) wk = 0 k N\\\\N0 (26)\\n (i,k)A uk,(i,k) wk = 0 k N\\\\N0 (27)\\n (j,i)A uk,(j,i) \\n (i,j)A uk,(i,j) = 0 k N\\\\N0,i N : i 6 N0, i 6= k (28) uk,a pa 0 k N\\\\N0,a A (29)\\n (s,j)A,j 6N0 g(s,t),(s,j) m(s,t) = 0 (s, t) AM (30)\\n (i,t)A,i6N0 g(s,t),(i,t) m(s,t) = 0 (s, t) AM (31)\\n (j,i)A,j 6N0 g(s,t),(j,i) \\n (i,j)A,j 6N0 g(s,t),(i,j) = 0 (s, t) AM ,i N\\\\{N0 {s, t}} (32)\\n (i,j)A:i,jN\\\\N0,iNM or jNM g(s,t),(i,j) m(s,t) 0 (s, t) AM (33) g(s,t),(i,j) + wi 1 (s, t) AM ,i, j N\\\\N0 : (i, j) A (34) g(s,t),(i,j) + wj 1 (s, t) AM ,i, j N\\\\N0 : (i, j) A (35) x(s,t),j x(s,t),i |N\\\\N0|(vi + vj) 1 (s, t) AM ,i, j N\\\\N0 : (i, j) A (36) 1Tg(s,t) (x(s,t),t x(s,t),s) = 0 (s, t) AM\\n(37) p {0, 1}|A| (38) u {0, 1}|N\\\\N0||A| (39) v {0, 1}|N\\\\N0| (40) m {0, 1}|AM | (41) g 0 (42) 21 The objective function now has two functional decision trees. Constraints 25,26,27,28,29 are from Steiner Attack. Constraints 30,31,32 are similar path constraints, requiring traffic that is observed have a flow of one from the sender to the receiver. Constraint 33 requires observed traffic be incident with some observer. Constraints 34,35 prohibits network traffic from using a disabled node. Constraints 36,37 form the duals for the shortest paths, enforcing that shortest paths are simple, shortest paths. Constraint 37 has a Big M coefficient to trivialize constraints that should not be in the dual due nodes being disabled. 22 \",",
