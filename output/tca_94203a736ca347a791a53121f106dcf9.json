PRS Case: 18-3770 2 Table of Contents\\nLAN Insights into APM Adoption \\nAlliance to Modernize Healthcare (CAMH) Federally Funded Research and Development Center, which is operated by the MITRE \\nCorporation.\\n2 Category 3B: Fee-for-service-based shared-risk, Procedure based bundled/episode payments, and Population-based payments \\nthat are NOT condition specific. LAN Insights into APM Adoption At its inception in 2015, the Healthcare Payment Learning and Action Network (LAN)1 has adopted the \\ngoal of transitioning 30% of U.S. healthcare payments to alternative payment models (APMs) by 2016 \\nand 50% by 2018. The LAN believes that moving to value-based payment is necessary to improve the \\nquality, efficiency, and overall value of the American healthcare system. In October 2018, the LAN \\nreleased the annual results of its APM Measurement Effort, which demonstrates that almost 34% of \\nhealthcare payments in 2017 were made through alternative payment models that is, shared-savings, \\nshared-risk, bundled payments, or population-based payments. Given the growing interest in alternative \\npayment models with downside risk, such as shared risk, bundled payments, and population-based \\npayments, the LAN refined its measurement survey to capture greater detail of these models. The \\nsurvey data found that 12.5% of all health care spending surveyed was in downside risk models in 2017. \\nThe measurement results also found that 90% of responding payers expect APM activity to increase and \\nnearly half (48%) of payers identified subcategory 3B2 as the APM subcategory to be most impacted. \\nFurthermore, the enhanced survey examines how four different lines of business commercial, \\nMedicaid, Medicare Advantage, and Medicare FFS are making progress toward the LAN goals, and \\nreports findings at the payment or subcategory level within the four categories of the LANs Refreshed \\nAPM Framework. The following insights explore APM progress at the aggregate level and by line of \\nbusiness, as well as lessons learned from three years of measurement. Aggregated Results \\nThe LANs annual APM Measurement Effort has captured payments made in calendar years (CY) 2015, \\n2016, and 2017. To accomplish this, the LAN invited health plans and states from across the nation to \\nreport payments made to providers according to the Refreshed LAN APM Framework. At a high level, the \\ncategories and payment methods within the categories include, but are not limited to: Category 1: Traditional fee-for-service or other legacy payments not linked to quality\\nCategory 2: Foundational payments like care coordination fees or pay-for-performance \\nCategory 3: Shared-savings, shared-risk, bundled payments\\nCategory 4: Population-based payments and integrated finance and delivery systems Figure 1 below depicts the categories and subcategories described in the Refreshed LAN APM \\nFramework http://hcp-lan.org/workproducts/apm-refresh-whitepaper-final.pdf\\nhttp://hcp-lan.org/workproducts/apm-refresh-whitepaper-final.pdf Approved for Public Release.

The LAN does not expect or intend that all \\npayments will ever be in Category 4. \\n4 The term Managed FFS Medicaid states refers to states that pay providers directly, rather than operate through Medicaid \\nManaged Care Organizations. Such states typically invest in payment models geared toward improving care quality and delivery \\nfor Medicaid beneficiaries. Figure 1: LAN APM Refreshed Framework3 The LAN collaborated with Americas Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) and Blue Cross Blue Shield \\nAssociation (BCBSA) to gather representative data on the types of payments health plans with \\ncommercial, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage business made to healthcare providers in 2017. The LAN \\nalso collaborated with the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to collect this data from \\nMedicare FFS. In addition, the Association for Community Affiliated Plans (ACAP),the Alliance of \\nCommunity Health Plans (ACHP), and the National Association of Medicaid Directors encouraged their \\nmember plans or managed FFS Medicaid states4 to participate in the LAN effort.

R., Hood, E., and Barnett, J.C., Current Population Reports, P60-264, Health Insurance Coverage in the United Interpreting the Aggregated Results In comparing the results of this years survey to the prior two years (Figure 2), adoption of Category 3 \\nand 4 APMs increased 5 percentage points (or a 17% increase), bringing total APM spending to \\napproximately $385.5 billion nationally. While payment models in Categories 3 and 4 are the LANs \\nprimary focus, it is also important to note the changes in Categories 1 and 2. Since the first year of APM \\nmeasurement by the LAN, payments made through Category 1 (payments with no link to quality) have \\ndecreased by 34%. Category 2 payments also decreased between last years and this years \\nmeasurement, from 28% to 25%. While it is not possible from the LANs data collection process to track \\nwhere these payments go year-to-year, payments in Categories 3 and 4 collectively have increased at a \\nsteady pace from 23% in the first year of measurement to 34% in this years effort. It is unlikely that \\npayments in Category 1 with no link to quality moved directly to Categories 3 or 4; rather, Category 1 \\npayments likely moved to Category 2, and payments previously made in Category 2 are now being \\ncaptured in Categories 3 and 4. Figure 2: LAN APM Measurement Effort Results: \\nComparison between 2015, 2016, and 2017 Payments: 62% 15% 23% 43% 28% 29% 41% 25% 34% CATEGORY 1 CATEGORY 2 CATEGORY 3&4 2015 2016 2017 Figure 2 compares data from CY 2015, CY 2016, and CY 2017. In 2015, data was \\ncollected from 70 plans and 2 managed FFS Medicaid states, which represented 198.9 million lives or 67% of the U.S. covered population. In 2016, the data was collected \\nfrom 78 plans, 3 managed FFS Medicaid states, and Medicare FFS. This represented 245.4 million lives or 84% of the U.S covered population. In 2017, the data was \\ncollected from 61 plans, 3 states, and Medicare FFS, representing 226.3 million lives or 77% of the U.S. covered population.5 Approved for Public Release.

Health Affairs. August 14, 2018. \\nhttps://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog2 68/full/ Changes in Category 1: \\nThe decrease in payments in Category 1 appears to be driven by Medicare FFS and by health plans \\nconsistently reporting that they continue to negotiate contracts that compensate providers using some \\ntype of quality measurement. Tying some payment to quality is a move away from paying purely on fee-\\nfor-service without any link to quality. Additionally, based on the responses to the informational \\nquestions, 90% of health plans believe that APM adoption will increase in the next 24 months, signaling a \\ncommitment to move away from Category 1. When Medicare FFS dollars are removed from Category 1, \\nwe see that Category 1 payments rise to 57%. Changes in Category 2 4: \\nDespite over 50% of Medicare FFS payments in Category 2, Category 2 payments decreased modestly \\nfrom the last measurement effort to 25%. If we remove Medicare FFSs dollars from Category 2, \\npayments in this category drop sharply to 12%, roughly in half. This is not to say that the other market \\nsegments are using pay-for-performance less as a contracting strategy; rather, two dynamics are likely in \\nplay. First, pay-for-performance is generally the first step for providers before they move to contracts \\nthat involve more complex gainsharing, like shared-savings, captured in 3A. Subcategory 3A6 has a \\nsignificant proportion of APM activity (19.4%, the majority of which is the shared-savings payment \\nmodel), so it is possible that the training wheels of historic pay-for-performance contracts are being \\nreplaced with shared-savings contracts. Second, more providers are taking on shared-savings \\narrangements as part of the accountable care organization (ACO) movement, and pay-for-performance \\ndollars might be added to these contracts. There were 480 ACOs participating in Medicare Shared \\nSavings Program (MSSP) in 2017, with 9 million assigned beneficiaries. Of these ACOs, 82%, or 460, were \\nin Track 1 (non-risk based).7 Meanwhile, there were approximately 700 commercial ACO contracts in \\n2017, and slightly more than 90 ACO contracts in the Medicaid sector.8 Anecdotally, it is known that \\nsome shared-savings arrangements have a pay-for-performance bonus layered on top. It is difficult to determine whether Category 3 or Category 4 is driving the overall increase in these \\ncategories because previous years results reported aggregated total dollars in Categories 3 and 4 \\ncombined; however, this year, we examined Category 3 and Category 4 separately. Based on 2017 data, \\naggregated results indicate that subcategory 3A has the most APM dollars of these two categories, at \\n21.1%, while 3B has the second-most APM dollars flowing through it at 8.7%. Subcategories 4A, 4B, and \\n4C combined had 3.8%. Given the preponderance of Category 3 payments in 2017, it",
