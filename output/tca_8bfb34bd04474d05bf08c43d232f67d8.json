  "text": "single violation was observed \\nwithin an IM Trail Aircraft and IM Lead Aircraft pairing, despite the introduction of far more off-\\nnominal deviations than would be expected in actual operations. This instance involved a \\ncontroller appearing to attempt to manually assign a speed to keep an IM Trail Aircraft behind \\nthe CSL and allowing the IM PA operation to continue. It was not a result of the controller failing \\nto notice a developing situation. Separation was also examined between other aircraft combinations (e.g. between the trail \\naircraft of a leading pair and the lead aircraft of a following pair). Twelve total instances of \\nseparation violations were observed between aircraft pairs not performing IM PA. It was unclear \\nif this was due to the presence of IM PA in the operational environment or was related to \\ncontrollers in the simulation not having current separation tools such as ATPA available to them. \\nAlthough these violations occurred in the context of simulation events that were designed to \\nstress test the concept and ground tools, their presence still suggests that tools and procedures ii\\n need to be fully integrated to ensure that separation between aircraft pairs not performing IM \\nPA can be maintained while IM PA operations are in progress. In addition, IM PA setup spacing \\nrequirements should ensure that between-pair separation can be sufficiently maintained during \\ncompression on final. Controller participants on average reported: low and acceptable workload; acceptable tasks in \\neach of the monitoring positions; acceptable levels of traffic awareness for all types of aircraft; \\ncomfort in allowing the IM Trail Aircraft to manage their own speeds; and confidence they could \\nassess whether the separation between the IM Trail Aircraft and Lead Aircraft would be \\nmaintained. They also agreed IM PA is operationally desirable and compatible with terminal \\napproach operations, though real-world facility and airspace integration may be challenging. \\nController participants appeared to be comfortable monitoring IM PA when safety limits that \\nchanged over the course of an approach were both active at the same time. Facilities with dependent parallel runway operations typically employ separate L/R Final \\nApproach controllers due to the workload involved in vectoring aircraft to final and other \\nintensive tasks. Implementing separate L/R Monitor controllers, as would be required by current \\n7110.65X rules, may not be practical or feasible at SFO since that would also require separate \\nLocal controllers and frequencies, one for each arrival runway. It was therefore of interest to \\nexamine whether a single, combined Monitor controller can effectively provide separation for \\nCSPR finals involving IM PA operations. Results suggest under nominal conditions, a single, \\nCombined Monitor controller is likely to be able to effectively and acceptably provide \\nseparation within and between IM PA pairs. However, further study is recommended to \\nexamine whether separate monitors may ultimately be required for safety to manage extreme \\noff-nominal lateral deviation situations. With respect to the IM PA-related display features and tools introduced for the simulation, the \\ngraphic depictions of the CSL and WSL were found useful for the overall monitoring task and \\ncontrollers recommended they always be displayed. As the WSL only became active late in the \\napproach, controllers found the WSL-P tool helpful in indicating whether an aircraft would \\neventually require a WSL and the IM Trail Aircrafts current proximity to it. Half of the TRACON \\ncontroller participants felt the WSL-P should always be on and half felt it should be user \\ntoggleable. Controllers also suggested the WSL-P should be displayed earlier than what was \\nimplemented in the HITL. Controllers on average agreed the IM PA Predictive and Caution Alerts \\nwere both were useful, though they agreed more strongly for the Caution Alert. They also \\nsuggested the alert timing could be reduced from what was implemented for ATPA. The data \\nblock line 3 features, including the current numeric distance to each safety limit, along with a \\nW indicating a future WSL, were not found to be useful. The lateral monitoring task appeared feasible and acceptable to controllers, given the \\nappropriate tools and training. Current STARS display features such as PTLs and separation \\nbats (cones) appeared to provide an immediate and salient visual cue when aircraft ground \\ntracks began to diverge from the approach course. Controllers appeared to find the Lateral \\nBoundaries useful, especially with the FMA display. Though the FMA display was found to \\nsignificantly aid in the Lateral Boundary assessment, responses did not appear to suggest it \\nshould be a minimum requirement. Controllers also found the Exceedance Warning useful and iii\\n provided sufficient time and situational awareness to choose and execute appropriate \\ncorrective action when needed. It could, however, possibly be made more salient by changing \\nthe color of the entire data block of the deviating aircraft, plus changing the color of only a \\nboundary line segment near to the deviation instead of changing the color of the entire line. On \\naverage controllers also suggested a predictive-type Exceedance Warning may be helpful, but \\nnot essential. Most controllers reported a Final Monitor controller is the most appropriate position to monitor \\nIM PA operations, though this may ultimately depend on the facility. They also expressed a \\nstrong desire to manually provide speeds to the IM Trail Aircraft when they observed a spacing \\nsituation start to develop. The ability for controllers to manually provide speeds to assist the IM \\nPA operation may ultimately depend on which position is responsible for providing separation. \\nA dedicated Monitor controller or a Final Approach controller could be responsible for IM PA, \\ndepending on the facility configuration. This controller would likely have enough spare capacity \\nto manually issues speeds to keep the IM Trail aircraft within the safety limits. However, with a \\nMonitor controller / Local controller override configuration such as that tested in the \\nsimulation, significant concerns were raised with the number of communications that could be \\nrequired to manage deteriorating IM PA operations. Even if the IM PA and the FIM Equipment \\nproves to be highly reliable in keeping the IM Trail Aircraft within the safety limits, the Monitor \\ncontrollers will still need frequency time to manage between-pair spacing. Manual PA speed control may not be possible, however, if a Final Approach controller position \\nis responsible for providing IM PA separation. Depending on the task loading and \\ncommunications bandwidth, a Final controller may simply not have enough spare capacity to \\nissue speeds to resolve a deteriorating IM PA operation. There may only be time to break out an \\nIM Trail Aircraft once a Caution Alert is triggered. In this case, the usefulness of a Predictive \\nAlert may be reduced and so only a Caution Alert would be required. This suggests the need for \\nat least some of the features may be dependent upon the specifics of how a facility may choose \\nto integrate IM PA into their operation and which controller position would be responsible for \\nproviding separation. Though controllers overall suggested they would be able and willing to \\nprovide speeds to keep the aircraft within the safety limits, the practical considerations with \\nrespect to managing the required communications may make this highly challenging to \\nimplement. The second major HITL objective was to evaluate the IM PA initiation task, especially with \\nrespect to Partial IM Clearance procedures. Controller participants on average agreed Final \\ncontrollers can acceptably initiate the IM PA operation and given the appropriate training and \\ntools, can acceptably ensure separation during IM PA operations before transferring aircraft to \\nthe Local controller. They also agreed they were comfortable with the IM Trail Aircraft \\nmanaging their speeds to achieve the spacing goal while in their area. The information \\ncontained in the IM Spacing List appeared useful for the IM PA initiation task. Concerns were raised regarding the phraseology, available CSL and WSL information at the time \\nof initiation, and the available time and airspace to perform the initiation task as simulated. On \\naverage, controllers agreed it is operationally acceptable for the Final controller to provide the \\nIM PA spacing goal and the IM PA spacing goal communication was acceptable. This suggests iv\\n the Partial IM Clearance procedures were acceptable to the Final controllers, though further \\nresearch is recommended to examine Feeder controller acceptability to provide the first part of \\nthe clearance. It was recommended, however, the IM Clearance phraseology and procedures \\ncould be improved over what was used. Controllers also suggested adding a CSL Preview line \\non the display to indicate where the IM Trail Aircraft was relative to the CSL before controllers \\nneeded to provide the IM Clearance. This would avoid IM PA initiations with aircraft not in the \\ncorrect positions. Finally, although controllers had sufficient time and airspace to initiate IM PA \\nbefore transferring the aircraft to the Local controller, they suggested more airspace would \\nhave been desirable to adjust the initial spacing if needed and reduce the criticality of the \\ntiming. Overall results suggest given the appropriate tools and training, the IM PA longitudinal and \\nlateral separation monitoring and initiation tasks should be acceptable to controllers. In a \\nrelated IM PA flight deck features evaluation performed in 2018, pilots also found IM",
