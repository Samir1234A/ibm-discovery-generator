Employees values should be consistent with the \\norganizations observed and stated values, and their work-related needs should be \\nsatisfied through the job. Job-person fit must exist in terms of needs and values as \\nwell as skills. Employees should understand how their jobs contribute to the agency \\nmission and goals. The following sections summarize the results of MITREs interviews and literature \\nresearch, organized according to relevant components of the Burke-Litwin model. 2.1.1 External Environment 2.1.1.1 Visibility and Accountability Certain aspects of the External Environment have major impacts \\non agencies motivation to reduce improper payments. First, \\nofficials from agencies and accountability organizations indicated that both external and \\ninternal visibility and accountability serve as motivators. External visibility is especially 8 motivating, via mechanisms such as the public release of improper payments information \\nin the annual Agency Financial Reports (AFR) and oversight by Congress, OMB, audit \\norganizations, and other stakeholders such as the media. The public has access to a great \\ndeal of information in the AFRs and on paymentaccuracy.gov, and as one agency official \\nnoted, millions of Americans are touched by their benefits programs, so they want to \\nmaximize public confidence in the programs. Another agency pointed out that external \\nvisibility increases reputational risk thereby providing motivation, while on the other hand, \\nan accountability organization pointed out that there are really no consequences (for \\nexample, reductions in funding) to agencies for not complying with IPERA and OMB \\nguidance, which decreases their motivation.11 Internally, some agency and accountability \\nofficials stated that peer pressure and formal internal reporting can be motivators; for \\nexample, internal improper payments boards that require periodic reporting help officials \\nkeep focused on the issue. Many programs are totally or partially funded by the federal government, administered by \\nstates, and carried out by grantees and contractors. Agency officials recognized that just as \\nwith their agencies, External Environment visibility and accountability need to motivate \\nstates, grantees, and others to reduce improper payments. One agency, for example, uses a \\nname and shame technique in a key programpublishing the five states with the highest \\nimproper payment rates in order to motivate them to reduce their rates. The agency also \\ntakes actions such as increasing the level of monitoring and sending letters to the \\ngovernors of these states requiring remediation plans. 2.1.1.2 Legislation Another key aspect of the External Environment is legislation.12 Various mandates play a \\nrole in how agencies are motivated to reduce their improper payments. In particular, \\nagencies motivation can be impacted by legislatively driven program design issues. For \\nexample, some programs must rely heavily on timely beneficiary self-reporting of life \\nchanges. This happens in the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, where benefits \\nare paid on the first of the month for the upcoming month, but beneficiaries do not always \\nreport income changes that could affect their eligibility to the Social Security \\nAdministration (SSA). While working to reduce improper payments, including taking steps \\nto enhance data matching to address this issue, agency officials nonetheless recognize the \\nissue that this mandate creates. At the same time, legislative restrictions can constrain federal agencies ability to address \\nPayment Integrity problems, de-motivating them in their efforts. The most notable statute \\nin this regard is the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act (CMA) of 1988 (P.L. \\n100-53), which restricts the computerized matching of data sets within an agency or \\nbetween agencies. Both what CMA requires (such as computer matching agreements that \\nare limited to terms of 18 months) and what it does not say (for example, there is no \\n11 For more information on reputational risk and its relationship to Payment Integrity, see section 3.2.4. \\n12 For a more complete discussion of this issue, see MITREs study report, GOVERNMENT-WIDE PAYMENT INTEGRITY: \\nNEW APPROACHES AND SOLUTIONS NEEDED (MTR160040, February 2016) https://paymentaccuracy.gov/ 9 blanket authority to match agency data with external data sources) create problems. Some \\nagency officials suggested that even limited changes like lengthening the term of the \\ncomputer matching agreements from 18 months to 5 years, for example, would be very \\nhelpful. Federal statutes also play a role in addressing states Payment Integrity problems. In \\nparticular, agency officials indicated that some statutes restrict how states can spend funds \\non Payment Integrity activities, and that statutes are increasingly limiting the percentage of \\nfederal funding received that the states can use for oversight that would help improve \\nPayment Integrity. Some programs would need legislative authorization to allow the states \\nto use some of the funds they recover for additional Payment Integrity activities. Finally, \\nsome agency officials said they would like to compel the states to use their administrative \\nfunds to do more Payment Integrity-related data analytics and matching but would need \\nlegislation to do this. One agency cited a positive example where they had done this within \\nexisting legislative parameters, mandating that states in one program use the National \\nDirectory of New Hires in order to detect individuals still receiving benefits after \\nreemployment. In another example, the Medicare Access and CHIP13 Reauthorization Act of \\n2015 (P.L. 114-10) requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to \\nspecify incentives that would encourage states to participate in a Medicaid data matching \\nand mining program. 2.1.1.3 Resources The lack of resources devoted to Payment Integrity challenges agencies motivation. Both \\nagency and accountability officials acknowledged that the governments difficult fiscal \\nenvironment makes the likelihood of obtaining resources specifically to fight improper \\npayments very low. While there are some notable returns on investment for such dollars\\nsuch as SSI redeterminations ($8 returned for every $1 invested), Continuing Disability \\nReviews (9:1), and work reviews (11:1)even when such investments are authorized and \\nmade in one year they are subject to budget cuts the next. Some officials believed that agencies, in general, cannot keep any of the funds recovered \\nfrom activities like those above, or from recovery audits, for use in additional Payment \\nIntegrity or program activities. Instead, they believed that some of the funds could be kept \\nfor the purpose of helping to cover the administrative costs incurred in conducting the \\nactivities, while the balance of the funds must be turned over to the U.S. Treasury. \\nHowever, recovered funds are, in fact, available for other purposes. OMB Circular A-123, \\nAppendix C, Part I.D.14, provides implementing guidance for IPERA on the proper \\ndisposition of recaptured funds. The Circular provides that overpayments from expired \\ndiscretionary fund accounts14 that are not used to reimburse agency expenses or pay \\nRecovery Audit Contractors are to be used for a financial management improvement \\nprogram, for the original purpose of the funds, or for Inspector General activities, or they \\n13 Childrens Health Insurance Program \\n14 The guidance contains different requirements for overpayments from unexpired discretionary fund accounts, \\nmandatory fund accounts, and closed accounts. 10 should be returned to the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts or to trust or special fund \\naccounts. In particular, up to 25 percent of these recaptured funds may be used for an \\nagencys financial management improvement program to ensure that actions are taken to \\nimprove internal controls to address problems that directly contribute to improper \\npayments. IPERA characterizes this as the first priority of this program. Finally, applied literature and research stressed that agencies should be required to meet \\npolicy goals and evaluated periodically to measure progress. However, the research \\nindicates that cutting their budgets as a way to motivate them to better mitigate improper \\npayments only exacerbates the problem. Some agency officials also believed that incentives for \\nstates to invest funds in Payment Integrity activities are \\ninadequate. These officials offered the following thoughts. When the states are the flow-through vehicle for \\nfederal funds on the way to the ultimate recipients, \\nhaving the states dedicate some of their own \\nresources to reducing improper payments is a cost \\nto them without an apparent benefit. Consequently, \\nsome states have suggested changing financial \\nincentive structures (for example, in the \\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \\n[SNAP]) to promote conducting fraud investigations. In some jointly funded programs, the states have \\nhistorically had little incentive to recover improper \\npayments because for each dollar recovered they \\nmay only keep their share of the funding (which is \\nalways less than half). States need resources to use for Payment Integrity activities, but federal funds \\nappropriated for this purpose have been decreasing. 2.1.2 Mission and Strategy Clear, publicly stated Payment Integrity goals also serve as \\nmotivators. Agency officials said that publishing goals externally \\naddressing key aspects of improper payments is helpful, coupled \\nwith the reduction targets required by IPERA for programs with \\nreported improper payments. Some agencies publish such goals in their strategic plans or \\nAFRs. A number of officials believed that a government-wide CAP Goal would quite likely \\nbe of help in motivating agencies. Internal goals can also be used as part of an overall \\nstrategy to reduce improper payments, especially if this is combined with employee \\ninvolvement such as soliciting their input to identifying root causes and corrective actions. In one program, agency \\nofficials indicated that in \\nrecent years, federal funding \\nhas been provided to \\nindividual",
