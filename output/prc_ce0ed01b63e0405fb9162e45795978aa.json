  "text": "action. However, once the Exceedance Warning was \\ndisplayed for the Lead, some controllers in this scenario may have then also decided to \\nthen intervene with the slowly-deviating Trail instead of waiting for it to cross the Lateral \\nBoundary. It is also notable that these cases occurred more often in the Separate Monitor \\nconfiguration (12/14) versus Combined (2/14). This is likely due to the difference in the \\ntiming of the communications between the configurations, especially with the scenarios \\ninvolving traffic file O, which comprised ten of these 14 cases. The timing of these O \\nscenarios was such that that the shallow-deviating Trail crossed its Lateral Boundary and \\ntriggered its Exceedance Warning shortly after the Lead Aircraft (of a different pair) \\ntriggered its Exceedance Warning. In the Combined Monitor configuration, the controller \\ntypically contacted the sharply-deviating Lead Aircraft first to turn it back, then \\ncontacted its Trail Aircraft to instruct its breakout. This was given higher priority than the \\nshallow-deviating Trail, and so it then crossed its Lateral Boundary and triggered the \\nExceedance Alert before the controller could contact it. In the Separate Monitor cv\\n configuration, however, the 28R controller was not required to contact the deviating \\nLead Aircraft. Therefore, there was more time for the 28R controller to break out the \\nTrail from the deviating lead and then break out the shallow-deviating Trail before it \\nactually crossed its Lateral Boundary. As noted in Section 4.5.5.3, the O scenario was deliberately designed as an extreme case. In \\nreal world operations, a near-simultaneous lateral deviation of multiple aircraft on CSPR \\nis expected to occur rarely, if at all. An investigation of over 1.8 million approach paths \\ndid not detect any (Eckstein, Massimini, McNeill, & Niles, 2012), nor was there a record \\nof any in an examination of 7790 go-arounds that were logged over multiple years by \\nNCT (Stassen, Domino, Hefley, & Weitz, 2019). Still, this was included in the simulation to \\nstress the display features and probe for a potential failure point. The findings here, \\nthough not conclusive, may suggest controller behavioral differences with respect to \\nintervening with aircraft deviating laterally may only be apparent in the most extreme \\nsituations. When this occurs, however, the findings are consistent with a general \\nexpectation that controllers may be able to take action more quickly when only having \\nresponsibility for one arrival. Simulation Evaluation6.7\\nAt the end of Day 3 (QT8) controllers were asked about their overall experience in the \\nsimulation and its effectiveness in evaluating IM PA. This section summarizes their responses. Controllers were first asked if the training I received was adequate for the IM Clearance \\nCompletion and IM PA monitoring tasks. Given their specific experience in the areas being \\nsimulated, NCT responses are shown separately. Non-NCT and Tower responses are thus also \\nshown as separate categories. Response Means and Standard Deviations are summarized in \\nTable 5-70. Scale responses are shown in Figure 5-79. Table 5-70. Controller Responses to Adequacy of Simulation Training by Task Participant Experience Non-NCT NCT Tower IM Clearance Completion\\nSample Size (n) 6 4 2 Mean (M) 96.0 88.0 96.5 Standard Deviation (SD) 7.5 5.4  IM PA Monitoring Sample Size (n) 6 4 2 Mean (M) 97.2 90.5 96.0 Standard Deviation (SD) 4.0 2.5  cvi\\n Figure 5-79. The training I received was adequate. All controllers responded that the training they received was adequate for both tasks. --------------------------------- Controller participants were also asked whether the overall activity was effective as a context \\nfor evaluating the IM Clearance Completion task and IM PA monitoring task. Given their \\nspecific experience in the areas being simulated, NCT responses are shown separately. Non-NCT \\nand Tower responses are thus also shown as separate categories. Response Means and \\nStandard Deviations are summarized in Table 5-71. Scale responses are shown in Figure 5-80. Table 5-71. Controller Responses to Simulation Effectiveness by Task Participant Experience Non-NCT NCT Tower IM Clearance Completion\\nSample Size (n) 6 4 2 Mean (M) 95.3 61.5 96.5 Standard Deviation (SD) 7.2 29.8  IM PA Monitoring Sample Size (n) 6 4 2 Mean (M) 96.2 90.5 96.5 Standard Deviation (SD) 5.3 7.8  cvii\\n Figure 5-80. The overall activity was effective as a context for evaluating the IM Clearance completion \\ntask and the IM PA monitoring task. All controllers agreed the overall activity was effective as a context for evaluating the IM PA \\nmonitoring task. The majority (83%) agreed the simulation was effective for the IM Clearance \\ncompletion task. One NCT controller neither agreed nor disagreed and commented that Issuing \\nthe clearance did not seem realistic. Another NCT controller disagreed and commented: IM \\nPA initiation did not take into account how much workload the final controller is doing prior to \\nissuing the instructions. --------------------------------- Finally, at the end of Day 3, controllers were asked if there was anything about the simulation \\nthat artificially affected using it as a context for evaluating IM PA operations. Four (4) \\ncontrollers answered Yes, seven (7) answered No, and one (1) did not provide a response. \\nSelected comments included: One Yes comment: (NCT) Lack of practical scenarios in which vectoring and other \\nevents are taking place.\\nOne Yes comment: (TRACON) At first, too much speed control required to maintain \\nseparation between pairs that took focus off IM PA functionality. It did bring to light how \\neasy/noticeable the alerts were while focused on other tasks. Note: this was a Week 1 controller response. Scenarios were modified between o\\nWeek 1 and Weeks 2-3 to reduce the need for this speed control. One Yes comment: (TRACON) No instant override makes some blunders and overtakes \\nlook even worse because of the delay in implementing controllers instructions.\\nOne Yes comment: (TRACON) I didn't feel like the aircraft speeds throughout the final \\napproach were necessarily realistic. Hypothesis Evaluations6.8\\nAs discussed in Section 3.3, six research questions and seven hypotheses were defined prior to cviii\\n HITL data collection. This section consolidates and summarizes the findings relevant for each \\nhypothesis. As needed, statistical tests were performed on the subjective questionnaire data to \\ninform the hypothesis evaluation. H1(RQ1): Given an appropriate tool set, controllers will find it acceptable and 6.8.1\\nfeasible to monitor IM PA operations with respect to both minimum and \\nmaximum separation limits. This hypothesis was measured via responses to three questions related to monitoring comfort, \\nseparation assessment, and task acceptability. The first part of the hypothesis, acceptability, \\nwas measured by controller responses to the following Day 1-2 post-run (QT1) question: Given \\nthe IM PA-related tools provided in this scenario, I was comfortable monitoring IM PA \\noperations when both a CSL and WSL were active at the same time. As described in Section \\n5.2.2, nearly all Week 2-3 TRACON controllers agreed they were comfortable monitoring IM PA \\noperations with both limits at the same time for both the monitor configurations and IM PA \\nTools configurations. Only one controller neither agreed nor disagreed, and this was for the \\nSeparate 28R Monitor with IM PA Tools Off configuration. To determine if this resulted in a statistically significant difference between controller responses \\nfor the On versus Off IM PA Tool configurations for the Separate 28R Monitor controller, a \\npaired-sample T-Test analysis was run on the Week 2-3 TRACON controller agreement ratings \\nfor this question. The descriptive statistics (n, M, and SD) are shown in Table 5-4. The probability \\nof finding an effect when there was none, alpha (), was set to 0.05. The results of a two-tailed \\nT-Test analysis failed to find statistical significance (p = 0.22). This suggests no significant \\ndifference in strength of controller agreement between the two IM PA Tool configurations with \\nrespect to monitoring IM PA operations when both a CSL and WSL were active at the same time. Acceptability was also measured by controller responses to the following Day 2 end (QT3) \\nquestion: The tasks required of each simulation position were acceptable. As described in \\nSection 5.2.5.2, nearly all TRACON controllers agreed for the positions that required IM Trail \\nAircraft Monitoring (Combined and Separate 28R). One controller neither agreed nor disagreed \\n(for the Combined Monitor configuration). --------------------------------- The second part of the hypothesis, feasibility, was measured by controller responses to the \\nfollowing Day 2 end (QT3) question: Overall, I was confident that I could assess whether the \\nseparation between the IM Trail Aircraft and their Lead Aircraft would be maintained. As \\ndescribed in Section 5.2.5, the majority (80%) of TRACON controllers agreed. This self-\\nassessment was supported by the objective separation analysis in Section 5.2.5.2, which found \\nonly a single instance of a within-pair IM PA separation violation. Conclusion: This hypothesis is supported by the simulation results. Overall, controllers found it \\nacceptable and feasible to monitor IM PA operations with respect to both minimum and \\nmaximum separation limits. This did not appear to be affected by monitor configuration or IM \\nPA Tools configuration. cix\\n H2(RQ2): Given an appropriate tool set, controllers will find it acceptable and 6.8.2\\nfeasible to provide PA separation with respect to separation values that change \\nover the course of an approach. Though not asked this question directly, controllers in every scenario experienced a CSL that \\nchanged in",
