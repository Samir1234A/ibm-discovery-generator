  "text": "from punishment by management. And management must trust employees to provide reports, and not simply ignore safety hazards or foretell events. This type of organizational culture that actively protects those who report hazards (except in cases constituting criminal behavior or willful disregard for safety) defines just culture [13]. Punitive culture has roots in the Industrial Revolution, and we understand it well. The potential for punishment raises awareness in employees, and motivates care before acting. On the other hand, an employees fear of being blamed or punished for errant actions can degrade trust, and reduce his or her willingness to report on the associated hazardous situations. Trust and information-sharing provide the basis of a positive safety culture. When an organization places high priority on proactive safety, and values trust and information-sharing, the workforce perceives and responds to that priority eliciting a safety climate [14]. With an adequate level of trust and commitment, employees feel incentivized and empowered to report risks and share knowledge of risk factors without fear of reprisals (unless their actions were unlawful or reckless) [15]. Reported events become instructive, transforming the organizations knowledge and ability to gauge risk.

Industry introduced safety technology with trepidation, mainly when tragedy insisted on quick adoption. As the decades progressed, the government began to show progressive signs of investing in research programs to dissect safety hazards. Early examples in aviation during the 1940s were simply an experimental testing of safety concepts, such as stall warning devices and approach lighting systems. In 1956, when a well-publicized midair collision occurred in clear and uncongested skies over the Grand Canyon (an accident that punctuated a string of sixty-five midair collisions in just over five years), it was clear that more aviation safety research was critically needed. Around that same time, railroads were changing rapidly. Mergers of large and small railroads were occurring that blended safety methods from each proponent together, with mixed results. Like the aviation field, a string of 20 high-profile rail accidents in the 1950s punctuated the need for further safety improvements. The 1960s marked a significant shift in the safety mindset in aviation and rail. At the close of the 1950s, in response to a string of aviation accidents and public concern, the Department of Transportation Act (DOT) of 1966 set up the FAA and Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). FAA made the commitment to intensify air traffic safety methods, safety policy, and forward- thinking safety research. With the advancement of safety data collection technology such as secondary surveillance radar systems and Cockpit Voice Recorders to accompany the widespread use of aircraft Flight Data Recorders, FAA identified the need to partner with trusted independent advisory organizations to provide expert analytics. In 1961 FAA employed the help of Flight Safety Foundation to investigate the mid-air collision epidemic and compile statistical data, perform analyses, and provide recommendations. The study was based on pilot reporting and identities were protected from FAA to encourage pilot participation. This approach led to generating information regarding more than 2,500 incidents over a one-year study period. The final report recommended that FAA continues the collection of anonymized reports; however, the program did not extend beyond the study period [16]. At the end of the decade, FAA began a four-year study on the causes of near midair collisions. This study employed a non-punitive, cooperative reporting approach. To encourage participation, FAA granted limited immunity from disciplinary action to any person involved in a voluntarily reported near midair collision during the study. However, when the pilot study period terminated in 1972, so did the reporting immunity policy. During this period, the FRA also made strong commitments to rail safety. The NTSB would later show that during this period about a third of collisions and derailments were attributed to incorrect operating practices and employee negligence [17]. By assuming the powers of the Interstate Commerce Commissions Bureau of Railroad Safety, the FRA sought to shift the focus of rail safety regulation to people familiar with the industry [18]. Public pressure over rail accidents also prompted Congressional investigations, which concluded that the vast majority of accidents were caused by factors that were not covered under existing statutes. The result of this shift in focus was the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 which gave the FRA rulemaking authority to \\\"promote safety in all areas of railroad operations and to reduce railroad related accidents, and to reduce deaths and injuries to persons and damage to property caused by accidents involving any carrier of hazardous materials.\\\" [19] Annual safety records 3-2 became a requirement for certification of railroads from the States to the Secretary of Transportation. The government listed highway-rail grade crossing incidents as the top safety task to research and address. These remain a top safety priority today. Class I railroads formed under the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 [20] required railroads to adopt safety procedures and cultures from merging railroads. In the early 1970s, public confidence in the aviation system started to unravel, fueled mostly by the increasing number of hijackings and high-profile accidents. By the end of 1974 (aviations worst year for fatalities), a biting congressional report and television documentary illustrated the agencys sluggishness on safety issues and further raised public concern [21] [22]. Prompted by these criticisms, in 1975, FAA established the Aviation Safety Reporting Program (ASRP) to enable pilots or controllers to identify any potentially unsafe conditions and not simply to report near midair collisions. To again encourage reporting, this broader safety program employed the same arrangement used during the midair collision program: granting immunity from disciplinary action for those reporting promptly. FAA retained the right to take appropriate punitive action in cases of gross negligence or willful disregard for safety. Due to limited protections granted under the aviation reporting program, the aviation community still feared disciplinary consequences and employees submitted very few reports [16]. The next year, FAA transferred control of the program to a neutral third partythe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)to handle the data, protect confidentiality, and process reports. The FAA intended to overcome fears that genuine anonymity and immunity were not being provided. The government named the program the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS). This program is the aviation equivalent to rails Confidential Close Call Reporting System (C3RS) managed by NASA [23]. In terms of technology and its role during this timeframe, the growing introduction of computers in aviation, safety-related sensing equipment, and data-recording technology rapidly expanded capabilities for weather sensing, communications, on-board collision avoidance, and flight tracking. Air Traffic Control (ATC) radar systems saw increased abilities to detect, record, and share flight data between radar facilities, and the amount of data collected by Flight Data Recorders expanded. In rail, the FRA enacted the Rail Safety Improvement Act (RSIA) of 1988 [24]. This act mandated event recorders on the railroads, requiring rail operators to record locomotive control inputs and other safety-related data. Building on tensions from the previous decade, aviation in the 1980s experienced growing mistrust amidst the airlines, the government regulators, and the traveling public. Labor strikes by airline pilots and air traffic controllers, significant airline merger activity, and widespread industry drug and alcohol abuse continued to stoke the discord between workforce, management, regulator, and public [25]. In other circumstances FAA delegated technical assessments directly to the manufacturers, relying on localized trust-relationships rather than directly assessing technology [26]. This behavior served to undermine the overall ability of the FAA to effectively regulate the industry. In 1988, a Congressional report recognized a need for industry collaboration and recommended key safety management and system operating improvements considering the new order set by the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978: Airlines themselves keep vital safety information, and FAA could benefit from working more closely with airline data, although ensuring the confidentiality of the air carrier data 3-3 is crucial. FAA could encourage improved air carrier presorting of sensitive safety data, such as incidents, by guaranteeing that no penalties will result from reported information and by making non-reporting a violation. Additionally, access to airline computer systems, such as maintenance management systems, could enhance FAAs monitoring capabilities. One major airline already provides FAA",
