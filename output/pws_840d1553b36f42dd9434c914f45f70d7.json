  "text": "T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t Enabling Big Changes in \\nMedicare Payment 2017 brings merit-based incentives for clinicians In October 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) released rules overhauling how the agency pays physicians and other \\nclinicians. Called the Quality Payment Program, the new approach rewards the delivery of high-quality care through two interrelated pathways: Advanced Alternative Payment Models (APMs) and the Merit- based Incentive Payment System (MIPS). MITRE provided CMS with strategic guidance for the design of MIPS, which rewards quality and efficiency improvement efforts and the use of electronic health record technology. We also contributed to the development of the Advanced APMs, which provide added incentives to deliver high-quality and cost-effective care. Recognizing that true delivery system reform requires working with a range of healthcare stakeholders, CMS asked MITRE to convene the Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network, which includes health plans, providers, patients, employers, consumers, states, federal agencies, and other partners. These stakeholders are now working together to promote the adoption of alternative payment models to achieve better care and smarter spending. n 27T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n Using Data to \\nDefeat Drug Fraud Approximately 78 Americans die every day from opioid overdoses. More than half of these deaths stem from the misuse \\nof prescription opioid pain relievers. Federal and state government agencies have launched a variety of efforts to address the opioid abuse epidemic. One of these, the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP), gives individual states the ability to collect data about controlled substance transactions. MITRE researchers saw the PDMP as a means to identify prescription fraud schemes involving patients, prescribers, and pharmacies. A MITRE team worked with the state of Indiana to apply advanced analytics to more than 12 million transactions registered with the Indiana Board of Pharmacy. They used that information to create two Web-based tools. One assists prescribers in determining a patients risk of drug-seeking behavior to help catch doctor shoppers. The other scores providers for potential fraud to help predict where fraud is most likely to occur. Preventing more fraud and abuse will save more lives. n As much as \\n$72 billion a year goes toward drug \\naddiction \\ntreatment 28 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t Approximately 78 \\nAmericans die every day from opioid \\noverdoses 29T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n 30 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t Applying Safety Science \\nto Child Welfare Every year, as many as 2,000 U.S. children die as the result of abuse or neglect. MITRE is partnering with the Department of \\nHealth and Human Services (HHS) to prevent these tragic deaths through data sharing and analysis. MITRE has already successfully partnered with government and industry to use an information sharing and analysis approach to improve aviation safety and to prevent avoidable patient safety events in medical facilities. To achieve these outcomes, we collect data from a variety of sources and analyze it to identify safety issues. We are conducting an analysis for HHS to assess the potential benefits of this approach in the field of child welfare. While our long-term vision is to develop national partnerships for the sharing of child welfare and related data, we are also working at the local level. For example, we are collaborating with the County of San Diegos Health and Human Services Agency to develop a system to collect and analyze child welfare, medical, and substance abuse data. Our effort there is generating important insights and will help to refine our efforts and approach at the national level. n Every day, 4 to 8 \\nchildren in the U.S. die from abuse or neglect MITRE is \\npartnering with \\nHHS to prevent tragedies through \\ndata sharing and analysis 31T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n Cyber Lab Helps Secure \\nthe Smart Home In 2016 MITRE worked with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to create a state-of-the-art lab at the National \\nCybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) to address the threats to security and privacy posed by the Internet of Things (IoT). The term IoT refers to devices equipped with software, sensors, and effectors networked with one another via the Internet. Although these networked devices can improve efficiency in the home, they also carry security risks. The new Consumer IoT Initiative (CITI) lab functions as a simulated smart home to enable researchers to explore these challenges. Leveraging MITREs trusted adviser role, researchers can then develop strategies for securing consumers security and privacy, as well as countermeasures to address the adverse impact a large group of compromised IoT devices can have on the Internet itself. CITI is now fully operational and welcomes research topics from industry, NIST, and other sponsors. Results from the labs experiments will inform and enhance NCCoEs efforts to help U.S. industry apply secure technologies that enable consumers to enjoy the many benefits of a smart home without sacrificing security and privacy. n IoT: MITRE helps balance benefit and risk 32 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t 33T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n More than 4.6 million \\nveterans live \\nin rural areas 34 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t Assisting Veterans \\nin Rural Areas MITRE is helping demonstrate the art of the possible for managing care The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) asked MITRE to come up with a system that would improve the provision \\nof care to the 30 percent of the nations veterans who live in rural areasa setting with unique healthcare challenges. In response, MITRE helped create and pilot a system focused on rural veterans receiving home healthcare. Today, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) contracts with home health agencies for these services. Coordinating that care is a manual process involving paper forms and phone calls. This often results in missed communications, inconsistencies in the patient record, and delays in the provision of care. To address these issues, MITRE automated the process in a secure Web-based environment to enable VA and home health providers to electronically share plans of care, record patient observations, reconcile medication discrepancies, and facilitate the communication of additional orders. This pilot is demonstrating the art of the possible for managing care in the community, reducing costs, and improving patient safety, and it positions the VHA as a national leader in moving toward patient-centered plans of care. n 35T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n Patching Vulnerabilities in \\nOur Digital Infrastructure Over 30,000 NIST practice guides have been downloaded to date The recent denial-of-service attacks on the Internet routing company Dyn shut down major swaths of the Internet, exposing \\nvulnerabilities in our digital infrastructure. What if the targets had been the power grid or the financial sector? To safeguard the nation from such scenarios, MITRE works with NIST to accelerate the adoption of advanced security technologies. MITRE is helping the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) to engage new collaborators to drive awareness and promote early adoption of new technologies and standards. In 2016, we assisted NCCoE in publishing four practice guides on such industry-identified challenges as Securing Electronic Health Records on Mobile Devices and Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities. Our efforts also helped NCCoE increase its key stakeholder relationships by 68 percent and garnered some 30,000 practice guide downloads. In addition, MITRE developed new ways to rapidly share NCCoEs pragmatic solutions. For example, our video of the Attribute-Based Access Control practice guide has been viewed more than 2,000 times on the NIST YouTube channel. n 36 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t In October 2016, a distributed denial- of-service attack shut down dozens of popular websites 37T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n Communications \\nTesting North of the Arctic Circle 38 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t Melting icecaps are creating access for trade routes, cruise ships, and natural resource exploration, all of which \\nimply missions for the Department of Defense.
