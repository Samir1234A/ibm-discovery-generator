  "text": "based on the runway they were working. In the \\nHITL, the 28L Final controller position was not staffed by a participant; the HITL automation \\nmanaged the arrivals and frequency changes for arriving aircraft. Still, tasking for the 28L Final \\ncontroller position needed to be identified. The 28L Final controller was responsible for the following tasks: Accept 28L handoffs from Feeder Controller.\\nProvide 28L traffic with approach clearances.\\nIssue 28L traffic frequency change to Local controller at approximately 15 to 20 NM. The 28R Final controller had initiation and monitoring responsibilities related to the IM PA \\noperation and had access to the following tools: IM Spacing List, Data Block Distances, and the \\nCSL when PA is initiated. The 28R Final controller was responsible for the following tasks: Accept 28R handoffs from Feeder Controller.\\nProvide 28R traffic with approach clearances.\\nView IM Spacing List and provide 28R traffic with Assigned Spacing Goal at the xxvii\\n appropriate time.\\nIndicate proposed IM Clearance acceptance, rejection, or termination in the IM Spacing \\nList.\\nEnsure the IM Trail Aircraft remains behind the CSL from the time the Assigned Spacing \\nGoal is issued to when the aircraft has transferred to the Local controller frequency.\\nIssue frequency change to 28R traffic to Local controller at approximately 15 to 20 NM. Local Controller Position Tasking5.4.2\\nStaffed by confederates in the HITL, Local (Tower) Controllers were necessary to provide \\nlanding, takeoff, and other clearances as necessary for SFO arrival and departure traffic. They \\nprovided a steady stream of communications that the controller participants, serving as Monitor \\ncontrollers, could hear. Though the confederate Local controllers issued landing clearances, \\nthey were not responsible for aircraft separation along the final approaches. IM PA monitoring in both combined and separate Local controller configurations was examined. \\nThe Combined Monitor configuration employed a single Local controller who issued landing \\nclearances for both 28L and 28R runways. The Separate Monitor configuration involved \\nseparate Local controllers, one for each arrival runway, and had split responsibilities. The \\ntasking for the confederate Local controllers for each configuration is described below. Combined Local controller configuration: Provide landing clearances to arriving 28L/28R traffic.\\nProvide takeoff clearances to aircraft on 1L/1R.\\nProvide other clearances, such as runway crossings, as needed. Separate Local controller configuration: 28L Local controller\\nProvide landing clearances to arriving 28L traffic.o 28R Local controller\\nProvide landing clearances to arriving 28R traffic.o\\nProvide takeoff clearances for aircraft on 1L/1R.o\\nProvide other clearances, such as the 28L runway crossing, as needed.o IM PA Monitoring and Monitor Controller Tasking5.4.3\\nAlthough the Final Approach controller ensured that the IM PA operations began with the IM \\nTrail Aircraft behind the CSL, the Monitor controller(s), assisted by IM PA display features and \\nalert automation had separation responsibility for the majority of the approach. The general \\nmonitoring task and procedures for both longitudinal (along track) and lateral deviations is \\ndescribed below, followed by specific Monitor controller responsibilities and procedures as \\nconveyed to the participants. Longitudinal Monitoring Procedures5.4.3.1\\nAs described in Section 4.2.1, controllers were informed that an IM Trail Aircraft was safely xxviii\\n 11 The controller procedures for managing aircraft deviations across any of the Lateral Boundaries were notional constructs \\ndeveloped specifically for the HITL simulation. Actual procedures accounting for the range of possible lateral deviation \\ngeometries require further development. separated while it remained within the safety limit(s). Controllers were alerted if an aircraft \\nbegan to encroach on either of the safety limits. Depending on the alert, the procedures to \\nresolve the situation and ensure separation are as described in Section 4.2.7. These consisted \\nof: Predictive (yellow) CSL or WSL Alert: Monitor the situation, be prepared to take action. If \\ndesired, can optionally confirm IM PA equipment status with IM PA aircraft.\\nCaution (orange) CSL or WSL alert: Break out the trail aircraft. Lateral Monitoring Procedures5.4.3.2\\nAs described in Section 4.2.8, Lateral Boundaries were implemented to help controllers \\ndetermine whether observed flight path deviations were within design bounds for normal \\nvariability, or whether they constituted a situation beyond what the CSL and WSL were designed \\nto accommodate. Research with respect to lateral deviations during an IM PA operation is still in its early stages. \\nThus, in the design of the lateral deviation monitoring task and response procedures, the HITL \\nmade assumptions based on work done to date. An analysis of over 1.8 million recorded \\napproach paths suggests that flight path deviations on approach are rare; 82 were found, for a \\nrate of 4.47x10-5 (Eckstein, Massimini, McNeill, & Niles, 2012). Of those, 42 involved a deviation \\nangle of 10 degrees or more. The remainder involved a deviation angle of less than 10 degrees. \\nThe impact on spacing, separation and wake turbulence avoidance of a potential protracted \\nshallow angle deviation during a PA operation is not fully understood. However, the safety limits \\nare designed using assumptions about the nature of TSE with respect to lateral course tracking \\n(Williams & Wood, 2017). Flight path deviations in excess of the assumed TSE invalidate the \\nprotections that the CSL and WSL provide. It may therefore become necessary to break out one \\nor both IM PA Aircraft in response to some flight path deviations, not just to terminate IM PA, \\nbut also to manage collision and wake turbulence risk within the IM PA pair. This may especially \\nbe the case for an inboard deviation by the IM Lead Aircraft. The HITL simulation assumed that outboard deviations by either aircraft beyond what the CSL \\nand WSL have been designed to accommodate result in the end of the IM PA operation and the \\nneed to establish an alternate form of separation. However, the safest course of action in these \\ncases is probably for the non-deviating aircraft of the pair to continue on the approach. An \\ninboard deviating IM Trail Aircraft, in either direction, should not be in a position to affect the \\nIM Lead Aircraft. Based on this, controllers were provided three procedures11 two with respect to IM Lead Aircraft \\nlateral deviations, and one with respect to an IM Trail Aircraft lateral deviation. They were not \\nrequired to take action until the Lateral Boundary Exceedance Warning was triggered. IM Lead Inboard Deviation: If the IM Lead Aircraft deviates to the right and crosses its 1.\\ninboard lateral boundary, advise the IM Trail Aircraft that the IM PA operation is over, \\nissue a go-around procedure to the IM Trail Aircraft, and manage the IM Lead Aircraft \\nper standard operating procedures. xxix\\n IM Lead Outboard Deviation: If the IM Lead Aircraft deviates to the left and crosses its 2.\\noutboard lateral boundary, do not break out the IM Trail Aircraft. Terminate the IM PA \\noperation, establish an alternate form of separation, and manage the resolution per \\nstandard operating procedures. IM Trail Deviation: If the IM Trail Aircraft deviates laterally and crosses either boundary, 3.\\ninboard or outboard, the IM PA operation ends. The controller leaves the IM Lead \\nAircraft on the approach, advises the IM Trail Aircraft that the procedure has ended, and \\nmanages the deviating aircraft per standard operating procedures. Controllers were given the following guidance for breakouts, but were told they had full \\ndiscretion to resolve developing separation problems as they saw fit: For the left aircraft, the controller was to climb them to an altitude of their discretion, \\nput them on a 260 heading, and transfer them to Departure (SUTRO). \\nFor the aircraft on the right, the controller was to climb them to an altitude of their \\ndiscretion, put them on a 280 heading, and transfer them to Departure (SUTRO). Monitor Controller Position Tasking5.4.3.3\\nAs described earlier, this HITL examined IM PA monitoring with respect to both Combined and \\nSeparate Monitor configurations. The specific tasking for each configuration is outlined below. Combined Monitor configuration: Monitor the Local controllers frequency.\\nIssue speed instructions to aircraft as needed to provide required separation. For an IM PA pair, any speed instructions should be given to the IM Lead Aircraft. o\\nSpeed instructions given to the IM Trail Aircraft terminate the IM PA operation.\\nBreak out any aircraft as needed to ensure separation.o\\nIf breaking out a Lead Aircraft, terminate IM PA operation with the trail aircraft.o Use the display features to monitor the IM PA operation and provide separation.\\nIssue control instructions as needed to keep the IM Trail Aircraft from violating the o\\nWSL and CSL. Terminate IM PA operation in the event of a lateral deviation by either aircraft.\\nIn this configuration, the Monitor controller had the following tools available: CSL, WSL, WSL-P, \\ndata block additions, Alerting, and Lateral Boundaries. Separate Monitor configuration: 28L Monitor Controller: Monitor the 28L Local controllers frequency. Provide separation \\nbetween (not within) IM PA pairs by providing speed assignments to 28L aircraft, \\nincluding the IM Lead Aircraft, if needed.\\n28R Monitor Controller: Monitor the 28R Local controllers frequency. Provide separation \\nwithin IM PA pairs by taking action if a safety limit is about to be exceeded. \\nBoth controllers had the following tasks: xxx\\n Monitor aircraft positions with respect to the lateral boundaries.o\\nIntervene as needed to ensure separation is maintained.o\\nApply (Wake RECAT) single runway separation to non-IM aircraft. o Both controllers had the following tools available: CSL, WSL, WSL-P, data block additions, \\nAlerting, and Lateral Boundaries.
