  "text": "IM Trail Aircraft (Trail Active). \\nFor the IM Lead Aircraft, L(A) indicated an active IM Lead Aircraft (Lead Active) as shown in \\nFigure 4-9. Figure 4-8. IM Trail Aircraft IM Status Figure 4-9. IM Lead Aircraft IM Status ix\\n The data block also was able to display CSL and WSL distance, which provided controllers with a \\nnumeric indication of the distance from the IM Trail Aircraft to each safety limit. In cases where \\na WSL was not yet active, the data block indicated whether it would eventually apply to the \\naircraft pair by displaying a W with no corresponding numeric value. Figure 4-10 provides an annotated representation highlighting the CSL and WSL elements in the \\ndata block. Figure 4-11 shows the data block elements as displayed on the controllers screen \\nduring the simulation. In summary, the data block line 3 information elements included the \\nfollowing four items: In the first field, the IM Trail Aircraft Status was displayed.1. In the second field, the distance to the CSL (in NM) was displayed, coded with a C.2. In the third field, when a WSL applies to that pairing, the distance to the WSL (in NM) is 3.\\ndisplayed, coded with a W. Before the WSL applies in these cases, only the W was \\ndisplayed as a pre-active WSL indication. If no WSL applies to that pairing, only the IM Trail Aircraft Status and CSL distance value 4.\\nare displayed. Figure 4-10. Annotated Display of CSL and WSL Data Block Elements Figure 4-11. Data Block Elements, as Displayed in the HITL As described in Section 4.5.4, the Data Block Distances to the CSL and WSL were investigated as \\nan independent variable. They were either turned on or off for the Monitor controllers, \\ndepending on the scenario. x\\n Line Representing the CSL5.2.4\\nA line was introduced on the display to provide a graphical indication of the minimum limit of \\nthe PA separation standard which, for the HITL, was set to the CSL value. Controllers ensured \\nseparation by keeping the IM Trail Aircraft behind this line. The CSL was represented by a cyan \\nline on the IM Trail Aircrafts path as depicted in Figure 4-12, and moved with the IM Lead \\nAircrafts progression along its path. The CSL line represented the values shown in Figure 4-6. Figure 4-12. Cyan Line Representing the CSL Line Representing the WSL5.2.5\\nA second line was introduced on the display to provide a graphical indication of the maximum \\nlimit of the PA separation standard which, for the HITL, was set to the WSL value. Controllers \\nensured separation and wake protection by keeping the IM Trail Aircraft forward of this line. \\nThe WSL was a cyan line on the IM Trail Aircrafts path as shown in Figure 4-13, and moved with \\nthe IM Lead Aircrafts progression along its path. When a WSL was applicable, it became active \\nwhen the lead was 2 NM from the runway as shown in Figure 4-6. Figure 4-13. Cyan Lines Representing the CSL and WSL xi\\n WSL Preview Line 5.2.6\\nWhen a WSL applied to an aircraft pair, it was only active for the last 2 NM of the final. \\nTherefore, to avoid surprising controllers with a sudden display of the WSL, it was hypothesized \\nthat it would be useful to provide controllers with an advance indication that a WSL would \\neventually apply and its relative location at that time to the IM Trail Aircraft. Therefore, a WSL-P \\nwas implemented to provide an advance indication of where the WSL will appear when it \\nbecomes active. It was represented by a grey line at the location where the WSL would \\neventually appear, as shown in Figure 4-14. Figure 4-14. Grey WSL-P Although a WSL shape could theoretically change over the course of an IM PA operation, only \\none preview limit was displayed during the simulation to represent the initial wake separation \\nlimit that would come into effect. The behavior of the WSL-P remained continuous as it \\ntransitioned to reflect the compression of the aircraft pair. When the WSL became a \\nrequirement, the display then changed to the active state symbology (i.e., the cyan WSL line \\ndescribed in Section 4.2.5). During its development, at least two potential issues were identified with the WSL-P that \\nneeded additional investigation. First, it does not indicate when a WSL would become active; it \\nonly indicates that at some point a WSL will become active. Second, at greater groundspeed \\ndifferentials between the IM Trail Aircraft and IM Lead Aircraft, the WSL-P can first appear in \\nfront of the IM Trail Aircrafts current position. Then, as the IM Trail Aircraft caught up, it \\ncrosses over the WSL-P. It is possible that this may prove confusing and undesirable to \\ncontrollers and was therefore included in the scenarios. In the HITL, the WSL-P was first displayed when the IM Trail Aircraft was approximately seven \\nNM from the runway threshold. Therefore, the WSL-P was not expected to be useful for the \\nFinal controller. As described in Section 4.5.4, the usefulness and acceptability of the WSL-P was \\ninvestigated as an independent variable and it could thus be turned on or off for the Monitor \\ncontrollers, depending on the scenario. Longitudinal Alerting5.2.7\\nAs noted in Section 2.3.2.2, ATPA Phase 1 alert timing served as a foundation for the \\ndevelopment of the IM PA alerting. The objectives of the IM PA alerts were to indicate to the \\ncontroller when: 1) an IM Trail Aircraft was potentially at risk of encroaching on either of the xii\\n 8 The terminology for these alerts is consistent with those used for ATPA. These are, however, departures from industry \\nstandard definitions for Caution and Warning, in which a Caution is only an advisory and a Warning requires an action. safety limits, and 2) when the controller must take an action (e.g., aircraft breakout) to maintain \\nseparation. Two levels of longitudinal alerting were implemented in the simulation: A Predictive Alert was displayed in yellow when crossing a limit boundary was predicted 1.\\nto occur within <X> seconds. Here, the controller may still have had time to intervene by \\ncontacting the aircraft and confirming that the flight crew was still following the IM \\nSpeeds. This was a situation awareness advisory and controller action was not required. A Caution Alert was displayed in orange when a limit boundary would be crossed within 2.\\n<Y> seconds. When receiving this alert, the controller was required8 to break out the IM \\nAircraft and establish an alternate form of separation. The two alerts shared the same logic; only the timing values were different. The default \\nPredictive / Caution alert timings were the same as those implemented for ATPA: 45 seconds \\nand 24 seconds, respectively. Alternate Timings investigated in the HITL included: 35 seconds / \\n20 seconds and 25 seconds / 15 seconds. This was intended to examine whether lower alert \\ntimings than those chosen for ATPA remain acceptable to controllers for the IM PA monitoring \\ntask. Reduced timings may ultimately be used to mitigate against nuisance alerts (which would \\noccur more frequently with greater timings). Prior to the HITL, training emphasized that the predictive advisories do not necessarily require \\nan action and that controllers should not break out aircraft prematurely to avoid one. The alerts \\napply to both the CSL and WSL, and it was possible to receive a WSL alert before the WSL was \\nactive as described in Figure 4-15. Figure 4-15. Predictive Alerting Logic xiii\\n Figure 4-16 provides an example of the default alert timing distances. In the figure, the CSL and \\nWSL are illustrated for operations inside 2 NM from the threshold. The CSL alert distances are \\nbased on a hypothetical 30 knots (kt) faster trail aircraft. The WSL alert distances are based on a \\nhypothetical 10 kt faster Lead Aircraft. The Predictive Alert Timing is 45 seconds and the Caution \\nAlert Timing is 24 seconds. Figure 4-16. Default Alert Timing Distance Example The alerts were active with respect to both the CSL and WSL. When the alerts were triggered, \\nthe CSL or WSL display, and the CSL/WSL Data Block Distance value (if displayed) changed color \\naccording to the level of alert and which limit was being encroached upon. Figure 4-17 depicts the IM PA Predictive Alert relative to the CSL. The CSL display and Data Block \\nDistance value are color-coded yellow to indicate the Predictive Alert state. Figure 4-17. IM PA Predictive Alert Relative to CSL Figure 4-18 depicts the IM PA Caution Alert relative to the CSL. The CSL display and Data Block \\nDistance value are color-coded orange to indicate the Caution Alert state. xiv\\n Figure 4-18. IM PA Caution Alert Relative to CSL Some scenarios involved the use of a 4:1 FMA display for IM PA monitoring in a simulated \\nFUSION mode which provides a one-second update rate. Figure 4-19 shows a Predictive Alert \\ndepiction on this display, relative to the CSL. The figure also depicts the Lateral Boundaries, \\nwhich are described in Section 4.2.8. Note also that the controller is using the (optional) STARS \\nbats to track aircraft ground tracks relative to the",
