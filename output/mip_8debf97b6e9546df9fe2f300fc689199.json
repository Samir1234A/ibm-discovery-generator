  "text": "    \"text\": \" Interns Develop Software Tool for Air Operations (a Student Voices article) When college students Ryan Vinh and Akhil Jacobs came to MITRE for a summer internship, they got a \\nchallenging assignmenthelp develop software for improving air tasking orders (ATO) for a military \\nsponsor. ATOs organize air operations in a military environment to maximize efficiency and effectiveness \\nwhile minimizing the dangers of having multiple types of air operations occurring in the same airspace. \\nTo accomplish this work, Vinh and Jacobs worked with MITREs Derek Lax. This project started shortly before Vinh and Jacobs began their summer internships. MITRE staff working \\nfor the sponsor suggested developing a software tool to automate the compilation of filtered ATO \\nreports while also reducing the chances of inadvertently releasing sensitive information. The current \\nmethod of modifying these daily reports was manually intensive and time consuming. Lax, Vinh, and Jacobs took on the challenge of developing a prototype for automating these processes. \\nLax led the overall software development effort. Vinh, a junior at Princeton majoring in computer \\nscience, and Jacobs, a junior at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute majoring in computer systems \\nengineering and computer science, wrote much of the code. Time Spent Becomes Time Saved Working together, the three-person team developed the prototype for an automated tool that reads the \\ndaily reports and parses themand does it in a fraction of the time, eliminating human error. What \\ntook roughly 30 minutesassuming everything went well, which it didnt alwayswas reduced to \\nbetween one and two minutes using the new tool, Lax says. Once they had a prototype done, Vinh and Jacobs helped present their findings to the sponsor. The team \\nstayed in constant contact with the military end-user throughout the development period. This steady \\nstream of user feedback afforded them valuable insight to adjust an existing feature or add a new \\nfeature using an Agile development methodology. In addition, software bugs were addressed during \\ndevelopment. The entire effort took approximately three months. Another aspect of this project was to use this tool development as an exemplar of the Continuous \\nIntegration/Continuous Delivery toolchain used in MITREs Networked Experimentation, Research, and \\nVirtualization Environment (NERVE). The team introduced the prototype into the environment and \\nsuccessfully demonstrated how code changes could be easily introduced, tested and made ready for end-\\nuser inspection. Making a Difference The hard work of Lax, Vinh, and Jacobs paid off. With additional help from the sponsor, the tool received \\n\\\"Authority to Operate with conditions\\\" and as of mid-June 2018 is being used in day-to-day operations. Both Vinh and Jacobs are ecstatic about the hands-on experience they received during their internships \\nat MITRE. It really felt like I was making a difference in the real world, Jacobs says. Adds Vinh: I never \\nthought I would actually work on a project with so much impact and visibility. I never expected to help \\ncreate something this summer that could be deployed to actual warfighters, let alone something that we \\nwould present to high-ranking officers! They were both extremely bright and quick to learn, Lax says of the two. They quickly adapted to the https://www.mitre.org/publications/project-stories/it-takes-nerve-to-bring-isolated-labs-people-together new tools. It was a pleasure to work with them. by Tom Nutile If these or any of our many intern opportunities interest you, check out our current Job Openings or read \\nmore about our Student Programs.
