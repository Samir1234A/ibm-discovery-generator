His other research interests include mathematical modeling of natural processes observed in remotely sensed data and the application and evaluation of radiative transfer models as applied to the spectral remote sensing of the earth's surface. David W. Messinger received a Bachelors degree in Physics from Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York, USA and a Ph.D. in Physics from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Tory, New York, USA. He has worked as an Analyst for XonTech Inc., on the National Missile Defense Program for Northrop Grumman and was an Intelligence Community Postdoctoral Research Fellow. He is currently a Professor, the Xerox Chair in Imaging Science, and Director of the Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science at the Rochester Institute of Technology where he was previously the Director of the Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Laboratory. He has published over 100 scholarly articles. Dr. Messinger is an Associate Editor of the journal Optical Engineering, a Senior Member of SPIE, serves as the co-Chair of the SPIE conference Algorithms and Technology for Multispectral, Hyperspectral, and Ultraspectral Imaging, on the technical committee of the Department of Energy Conference on Data Analysis (CODA) and is a member of the USGIF Academic Advisory Board. His personal research focuses on projects related to remotely sensed spectral image analysis using physics-based approaches and advanced mathematical techniques with particular emphasis on the use of data driven techniques from the graph theory and manifold learning literatures. https://purr.purdue.edu/publications/1947/1\\nhttp://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php?title=Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes\\nhttp://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php?title=Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes INTRODUCTION\\n HSI Graph Construction Techniques\\n -Threshold Graphs (aka -NN Graphs)\\n k Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) Graphs\\n Density Weighted k-NN (DW k-NN) Graphs\\n Adaptive Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Graphs\\n Initialize\\n =1, = Find nearest neighbors\\n , calculate the Identify reverse nearest neighbor counts\\n , count the number of times i occurs in \\n Build graph Edge Reweighting Methods\\n Spatial/Spectral Methods New Methods for HSI Graph Construction\\n Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) Graphs\\n Compute the pairwise (dis)similarity matrix A primary distance (similarity) measure is used to define initial edges.\\n Construct a mutual k-NN graph Mutuality is imposed to avoid edges crossing regions of differing density (cf. \\\\)\\n Redefine edge weights with the SNN (secondary) metric The number of neighbors shared by the two nodes becomes the new edge weight, replacing the (dis)similarity score from the primary metric.\\n Mutual Proximity Graphs\\n Graph Construction Performance\\n Metrics\\n Data\\n Results Conclusions and Path Forward \",",
