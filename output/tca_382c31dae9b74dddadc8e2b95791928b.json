Cane Charles Schmidt \\nJohn Tufarolo Richard B.

Modeling an IoT \\necosystem is a challenge due to fuzzy system boundaries as the same device may be employed in \\nnumerous different contexts. This fuzzy boundary introduces risk in the overall IoT ecosystem. This paper \\nexplores the definition and meaning of an IoT ecosystem and the complexity inherent within this system \\nthat could have entirely unique characteristics from the convergence of Information Technology (IT) and \\nOperational Technology (OT) components. It then presents an IoT ecosystems theoretical model using \\nhypergraphs and System Entity Structure (SES) theory to propose an IoT-Inclusive-Systems model and an \\nassociated risk evaluation framework. This theoretical model can provide a basis towards modeling IoT \\necosystem as a whole to understand the new normal, a device-centric world view in an IoT-Inclusive-\\nSystem. Keywords: Internet of Things, hypergraphs, system entity structure, complexity, risk management 1 INTRODUCTION The Internet of Things (IoT) is a relatively new and rapidly growing phenomenon. There is considerable \\nand growing concern the rapid deployment of new, connected IoT capabilities will change the risk profile \\nwithin and across many existing technology-driven and technology-enhanced environments. IoT, including \\nits IT and OT components, introduces the possibility of greater physical consequences to vulnerabilities \\nwithin an IoT system. The differences in the traditional risk perspectives of the IT and OT communities \\ncould constrain a comprehensive evaluation of IoT risk when an approach that integrates these perspectives \\nwould produce better results. Because of this rapidly changing environment, there is a need for a model or \\nframework to be used to explore the larger question of whether systemic risks are increased given specific \\nIoT deployments. While there is theoretical and practical modeling work being pursued from a technology \\nperspective, there are no systematic models representing IoT systems along with their environment that \\ncould contribute to a comprehensive risk assessment leading to more complete risk mitigation \\napproaches.

Case Number 18-1212 / DHS reference number 17-J-00100-01 A theoretical model describing the IoT ecosystem is needed to provide methods to describe variations in \\nIoT implementations, their relationship(s) to the environment, and associated risk implications. The purpose of this research is to develop an IoT theoretical model, and describe how such a model could \\nbe used to perform risk assessments in IoT-centric systems. This paper reflects the foundational research \\nbehind establishing this theoretical IoT model and related environment considerations, and is meant \\nprimarily to provide the community (both academic and government) with a foundation which can be built \\nupon to analyze the risk implications of these systems as they become pervasive. IoT modeling is a relatively new concept. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) \\ndeveloped an IoT model conceptualizing five elements (Voas 2016): sensors, aggregators, communication \\nchannel, external utility and decision triggers, to define the utility of devices constituting an IoT system. \\nOther models (Huang and Li 2010) have also tended to focus on a small number of IoT aspects (e.g., cause-\\neffect chaining, focus on connectivity and network topology, etc.) By contrast, the work presented here is an attempt to provide a unified model capable of capturing a broad \\narray of factors impacting IoT systems. These include, but are not limited to, aspects of the devices \\nthemselves, connectivity, connected services, policies, users, physical structures, and many more. This \\npaper explores methods to allow all of these IoT system facets to be captured in a unified model in such a \\nway as to support rigorous analysis methods. While the work presented here is limited to an initial IoT \\necosystem theoretical model with the associated analytics yet to be developed, the authors believe the \\npresented methods provide a promising path by which IoT systems can be understood with sufficient \\ncontext and within their broader environment to support a more comprehensive framework for \\nunderstanding IoT system risks. This paper describes the initial research results to develop a theoretical IoT model. Section 2 samples \\nvarious IoT definitions and presents a device-centric world view. Section 3 presents an overview on \\nhypergraphs, followed by SES theory in Section 4 that describes the pruning process as applicable to an \\nSES model resulting in a Pruned Entity Structure (PES). Section 5 discusses the inherent complexity in \\nIoT-Inclusive-System. Section 6 presents the IoT theoretical model. Section 7 discusses the integrated risk \\nevaluation framework followed by conclusions and future work in Section 8. 2 IOT DEFINITION AND DEVICE-CENTRIC WORLD VIEW The IoT is a relatively recent and evolving phenomenon, sharing a concurrently evolving definition. When \\nused as an acronym in itself, IoT signifies the entire IoT ecosystem. However, the usage of this acronym \\nchanges with every definition. Most IoT definitions arise from the fundamental perspective anything \\nconnected to the Internet becomes a part of an IoT (while neglecting to actually define IoT) (Cisco n.d.). \\nMost definitions acknowledge two semantic elements: the Thing and the Internet. A Thing is defined \\nas a physical device which is supplemented with a computing capability (on-board or remote), such that it \\nbecomes smart, and has both software and hardware interfaces allowing it to connect to the Internet \\n(Mckinsey n.d., CASAGRAS n.d., SIG 2013). Some IoT definitions include business processes, services, \\napplications and infrastructure to support the various things (Haller n.d., CERP-IoT n.d.), while other \\nresearch perspectives include virtual entities, virtual personalities, and all the miscellany of commerce and \\nculture (Berge 1973), including real people (NIC n.d., Sundmaeker, Guillemin and Woelffle 2010, U. F. \\nGroup 2011, Lee, et al. 2011, Domingue, Fensel and Traverso 2008). A particularly compelling IoT definition is provided by UK Future Strategy (U. F. Group 2011): An evolving convergent Internet of things and services available anywhere, anytime as part of an all-\\npervasive omnipresent socioeconomic fabric, made up of converged services, shared data and an Mittal, Cane, Schmidt, Tufarolo and Harris advanced wireless and fixed infrastructure linking people and machines to provide advanced services \\nto business and citizens. Consequently, every IoT system has a purpose: i.e., it serves a community/a group of users/people. \\nFurthermore, any device that gets connected to the Internet without a purpose introduces unnecessary risk. \\nWe define an IoT system as: A complex system consisting of a collection of interconnected smart devices that may span a single \\nuser, a community, a region, a nation or across nations; provides services within an emerging or an \\nexisting system; is distributed across the Internet; and incorporates inherent risk. Together, all the devices deployed to serve a purpose/use-case, with all the underlying infrastructure, \\nconstitute an IoT ecosystem, largely called just an IoT. To fully model an IoT essentially requires modeling \\nthe network and the things, as well as the various contexts in which these two are used. Figure 1 displays a device-\\ncentric view of this IoT \\ndefinition. The IoT-device \\nparticipates in multiple \\ncontexts, across multiple \\nsectors/application-domains. \\nEach ring represents an activity \\nscope (e.g. local, near \\nneighborhood, regional, state, \\nnational and global reach). \\nEach ring has a logical \\nboundary representing the data \\nexchange between different \\nregions through the access \\npoints. As you move out \\ntowards the edges, the scope, \\nscale and possible effect of IoT \\nimplementation increases. Figure 1: Device Centric View of an IoT system Figure 1 presents two use-cases as applicable to two different sectors (for example, electricity and water \\nsectors A and B respectively). It comprises of two use-cases/scenarios depicted as Walk 1 and Walk 2. \\nWalk 1 is a user-oriented regional scenario using resources only in Sector A and operates up to a regional \\nscale. Walk 2 utilizes the network and resources belonging to both Sector A and B and operates on a larger, \\nglobal scale. 3 HYPERGRAPHS To understand the modeling approach, a fundamental understanding of mathematical Graph theory and SES \\ntheory are essential. In simple terms, a graph or network is a collection of nodes and edges representing a \\nproblem space. Nodes represent elements of interest, for example, people, places, activities or systems. \\nEdges reflect the relationships between those nodes. A hypergraph is a graph in which an edge connects \\nmore than two vertices (Berge 1973, Zhou, Huang and Schoelkopf 2006, Bretto 2013, Gallo, Longo and \\nPallottino 1993) and is used to represent many-to-many relationships in a mathematical way. An edge in a \\nhypergraph is called a hyperedge and connects more",
