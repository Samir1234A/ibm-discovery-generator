The key provisions of the \\ndocument are the Essential Eight [22]. Because this report has included the Essential Eight in the \\nmapping of the Practice Guide, the inclusion of Cyber Security for Contractors publication \\nwould be repetitive. Further, the publication recommends that contractors review the guidelines \\npublished by the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC). While the ACSCs guidelines are \\nnot specifically related to mobile devices, the reader concerned with mobile device security \\nshould review Cloud Computing Security for Tenants, which lists essential mitigations for data \\ncompromise [23]. As discussed earlier in this report, mobile devices often leverage cloud \\nservices during business operations. \\n15 4.2.3 Essential Eight ASDs Essential Eight as documented in the Essential Eight Explained build on ASDs previous \\nTop 4 Mitigation Strategies for Targeted Cyber Intrusions with the goal of being a cybersecurity \\nbaseline for organizations [22]. The research undertaken for this project found the Essential \\nEight to be widely used in Australia, even beyond government organizations, and that they also \\nhave some applicability to mobile devices. Therefore, we use the Essential Eight as a basis for \\nmapping to the guidelines found in the Practice Guide. 4.2.4 ISO 27001/27002 The International Organization of Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical \\nCommission (IEC) 27000 series of standards is applicable to any entity implementing a mobile \\ndevice security solution. The Practice Guide includes ISO/IEC 27002, which provides best-\\npractice recommendations on implementing security in its security characteristics mapping. ISO \\n27002 is included in the currently published version of the Practice Guide; therefore, it is not \\naddressed separately in this document. Those seeking information on how ISO 27002 relates to a \\nmobile device security implementation should review the Practice Guide. 4.2.5 NIST Cybersecurity Framework Published in February 2014 by NIST, the Cybersecurity Framework is a guide for entities \\nseeking to employ a flexible, risk-based, and comprehensive cybersecurity program. The \\nframework itself is not a standard; rather, it is an approach developed in consensus with industry \\nthat is based on standards. The core of the framework includes five functions: identify, protect, \\ndetect, respond, and recover. The functions are broken down further into subcategories and \\ncross-referenced with other commonly used standards. The framework provides the basis for the \\nPractice Guide. The full mapping of the Practice Guide to the Cybersecurity Framework can be \\nfound in Appendix A. 4.2.6 Risk Management of Enterprise Mobility Including Bring Your Own Device The Risk Management of Enterprise Mobility Including Bring Your Own Device published by \\nASD provides relevant information for organizations considering deploying a bring your own \\ndevice (BYOD) policy. It explores risk tolerance and business usage; however, it is not included \\nin our mapping because its focus is on business cases rather than practical implementation \\nguidelines. 4.2.7 Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) The Protective Security Policy Framework, authored by Australias Attorney-Generals \\nDepartment, takes a broad approach to security that includes governance, personnel security, \\ninformation security, and physical security. Australian government agencies are required to \\ncomply with its 36 requirements, and it is provided to state and territory governments as a \\nholistic model for public-sector security management. Because it is a high-level document \\nwithout a direct correlation to the technical recommendations in the Practice Guide and it applies \\nto the Australian government, it is not included in the mapping provided in the next section. \\n16 4.2.8 Information Security Manual The ISM, authored by ASD, is the flagship document for the application of risk-based \\ninformation security principles and controls for Australian government agencies, thereby \\nfunctioning as the standard that governs the security of Australian government information and \\ncommunication technology (ICT) systems. [24]. The ISMs suggested audience is Information \\nTechnology Security Advisors, Information Technology Security Managers, Information \\nSecurity Registered Assessors and other security practitioners across government. The role and \\ntechnical skill level of this audience is similar to the Practice Guides target audience in its Part \\nB, which is focused on chief information officers, chief information security officers, and \\nsecurity managers. While the ISM is focused on federal agencies, it is mapped to the Practice \\nGuide because of its flagship status on Australian cybersecurity. 4.2.9 Information Security Management Guidelines: Risk Management of \\nOutsourced ICT Arrangements Information Security Management Guidelines: Risk Management of Outsourced ICT \\nArrangements (Including Cloud), authored by Australias Attorney-Generals Department, is \\nintended for government agencies. While much of the information included in this document \\nmay benefit any organization considering cloud services, it is tailored to government needs only. \\nAlso, it is primarily aimed at the organizational and policy levels. Thus, it is not included in the \\nmapping of the Practice Guide. 4.2.10 Information Security Registered Assessors Program (IRAP) IRAP is an ASD initiative to ensure that individuals conducting cybersecurity assessments have \\nan appropriate skill level to produce consistent quality. IRAP is not a standard, though it is often \\nmistaken to be such; rather, it demonstrates that IRAP members have attained the experience, \\nsecurity certifications, and technical understanding to independently assess systems against the \\nISM and Protective Security Policy Framework. This program is especially important for entities \\nthat desire to provide IT services to Australian government agencies (and increasingly adopted \\nby state and territory governments) due to the ASDs recommendation of compliance with IRAP \\nbefore procurement. IRAP is included on the list of identified standards as MITRE research \\nfound it frequently referenced, at times, as if it were a standard. IRAP leverages the ISM as a \\nbasis for assessment of technical controls for services that go through the accreditation process. \\nIt does not apply in the context of mobile device security for SMEs. Because it is not an actual \\nstandard and applies only to government or entities opting in to IRAP, it is not mapped to the \\nPractice Guide. 4.2.11 Privacy Guidelines The Office of the Australian Information Comminssioners (OAIC) Guide to Securing Personal \\nInformation provides technical guidelines that businesses can use to comply with the Australian \\nPrivacy Principles requirements [25]. This research uses the Guide to Securing Personal \\nInformation as a basis for mapping to the guidelines found in the Practice Guide. It is important \\nto note that this mapping is limited to the extent that the findings and recommendations from the \\nOAIC guidelines are limited to personal information and that the Practice Guide includes any \\ndata. Additionally, the OAIC guide includes specific reference to mobile devices that were not \\n17 included in the mapping in this report. General guidelines are provided for businesses to adopt \\npolicies regarding the use of mobile devices, including the separation of business and personal \\ndata, password protection, and an awareness program for employees regarding the risks of using \\npersonal devices for business activities. \\nWhile the OAIC guide is beneficial to organizations with mobile devices, it lacks the technical \\nspecificity necessary for mapping to the Practice Guide. Additionally, the Guide to Securing \\nPersonal Information refers to the OAICs Mobile PrivacyA Better Practice Guide for \\nMobile App Developers [26]. While useful for entities that develop mobile applications within \\ntheir own organizations, the Practice Guide used mobile applications provided by commercial \\nvendors and therefore did not include any mobile application development recommendations for \\nprivacy protection. For the purposes of the project, it is assumed that most SMEs will be users of \\nmobile applications and not developers of mobile applications. However, in circumstances where \\nAustralian organizations, particularly start-ups, develop applications to support their businesses, \\nthis guide is useful. Laws, Standards, and Guidelines Mapping \\nMITRE analyzed the laws, standards, and guidelines identified in Section 4 of this report and \\ndetermined that three of the documents were directly relevant to mobile device security \\nguidelines contained within the Practice Guide. This section provides a detailed analysis showing \\nhow the most relevant Australian laws, standards, and guidelines map to the Practice Guide. It \\nincludes tables that illustrate how specific controls found in the Australian documents align to \\ncomparable elements within the Practice Guide. For example, in Table 2, which compares the \\nISM to the Practice Guide, the Security Characteristic column identifies elements from the \\nPractice Guide that are needed to reduce the risk from mobile devices storing or accessing \\nenterprise data. The Example Capability column, taken from the Practice Guide, identifies \\ntechnical features that can be applied to address the accompanied security characteristic. The \\nfinal column, Information Security Manual Control, shows how technical controls align to the Practice Guides corresponding security characteristics. 5.1 Information Security Manual \\nThis section maps the ISM Control Manual to guidelines found in the Practice Guide. This section also uses visual representations to make the mapping easy to understand. We began \\nby identifying the six security characteristics from the Practice Guide and representing them as \\nhexagons in a heat map. The color of each hexagon represents the degree of overlap between the \\nAustralian document and the Practice Guide. In the ISM mapping, green denotes that the \\nPractice Guide security characteristic was mapped",
