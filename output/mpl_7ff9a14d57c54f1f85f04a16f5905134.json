  "text": "methods of \\ncombat actions and the content of command and control over tactical military formations.25 \\nSome of the forms and methods were said to be cyber-warfare, cyber-engagement, cyber-\\naction, and cyber-attack.26 27 Kh. I. Sayfetdinov, Information Confrontation in the Military Sphere, Voennaya Mysl (Military Thought), No. 7 2014, p. 38.\\n28 Ibid., p. 39.\\n29 Ibid., pp. 40-41.\\n30 Ibid., p. 41.\\n31 K. A. Trotsenko, Information Confrontation at the Operational-Tactical Level of Control, Voennaya Mysl (Military \\nThought), No. 8 2016, p. 20.\\n32 Ibid., p. 21. In 2014, Major General (retired) Kh. I. Sayfetdinov wrote on battlefield operations. He defined \\ninformation warfare as the conscious employment of information to enable the user to achieve \\nhis political, economic, military, or any other goals.27 The objective of such operations is to gain \\nand hold information superiority over an adversary and to create favorable conditions for the \\nArmed Forces. Operations must be conducted constantly, in peacetime and wartime.28 \\nInformation operation tasks include monitoring information sources to detect, assess, and \\npredict information-related threats to Russia; deceiving adversaries as to Russias plans and \\nintentions; disorganizing the adversarys government and military command and control \\ncapability; impairing the psychological stability of adversary forces; and maintaining the morale \\nand psychological state of friendly forces.29 Subsystems of an information operations system \\nwould include the ability to attack an adversarys technical information capabilities and protect \\nfriendly systems from adversary attacks; software and hardware capabilities; reconnaissance, to \\ninclude electronic reconnaissance capabilities; electronic warfare; and psychological warfare \\nagainst an adversary, while protecting friendly forces from similar attacks by an adversary.30 In 2016, Colonel K. A. Trotsenko discussed operational-tactical control levels. Initially he \\ndiscussed the basic structure and understanding of information confrontations in Russia. His \\nexplanation contained the familiar division of information operations into information-technical \\n(computers, electronics, etc.) and information-psychological (influencing the public and armed \\nforces of an adversary). He added that this definition is strategic. At the tactical and operational \\nlevels, the focus is more on organizing control and electronic warfare capabilities.31 Attaining a \\ntactical goal can be determined by the degree of information superiority one has over an \\nopponent and the time available to forestall adversary actions. He explains: Informational confrontation in preparing and conducting tactical actions is, \\ntherefore, to imply a set of measures for organizing and effecting control, \\nreconnaissance, electronic warfare, security, tactical camouflage, fire destruction \\nof the adversary control systems, use of highly maneuverable units and certain \\nkinds of maneuvers coordinated in terms of time, place, mission, and aimed at \\nachieving superiority in controlling, deceiving, and forestalling the adversary in its \\nactions.32 Conclusions3\\nThis article was designed to show that Russias approach to cyber and information operations is \\nthoughtful and innovative, focused on being covert and manipulative, and yet still repetitious \\ndue to its use of specific concepts from Soviet days. Thoughtful in that it integrates new \\ntechnologies, concepts, and approaches to cyber affairs as they develop; covert and \\nmanipulative in the many ways it attempts to force its objective reality on other populations 33 V. I. Tsymbal, The Concept of Information Warfare, Presentation at a September 1995 conference in Moscow, Russia, p. 7. through reflexive control and other mass media methods; and repetitious in that many of the \\ntechniques used earlier are still adaptable to current conditions as Russia continues to divide \\ninformation warfare into information-technical and information-psychological aspects. This is a far cry from where Russia first started in the early 1990s. During a September 1995 \\nconference in Moscow, for example, Russian information expert V. I. Tsymbal stated that the \\nuse of information warfare forces against Russia would be considered a military phase of \\nconflict, even if there was no loss of life. More ominously, he added: In studying the potential catastrophic consequences from an enemys use of \\nstrategic IW systems on, for example, the economy or government controlwe \\nmust unequivocally declare that in the case of their use against Russia, we \\nreserve the right to conduct a first strike (nuclear) against the IW system and \\nforces which are directing that weapon, and then also against the aggressor-\\ngovernment.33 The warning was unambiguous. There apparently was a desire to use the conference to transmit \\na message to the US leadership, if it hadnt made its way there earlier through other channels, \\nthat the thought of an information warfare attack on Russias weak infrastructure would be an \\nact of war leading to a devastating attack on the other side. Whether the conference message \\nreflected actual operational plans or was used simply for deterrent purposes is not known. \\nToday, since Russia has developed numerous information and cyber specialists, it is less likely \\nthat Russia would answer a cyber-attack against its infrastructure with a nuclear strike. It would \\nbe more likely that Russia would unleash its own powerful information strike against such an \\nadversary. The analysis prompts a host of questions and suppositions about what Russias end goals might \\nbe. Specifically, US attention should focus on Russias desire to achieve information superiority \\nin the initial period of war; Russian attempts to manipulate objective reality to its benefit; the \\ncontinued application of specific media tactics and reflexive control deception; and the various \\ntemplates Russia is developing, either wittingly or unwittingly, to achieve their goals. For the \\nU.S., these issues should become priority considerations. Understanding where Russia is \\nheading, what techniques of persuasion they are using, and how they are shaping a future \\npotential battlefield are all important considerations. There is also one other very important fact \\nto keep in mind and that is for analysts to stop trying to mirror image U.S. thinking onto Russias \\nway of conducting military affairs. Russia has its own priorities, concerns, and way of military \\nthought. It is only through a conceptualization of Russias framework of military thought that its \\nactions can be understood. Without that lens, analysts are likely to be led down some false \\nroads. Russia will not go quietly into the night, as demonstrated by its addition of more military muscle \\nand its persistence to worry incessantly about NATO. Russian activities, as a result, need to \\ncontinue to be monitored closely. Some actions need to be confronted directly, either through \\nnegotiations or through the development and implementation of new US security measures. A greater focus on the contours of Russian military thought would also be of the upmost \\nimportance in trying to decipher where the nations leadership is taking them. _Toc293499070\\n _Toc468868719\\n _Toc468869305\\n _Toc516035091\\n _Toc516035092\\n _Toc516035093\\n _Toc516035094\\n _Toc516035095\\n _Toc516035096\\n _Toc516035097\\n _Toc516035098\\n _Toc516035099\\n _Toc516035100\\n _Toc516035101\\n _Toc516035102 \",",
