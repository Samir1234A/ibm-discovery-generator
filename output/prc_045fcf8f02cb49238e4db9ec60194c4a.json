  "text": "    \"text\": \" In Singapore, a New Way of Analyzing Land Use Around Airports Land can be hard to come by in the prosperous island state of Singapore. MITRE is helping \\nSingapore's Civil Aviation Authority decide if it can release land near Changi Airport for \\ndevelopment without compromising the safety of air operations. Airports place development restrictions on surrounding land. That's not surprisingthey need obstacle-\\nfree airspace for safety. But this creates a natural tension between airspace protection and economic \\nexpansion. Add in the land limitations of an island-based country, such as Singapore, and competition for \\nusable land becomes significant. Singapore is a global commerce, finance, and transport hub with a state-of-the-art airport, Changi, that \\nserves as an aviation center for Southeast Asia. The country's territory consists of one main island and 62 \\nislets. Land reclamation efforts have increased Singapore's area by more than 20 percent since it \\nachieved independence in the 1960s, but acreage to build on remains a scarce resource. There are frequent requests from land use agencies for restrictions near the airports to be relaxed. The \\nCivil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), in considering these requests, will ensure that safe \\noperations are not compromised. An Imaginary Surface with Real Consequences CAAS safeguards airspace near Changi by applying Obstacle Limitation Surfaces (OLS). OLS are imaginary \\nsurfaces that emanate from an airport. They define the volume of airspace that must be kept free from \\nobstacles to allow for the safe operation of aircraft. OLS standards have existed fundamentally unchanged at airports around the world for decades. But \\naircraft performance, navigation systems, and flight procedure capabilities continually evolve, which \\nallows for much more precise arrival and departure paths. Flight tracking capabilities also continue to \\nadvance. The evolution of all these capabilities creates new data that researchers can analyze to refine \\nrequirements for protecting airspace. CAAS is willing to evaluate the OLS at Changi and consider adjusting them without compromising safety \\nof air operations. This is where MITRE can help. The Right Data Helps Set the Boundaries CAAS sponsors MITRE's first research and development center outside of the United StatesMITRE Asia \\nPacific Singapore (MAPS). Via this partnership, we're conducting a study to help CAAS determine if the \\ncurrent OLS can be modified. \\\"First, we'll evaluate every aspect of every surface being considered,\\\" says Neal Westlund, MITRE's \\nairport design and analysis group leader. \\\"Then we'll tell them which ones have the potential to be \\nrelaxed and how much they could be relaxed. If CAAS decides its OLS can be modified, then our study will \\nalso help them choose the safest and most effective modification strategy.\\\" During the study, MITRE developed an analytical framework that presents the performance parameters, http://www.changiairport.com/\\nhttp://www.changiairport.com/\\nhttp://www.changiairport.com/\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/news/press-releases/mitre-partners-with-civil-aviation-authority-of-singapore-caas-to-support\\nhttp://www.mitre-ap.sg/\\nhttp://www.mitre-ap.sg/ safety factors, and logical arguments fundamental to the purpose of an OLS. The framework identifies \\nwhat data to gather and which metrics to analyze. A New Framework with World-Wide Relevance Our OLS Assessment Framework offers a systematic, data-based approach to characterizing and updating \\ncurrent boundaries. Theoretically, it could be used at any airport in the world. \\n\\\"Many companies perform analyses of OLS,\\\" Westlund says. \\\"But we're developing a new method that \\nsimplifies the comparison of obstacle surfaces to assess the feasibility of modernizing them. We're taking \\nthis beyond just aviation expertise and adding modern technology capabilities in data-driven analyses \\nusing GIS [Geographic Information Systems]. Our GIS expertise has allowed us to develop an enhanced, \\nthree-dimensional analysis methodology, with three-dimensional visualizations.\\\" The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized agency of the United Nations that \\noversees international air travel, has called for a review of existing guidelines regarding OLS. Westlund \\nhopes the framework will be useful in these efforts at other airports. As an operator of federally funded research and development centers, our sponsors and customers \\nprovide us with trusted access to needed data. \\\"ICAO doesn't have access to the data to support the type \\nof research we're doing,\\\" Westlund says. \\\"But data-driven analysis for aviation is MITRE's thing. We focus \\non ways to take advantage of new technology while keeping safety the number-one priority.\\\" by Kathy Chamlee \\nApproved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.
