  "text": "Labor (DOL) points to the practice as \\na proven solution for businesses and agencies to \\nrecruit, train, and retain highly skilled workers Reg-\\nistered Apprentice, the DOL program, offers a quick \\nstart toolkit to help organizations establish viable \\nefforts, reporting that approximately 400,000 \\napprentices participate in 20,000 such programs \\neach year Possible partners for these programs \\ninclude labor organizations, local K-12 programs, \\neconomic development agencies, community col-\\nleges, state apprenticeship agencies, community \\norganizations, and nonprofits and foundations 20 The University of Maryland, Baltimore County \\n(UMBC) program is another example Originally \\ndeveloped for the Department of Defense and \\nthe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) the \\nUMBC 10-year vetted course in cybersecurity \\nleads to a career as a certified cybersecurity \\noperator analyst 21 At the state level, Californias \\nformal nontraditional apprenticeships and \\npartnerships with the community college system \\nprovide evening classes, enabling a mutually \\nbeneficial relationship for both recruiting and \\ncurriculum development 22 Actions\\nPartner with the private sector and academia to \\nestablish agreements with community colleges and \\nonline learning institutes Prioritize the development of training and apprentice-\\nship programs that focus on cybersecurity or other \\nin-demand skills and difficult-to-fill positions Leverage established apprenticeship programs, (e g , \\nthe Department of Labors Registered Apprentice \\nprogram) as well as private sector and academic \\nengagement to increase opportunities for veterans \\nwho want to transition from the military or develop \\nnew skills Considerations: Agencies must balance identifying early talent \\nwith the need to have a competitive process \\nthat encourages a broad range of applicants \\nand provides opportunities that are consistent \\nwith Merit Systems Principles Veteran advocacy groups could be helpful \\npartners in identifying candidates for \\napprenticeship programs Cybersecurity apprenticeship programs such as the one forged by the \\ngovernor of Maryland, Maryland Department of Labor, and University of \\nMaryland Baltimore County allow participants to earn semester credits \\ntoward degree programs, while also receiving the on-the-job training \\nand classroom instruction in a traditional apprenticeship 21The MITRE Corporation Build training and reskilling \\ninto technology procurements Purpose and practice: Integrating reskilling \\nand upskilling requirements into government \\nprocurements for technology and services can help \\nprepare employees for the impact of the change \\nTraining and reskilling can help employees develop \\nthe knowledge, skills, and abilities required to \\nunderstand and use the technology and adjust to \\nthe changing nature of their work It is a common \\npractice to include user training in purchases for \\nsoftware or new systems, and that is sufficient \\nwhen the primary change impacting the employee \\nis the transition from one tool to another But the \\nmore significant challenge arises when the solution \\nbeing acquired fundamentally changes the work \\nand the way that work is performed Movement to digital platforms, wider use of \\nrobotics and artificial intelligence, continual \\nsoftware updates in Cloud environments, and \\nthe large volumes of available data are just a \\nfew drivers of growing complexity in the work \\nenvironment While automation can increase \\nproductivity and reduce the need for some \\nforms of manual work, it also introduces new \\nrequirements, new complexities, and new data into \\nthe work itself To address this, some organizations \\nare including in their technology procurements the \\nrequirement that solution providers or separate \\norganizations offer training on the work, not just \\nthe product Doing so can accomplish several \\nthings, including: developing an understanding of the new way \\nof working and interacting with the system and \\nwith others creating awareness of new possibilitiesthe \\nhigher-value activities that the employee \\ncan now perform because of the change \\nto what they do (e g automating data \\ncollection, cataloguing, or other largely \\nroutine or administrative functions creates \\nthe opportunity to focus on more analytics, \\ndecision-making, or knowledge work) establishing early adopters within the \\nworkforce These individuals can serve as \\ncoaches and advocates, increasing employee \\nengagement and understanding during \\nacquisition processes that might otherwise \\ncause concerns about job security Actions\\nExplore the impact of this practice on key modern-\\nization initiatives Work with a solution provider to define the type of \\nadditional training needed to reskill or upskill the \\nworkforce impacted by a specific modernization \\nsolution Consider coupling this approach with the moderniza-\\ntion Centers of Excellence (COE) effort This will cre-\\nate a reference model that could be used to provide \\nguidance to the acquisition community to incorporate \\nrelevant language into procurements Consider this as a potential initiative on which to col-\\nlaborate with labor Considerations: Success would require that functional subject \\nmatter experts (SMEs) be made available by \\nthe supplier In some cases, the supplier may \\nhave only the technology expertise Therefore \\nthe government should consider how to get \\nthis additional work training if not available \\nthrough the supplier itself This may affect the cost of these \\nprocurements The government should \\nconsider how to include the opportunity \\ncost and the cost of other alternatives \\n(e g , government-provided reskilling) in the \\nevaluation of these procurements 22 Report Symposium on the Federal Workforce for the 21st Century expertise to design and develop an internal, \\nemployee questionnaire Specific to the Census \\nemployee experience, the survey aimed to help \\nimplement policies, practices, and procedures \\nto improve the Bureau and was created by a \\ncross-directorate work group of managers and \\nemployees with a focus on actionable results \\nThe results helped guide the implementation of \\nappropriate and realistic activities, policies, and \\nprocedures to reach goals outlined in the U S \\nCensus Bureau Business Plan for Change Actions:\\nIdentify an initiative with shared interest and goals on \\nwhich to collaborate Explore reskilling initiatives as opportunities to col-\\nlaborate, given the benefits to both labor and man-\\nagemente g , managers want to obtain hard-to-fill \\nknowledge, skills, and abilities, and labor wants to \\nprovide developmental opportunities that result in \\nhigher salaries or continued employment Begin collaborative projects with a shared under-\\nstanding of the agency and employee needs and \\nmutually beneficial priorities, especially those that \\nleverage in-house expertise Collaborate with labor \\norganizations on an initiative \\nwith clear outcomes and \\nshared interests Purpose and practice: Symposium \\nparticipants were optimistic about opportunities \\nfor more collaborative conversations between \\nlabor organizations and management Participants \\nrecommended three essential practices: \\nembracing a cooperative labor-management \\nleadership model for the initiative, developing \\nadvocates among the early adopters to support \\ncommunication and build trust, and allowing \\nparticipants to shape the effort to ensure that it is \\npractical, while encouraging their commitment and \\nbuy-in One exemplar discussed was the voluntary \\nPortsmouth Shipyard Renewal of Shipyard \\nValues and Pride (RSVP) program, which utilized \\nmechanisms for sharing ideas and concerns \\ntransparently, and for solving problems together The U S Census Bureau is another example of \\nhow management and labor collaborate to engage \\nemployees on proactive solutions For example, \\nthe Census Organizational Climate Survey (OCS) \\nharnessed the Bureaus internal survey statistical 23The MITRE Corporation Considerations: A baseline level of mutual trust and open \\ncommunication is an essential starting point \\nfor working on shared goals Participation in such programs should be \\nvoluntary Establish a talent marketplace \\nto increase mobility \\nopportunities Purpose and practice: Trends suggest \\nthat todays professionals value flexible career \\npaths, lateral moves to allow for diverse job \\nexperiences, and opportunities for lifelong \\nlearning While employees frequently cite their \\ndedication to mission, they also frequently \\ncriticize federal agencies for providing insufficient \\nopportunities for personal development and \\ncareer advancement To address these perceptions, the government \\nshould consider using a cross-governmental talent \\nmarketplace; USAJOBS may be a foundation on \\nwhich to build this more robust tool A marketplace \\napproach would serve four purposes: better align \\ntalent with work demands, enable greater mobility \\nand visibility for career planning for employees, \\nprovide transparent developmental rotation \\nopportunities, and capture the evolving skills \\nof government employees 23 The transparency \\nand wide range of options provided via a talent \\nmarketplace would allow government employees to \\nactively participate in shaping their career paths The government currently has programs that \\nenable rotations as part of leadership development \\nprograms such as the Presidential Management \\nFellows Program (PMF), agency Senior Executive \\nServices Candidate Development Programs (SES \\nCDP), and Presidents Management Council (PMC) \\nInteragency Rotation Program These opportunities \\nshould be leveraged more across all agencies An example of a large agency that is providing a \\nbroad range of rotations to a large workforce is DHS DHS introduced a Joint Duty Program that \\nprovides one-year detail assignments across \\nits agencies (e g , U S Coast Guard, Federal \\nEmergency Management Agency) Smaller \\nagencies without the breadth of DHS would \\nbenefit from connecting with other agencies to \\nfoster career growth, and a talent marketplace can provide that connecting point Actions:\\nExplore the viability of USAJOBS as the platform on \\nwhich to build a talent marketplace, while also ad-\\ndressing concerns about user experience, specifically \\nease of searchability and clarity of the vacancy 24 Utilize the talent marketplace not simply as a \\njob-posting system, but more broadly as a talent-\\ninventory portal that allows employees to constantly \\nupdate their skills, competencies, training, technical \\ncredentials, and development goals Considerations: A critical success factor will be to create an \\neffective funding strategy for developmental \\nrotations; under current policy, the home \\nmanager is often constrained by continuing to \\nsupport the salary of the detailed employee \\nwhile struggling to maintain resources for \\nongoing operations in the home office This \\ncan be
