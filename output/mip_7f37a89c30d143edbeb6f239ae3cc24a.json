  "text": "awareness. In a follow-on study, Peterson, Penhallegon, and Moertl (2012) also examined IM during en\\nroute metering but with different levels of equipage and new controller display interfaces. They\\nexamined center controller acceptability of IM procedures and requirements for ground\\nautomation and reported general controller acceptance of IM and the interface. They also\\nreported that controllers could acceptably manage a mix of IM and non-IM aircraft. Controllers\\nalso found metering and IM to be compatible, though they reported some workload issues at\\nhigher levels of IM equipage due to the communication requirements associated with issuing\\nthe IM clearance and with managing off-nominal situations. Overall, controllers reported having\\nall the necessary information to conduct IM operations and that IM information in spacing list\\nand data block locations was acceptable. The authors recommended further examination of IM\\nin the TRACON, including aircraft already conducting IM transitioning into the TRACON. Rognin et al. (2005) also conducted a simulation examining IM with a en route metering\\ncapability. Aircraft transitioned into the TRACON, but there was no terminal metering tool.\\nControllers were provided new tools to manage IM aircraft. Overall, controllers found IM and\\nen route metering to be compatible and complementary. TRACON controllers reported 2-14 favorably upon receiving aircraft already conducting IM from the en route environment\\nbecause the transfer conditions were more stable. 2.4.2 Past Research on IM and Terminal Metering with TSAS\\nThe main body of work to examine IM in a terminal area metering environment was conducted\\nby NASA under the Air Traffic management Demonstration-1 (ATD-1) umbrella of activities. The\\nmajority of the HITL simulations are summarized in Robinson et al. (2015). That work will be\\nreviewed next from the perspective of the controller, because from the flight crew perspective,\\nboth the metering and non-metering environment look very similar. Flight crew procedures do\\nnot change between the environments and the receipt of a time-based ASG may be the only\\nindication to the flight crew that they are in a metering environment. 2.4.2.1 NASA ATD-1 Concept of Operations\\nNASAs ATD-1 activity started in 2011 to develop, demonstrate, and transfer time-based\\nspacing capabilities to the FAA. The ATD-1 concept is very similar to the time-based metering\\nenvironment and the IM concept as described in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. In the ATD-1 concept, en\\nroute controllers manage and meter aircraft via TBFM to deliver them to the TRACON boundary\\nsuch that speed alone should achieve the schedule. Aircraft fly PBN arrival procedures with\\nspeed and altitude constraints. For aircraft that are equipped, the en route controller can issue\\nan IM clearance (sometimes with an associated STA). If an STA is provided, it is entered in the\\nflight deck and flown until IM can begin. En route controllers hand off aircraft near the terminal\\nboundary with a schedule error of less than 30 40 seconds (Robinson et al., 2015). Terminal\\ncontrollers use TSAS to continue to manage and meter aircraft. They also monitor on-going IM\\noperations. The final controller may also use the Automated Terminal Proximity Alert (ATPA)\\ncapability to monitor separation as aircraft join the final approach. ATD-1 activities ended in\\n2017 with a flight test of the flight deck IM component (Swieringa et al., 2017). 2.4.2.2 NASA ATD-1 Controller HITLs\\nBetween 2012 and 2014, NASA conducted sixteen simulations under the ATD-1 activity with\\ncontrollers as participants (Robinson et al., 2015). Some simulations included IM and others did\\nnot. Of the sixteen simulations, seven had published reports on IM and TSAS integration with\\ncontroller participants. A report on an additional HITL simulation became available in 2016\\n(Baxley et al., 2016). Table 2-2 shows the dates and key papers for these simulations. In these simulations, controller participants were either active or retired controllers. In many\\ncases, the same controllers participated in multiple simulations. Overall, the ATD-1 IM TSAS\\nwork with controllers as participants included a low percentage (approximately 10-20%) of IM\\naircraft. However, some of the simulations appeared to have fewer IM aircraft (e.g., three IM\\naircraft in a 75 aircraft per hour run in Thipphavong et al. 2013) or did not have IM as part of\\nthe main focus (e.g., Wynnyk and Kopald, 2013). Baxley et al. (2016) was a notable exception\\nthat had a high level of IM aircraft. High level summaries and results are summarized here and\\nspecific, relevant details are discussed in Section 2.5.1. 2-15 Table 2-2.

(2016) CA Controller Managed Spacing (CMS) Air Traffic management Demonstration (ATD) FIAT Fully Integrated ATD-1 Test TSS Terminal Sequencing and Spacing IMAC IM Alternative Clearances The first ATD-1 simulation examining TSAS and IM integration was CA-1, as reported in Cabrall\\net al. (2012). Nine controllers were participants (acting as TRACON and center controllers).\\nControllers were asked to not interfere with IM operations, even if there was a spacing issue,\\nto enable close examination of the behavior of the [IM] algorithm in an operational setting\\n(Cabrall et al., 2012, p. 6). Eight aircraft were equipped with flight deck IM equipment. Controllers reported acceptable workload, tools, procedures, and phraseology for the\\nintegrated operations and that they were able to integrate IM traffic into their operations. The\\nauthors did indicate, however, that there were some spacing issues with IM aircraft, which\\nseemed to be due to lack of conditioning aircraft prior to initiating IM operations. When using\\nthe TSAS tools (e.g., early / late indicators, slot markers, timeline) as well as the IM data block\\nindicators for IM, feeder controllers indicated that the timeline and data block indicators were\\nboth helpful and useful. Their replies also indicated higher helpfulness ratings but lower\\nusability ratings for the slot markers and early / late indicators for IM, even if both showed\\nlarge schedule errors for IM aircraft. However, controllers seemed to want the tools to help\\nmanage IM operations. Final controller ratings were not provided. Controllers reported\\nfavorably on manually interacting with the IM status designators and also reported few issues\\nwith the IM clearance. In the follow-on / CA-2 simulation, the focus was on pre-conditioning the traffic (Callantine et\\nal., 2012). Center and TRACON controllers were participants. Eight aircraft were IM-equipped.\\nThe same IM status designators and update methods for the TRACON controllers that were\\nused for CA-1 were used for CA-2. Some conditions removed the slot markers and speed\\nadvisories for aircraft conducting IM. Results reporting was limited; however, the IM results\\nthat were reported indicated that pre-conditioning the IM traffic overcame the IM aircraft 2-16 delivery problems seen in CA-1. Additionally, center and TRACON controllers reported finding\\nthe IM status designators in the data block useful. The CA-3 HITL built on the previous simulations and examined controller tools, procedures, and\\nphraseology (Callantine et al. 2012), but with different IM status designators. Approximately\\n11% of the aircraft were IM-equipped. Center and TRACON controllers were participants.\\nOverall, controller replies indicated that the tools, procedures, and phraseology were\\nacceptable and useful. Controllers reported that mixed IM and TSAS operations were not an\\nissue. For this simulation, when controllers were considering terminating IM, they were\\nencouraged to suspend IM instead, so they could resume IM at a later point. Center controllers\\nsuspended some IM operations, mostly due to concerns with separation at merge points. The\\nresults indicate that IM reduced the inter-arrival spacing variation as compared to aircraft only\\nconducting TSAS operations and that trail aircraft conformed to the underlying schedule when\\nthe lead aircraft did. One noted issue was the high number of issues with IM communications.\\nThe authors do not provide much detail on the exact nature of the concerns, but acknowledged\\nthat it needed to be addressed. FIAT-1 was conducted to further evaluate the ATD-1 operational concept and its validity\\n(Thipphavong et al. 2013). There were three IM-equipped aircraft per run in a demand of\\naround 75 aircraft per an hour run. In some scenarios, the lead aircraft was not in the same\\nsector as the trail aircraft. Center and TRACON controllers were participants. Overall, IM\\noperations worked with the TSAS operations. The authors again confirmed the need to pre-\\ncondition aircraft so that speed changes alone will be sufficient to achieve the desired spacing\\nin the TRACON. When aircraft were on the same route, an IM operation was more likely to be\\nengaged than when the aircraft were not on the same route. All controllers reported\\nmanageable workload, though the center controllers reported higher workload than the\\nTRACON controllers and increased communications with IM aircraft (as compared to non-IM\\naircraft). Both could be attributed to the requirement to issue the IM clearance. TRACON\\ncontrollers reported lower workload than the center controllers and reported communicating\\nwith the IM aircraft the same or less than non-IM aircraft. For the majority of responses, there were no reported spacing issues for IM aircraft pairs and\\nnon-IM aircraft did not need to be maneuvered for IM aircraft pairs. Aircraft in IM pairs spent\\nless time off path than the non-IM pairs. When compared to aircraft not conducing IM, aircraft\\nthat were conducting IM showed worse schedule conformance at the meter fixes and meter\\npoints in the feeder airspace, but were spaced closer with less variance at the FAF. Controllers\\nreported mismatches between the trail aircraft position and the slot marker. This behavior is\\nexpected based",
