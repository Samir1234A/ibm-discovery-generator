  "text": "and closing on the IM\\nspeed. The IM speeds were coupled to the autothrottle so the flight crew did not enter the IM\\nspeeds through the Mode Control Panel (MCP). The Multifunction Control and Display Unit\\n(MCDU) was used for set-up and provided the same information as that in Oseguera-Lohr et al.\\n(2002). In a summary of this work, Baxley et al. (2014) stated the spacing position indicator was\\nagain problematic (e.g., low usefulness ratings, over-control issues) and that it should be\\nremoved or improved. 2-34 Figure 2-19. PFD and Navigation Display with IM Features from Barmore et al. (2005)\\n[Reprinted from Baxley et al., 2014 (Highlights Added)] Murdoch, Barmore, Baxley, Abbott, and Capron (2009) conducted an IM HITL simulation during\\noptimized RNAV routes. The objectives of the HITL were to assess pilot ability and acceptability\\nof IM procedures during nominal and off-nominal situations and to evaluate human and system\\nperformance in terms of aircraft spacing and system performance. Two separate simulation\\nplatforms were used and the displays are shown in Figure 2-20 and Figure 2-21. It can be seen\\nin the PFD and navigation display in Figure 2-20 that elements have been removed (relative to\\nthe previous simulation) and only the IM speed and mode are shown on the PFD. Also, only the\\ntarget aircraft highlighting is shown on the navigation display. The same is true with Figure\\n2-21, except the spacing position indicator also appears to have been used. The MCDU was\\nused for set-up and provided IM information during conduct. Using subjective measures of\\nacceptability, completeness of procedures, and workload, Murdoch et al. (2009) found overall\\nfavorability of IM and the tools across nominal and off-nominal events. 2-35 Figure 2-20. PFD and Navigation Display with IM Features Implementation 1 from Murdoch et\\nal. (2009) [Reprinted from Baxley et al., 2014] Figure 2-21. PFD and Navigation Display with IM Features Implementation 2 from Murdoch et\\nal. (2009) [Reprinted from Baxley et al., 2014] Baxley et al. (2013) conducted an IM HITL simulation during dependent runway operations.\\nController Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) was used to convey and load the IM\\nclearance information into the flight deck IM equipment. The MCDU was used for set-up and\\nprovided IM information during conduct. Three separate simulation platforms were used. The\\nPFDs are shown in Figure 2-22. As can be seen, the IM speeds were shown above the airspeed\\ntape and as a bug alongside the airspeed tape. A green box was placed around a new IM speed 2-36 for 10 seconds. Pilots were also notified if the IM speed was limited due to procedural speeds.\\nPilots were notified if they were greater than 6 knots above the IM speed (by an Engine-\\nIndicating and Crew-Alerting System [EICAS] message). No early / late (progress) indicator or\\nfast / slow indicator was present. For the navigation displays, the only IM feature included was\\nthe highlighting of the target aircraft, except for one exploratory run where a conformance box\\nwas shown (Figure 2-23). The conformance box showed the band within which it was still\\npossible to reach the ASG by the ABP. The goal of the box was to provide better spacing\\npredictability. Spacing error was presented on the MCDU. Figure 2-22. PFDs with IM Features from Baxley et al. (2013) [Reprinted from Baxley et al.,\\n2013] Figure 2-23. Navigation Display with IM Features from Baxley et al. (2013) [Reprinted from\\nBaxley et al., 2013] 2-37 Pilots reported general acceptance of the display elements but the majority reported wanting a\\nmore salient speed change notification such as flashing or an associated aural alert. Pilots also\\nreported a strong preference for a progress indicator and the ability to predict new IM speeds.\\nSome comments indicated that the pilots may have had a poor mental model of the\\nrelationship between the spacing error and the IM speeds and the conformance box did not\\nhelp much with the issue or pilot comfort in IM. However, the conformance box did provide\\nuseful information for IM operations about the current time error relative to the tolerance\\nboundary. Pilot reported it should be a tool available for IM. The authors recommended\\nexamining tools that provide a clear indication of the relationship between the time error and\\nthe arrival of new IM speeds and a tool similar to the conformance box showing the current\\nstatus and trend of IM. Spacing error was only shown on the first IM page on the MCDU and the\\nauthors were concerned about the amount of time the crews would spend viewing the MCDU\\npage for this key piece of information. Flight crews were reported to use the spacing error\\ninformation but not spending excessive amounts of time referencing the MCDU. NASA continued the IM work under its ATD-1 activity. Kibler et al. (2015) examined IM\\noperations in a HITL simulation that used an auxiliary / Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) display\\nlocation and an Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Guidance Display (AGD).\\nIn this simulation, the EFB was used to enter the IM information. The AGD had a fast / slow\\nindicator and the IM speed (Figure 2-24). New IM speeds were annunciated with a Light-\\nEmitting Diode (LED) light on the AGD. The EFB display hosted the CDTI traffic display (Figure\\n2-25). The traffic display included spacing information such the IM speed, a fast / slow\\nindicator, and the ASG. The fast / slow indicator provided trend and acceleration and deceleration information and was\\nnot simply an indication of whether the aircrafts current IAS or MCP speed matched the IM\\nspeed. It was designed to assist the flight crew with matching the acceleration / deceleration\\nprofile expected by the IM algorithm. The NASA algorithm attempts to keep the number of IM\\nspeeds low (i.e., display one large speed command versus several smaller ones). By giving fewer\\nIM speeds, the deviation from the expected speed profile can be greater so NASA provides the\\nfast / slow indicator to help the flight crew follow the expected profile. The fast / slow indicator\\nshows the flight crew whether the aircraft is on the expected speed profile, which is otherwise\\nunknown to the flight crew. The flight crew is expected to set the IM speed in the MCP but is\\nalso expected to use the fast / slow indicator to manage pitch / drag to decelerate (for\\nexample) to match the profile (and to avoid poor performance when off-profile). Based on the\\ndesign, there could be a situation where an IM speed is given that the flight crew quickly\\ndecelerates to, which takes them off the expected profile. In this situation, the IAS / MCP speed\\nwould match the IM speed but the fast / slow indicator would show the aircraft slow (because\\nthe aircraft has decelerated too quickly relative to the assumed profile). 2-38 Figure 2-24. AGD with IM Features from Kibler et al. (2015) [Reprinted from Kibler et al.,\\n2015] Figure 2-25. CDTI Traffic Display with IM Features from Kibler et al. (2015) [Reprinted from\\nKibler et al., 2015] Pilots found the display implementation usable, but there were some concerns with the limited\\namount of information in the forward field of view. Baxley et al. (2014) also noted that pilots\\nexpressed some concerns about the LED indication of a new IM speed not being salient enough. Latorella (2015) examined IM operations with different display combinations and locations (as a\\nwithin subjects variable) and alerting schemes (as a between subjects variable). The display\\ncombinations included: (1) an EFB in an aft location; (2) an EFB in an aft location with an AGD in\\nthe forward field of view; (3) an EFB in a forward location; and (4) an implementation\\nintegrated into existing PFDs and navigation displays. The integrated displays were similar to 2-39 Baxley et al. (2013) except for the addition of a flashing box around new IM speeds and the lack\\nof the conformance box (Figure 2-26). The EFB and AGD implementations are shown in Figure\\n2-27. Fast / slow indications were also provided in a manner similar to previous simulations.\\nEither the EFB or the MCDU were used for set-up. As with previous simulations, the MCDU\\nprovided IM information during the conduct of IM. The alerting triggers included: (1) new IM speeds; (2) deviations from IM speeds; and (3)\\nreminders if the IM speeds were not entered into the MCP. The triggers were alerted either\\nvisually or visually and aurally. The three alerting methods were: (1) all visual only; (2) all visual\\nand aural alerting; and (3) visual only for new IM speeds and reminders with visual and aural\\nalerting for deviations from the IM speed. Figure 2-26. PFD and Navigation Display with IM Features from Latorella (2015) [Reprinted\\nfrom Baxley et al., 2014] 2-40 Figure 2-27. CDTI Traffic Display and AGD with IM Features from Latorella (2015) [Reprinted\\nfrom Baxley et al., 2014] Relevant results here are those related to the alerting. The all visual and aural alerting method\\ngenerally did better than the all visual only alerting, and sometimes better than the visual /\\nvisual and aural combination. There were also results that had interactions between the display\\ncombination and the alerting scheme (as well as Pilot Flying [PF] seat position). However,\\nthough most are less relevant to this work, they are important when considering the display\\nand alert combination. The author recommended additional work to optimize the IM displays\\nand the associated alerting schemes with a strong consideration for the use of visual and aural\\nnotifications. 2-41 Swieringa et al.
