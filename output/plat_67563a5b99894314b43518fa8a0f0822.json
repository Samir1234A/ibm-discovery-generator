  "text": "operational term of the 1980s, were liquidated with the fall of the Soviet Union but that OMGs will obviously be used in some form or another in the future.[footnoteRef:7] Such observations most likely have created a mandate for the Operations Department of the General Staff or professors at the General Staff Academys Department of Operational Art to continue to work on this theory. Now, as opposed to past developments, theorists must take into consideration the impact of a series of technological advancements that not only affect the theorys content but also its reach, which can extend to the heavens (satellites) or under the oceans (cables, submarines, etc.). [6: V. K. Kopytko, The Evolution of Military Art, Military Thought (in English), Volume 1 2008.] [7: M. A. Gareyev, The Living Embodiment of the Brain of the Army, Arsenal Otechestva, No. 2 2012, published 17 June 2013 at http://arsenal-otechestva.ru/article/111-mozg-armii. ] Maneuver, deep operations, and breakthroughs are traits that have long characterized operational arts ground operations. They work in space as well. Satellites maneuver and conduct operations such as extended reconnaissance, inspection, navigation, and other activities. Since operational art planners are not standing still, they may well be working on coordinated and integrated methods to align capabilities with operations in this or in other domains. An operational group, it must be remembered, is a temporary large strategic formation that consists of front forces operating on a separate operational direction or sector of the front,[footnoteRef:8] which in this proposed case would be a space axis. Thus, while the focus is often on Russian maneuver brigades creating an optimal fighting force on the ground, Russian planners may simultaneously be creating an optimal fighting force in space. [8: S. F. Akromeev, main editor, Military Encyclopedic Dictionary, Second Edition, Moscow: Military Publishing House, 1986, p. 513.] Before developing operational art theory, Russian planners look to the future through the prism of trends and forecasting. Operational art theory is then adjusted based on the results of the inquiry to ensure it remains ahead of the present strong technological curve that is driving advances in capabilities. Russias host of new technological achievements in weaponry that President Vladimir Putin touted in March 2018 offer proposed guarantees of strategic stability and parity with other nations for the Kremlin. These new achievements also affect the preparation and planning of operational art for specific new domains, such as space.\\nThis article will attempt to refocus attention on how operational art might be applied to the space domain in Russias planning process. Thinking in such terms opens up other vectors for planners to consider beyond just ground operations. These variants can add input to contested environment operations as well, such as when examining Russias potential operations in the Baltic and Central Europeans areas or even beyond to global operations.\\nA brief discussion of Russias concept of an operation in general and operational art in particular is offered, along with the added concepts of an operational plan and a concept of operations, the components of operational art. That initial discussion of definitions is followed with some limited comments on operational art by the noted Soviet theoreticians Aleksandr A. Svechin and Georgiy Isserson. The views of other prominent Soviet military theorists views on operational art can be found elsewhere.[footnoteRef:9] Svechin and Issersons discussion is followed by more recent discussions on operational art since 1999, which have been few in number. These Russian sources are followed by the work of two US experts, David Glantz and Jacob Kipp, both of whom have written many articles, and even books, on the concept. Their analysis is important, even though truncated here, for it looks at Russian military literature on the topic of operational art from 1914 to more recent times. The article then concludes with a look at Russian satellite and space operations, to include how that nation has tested maneuvering satellites and preparations and plans for operations in space. [9: See, for example, Wilson C. Blythes interesting discussion of other prominent Russian officers views on operational art in World War II and earlier time periods (includes the views of Mikhail Tukhachevsky, N. E. Varfolomeev, Vladimir Triandafillov, etc.) in his work A History of Operational Art, Military Review, November-December 2018, pp. 37-49. The discussion covers US and other nations views on operational art in addition to Russian views.] Definitions of Operational Terms \\nThere are a few examples of what might be termed official definitions of Russian terms, and they can be found in Russias Military Encyclopedic Dictionary and its Military Encyclopedia. There are only a few differences in the two sources used here, the 1986 Military Encyclopedic Dictionary and the eight volumes written between 1995-2003 that compose the most recent Military Encyclopedia. In the latter case only small snapshots of the definition are offered. The point of the comparison of the two sets of definitions is simply to demonstrate consistency, and therefore should be skimmed.\\nOperational art is defined in the Soviet Unions 1986 Military Encyclopedic Dictionary as Encompassing the theory and practice of preparing for and conducting combined-arms, joint, and independent operations (combat actions) by large strategic formations of the armed forces by various branches.[footnoteRef:10] Its tasks include the following: [10: S. F. Akromeev, main editor, Military Encyclopedic Dictionary, Second Edition, Moscow: Military Publishing House, 1986, p. 513.] An investigation of the mechanisms, content, and nature of modern operations and other forms of the operational employment of large strategic formations;\\nAn elaboration of the means of preparing for and conducting operations, the means and methods of organizing and maintaining coordination, the comprehensive support of troops taking part in operations, and the command and control of them; \\nAn elaboration of the operational requirements for organizing and arming large strategic formations;\\nThe development of recommendations for the operational equipping of theaters of military operations;\\nThe study of the views of potential adversaries for the conduct of military actions on an operational-scale.[footnoteRef:11] [11: Ibid.] The term operational art was first used in 1922. The division of military art into strategy, operational art, and tactics did not take place until 1926. During World War II, operational art evolved further in the preparation for and conduct of operations.[footnoteRef:12] In the post-war period, new areas developed in connection with the following: [12: Ibid.] Equipping the Armed Forces with new weaponry and military equipment;\\nIncreasing the combat capabilities of troops;\\nThe increased scale and intensity of warfare and the mutual penetration and interlacing of the various types of operations;\\nAnd the need to conduct principal operations with the joint efforts of the various branches of the Armed Forces.[footnoteRef:13] [13: Ibid., p. 514.] Operational art was defined in 2002 in Russias Military Encyclopedia as Encompassing the theory and practice of preparing for and conducting military operations on an operational scale (operations, battles, combat operations, strikes) by large formations of various branches of the armed forces. Operational art occupies an intermediate position between strategy and tactics[footnoteRef:14] [14: S. B. Ivanov, Main Editor, Military Encyclopedia, Moscow: Military Publishing House, Vol. 6 2002, p. 63. The entire discussion of operational art was on pages 63-67.] An operation was defined in the 1986 Military Encyclopedic Dictionary as \\nAn aggregate of battles, engagements, strikes, and maneuvers, coordinated and interlinked in objective, task, place, and time by various force organizations, conducted simultaneously and sequentially according to a common concept and plan, to accomplish missions in a theater (theaters) of military actions, a strategic or operational direction (in a specific area or zone) within a specified period of time; a form of military action.[footnoteRef:15] [15: Akromeev, pp. 514-515.] Designations include strategic, front, and army, which can be further differentiated as offensive and defensive or initial and subsequent according to time and sequence of execution. Principal indicators include the number of troops taking part, the width of a zone of action, and the depth or rate of advance. Influence on the content of operations is exerted by war aims and the nature of operational missions performed, military-economic capabilities of the state, and the combat capabilities of both sides.[footnoteRef:16] [16: Ibid., p. 515.] An operation was defined in the 2002 Military Encyclopedia as \\nAn aggregate of battles, engagements, strikes, and maneuvers, coordinated and interlinked in objective, task, place, and time by various force organizations, conducted simultaneously and sequentially according to a common concept and plan to accomplish strategic, operational-strategic, operational, or operational-tactical missions in a theater of military operations, a strategic or operational direction, or in a specific vast area (zone) within a specified period of time; a form of military operation.[footnoteRef:17] [17: S. B. Ivanov, Main Editor, Military Encyclopedia, Moscow: Military Publishing House, Vol. 6 2002, p. 77. ] An operational plan was defined in the 1986 Military Encyclopedic Dictionary as \\nthe manner, procedure, order and methods of accomplishing military missions as determined by a commander. It includes the concept of operation (s) (commanders concept), missions of the troops, fundamentals of coordination, support, and the organization of command and control. The operation plan (battle) is the basis of the command and control of troops. It is made as a result of sizing up",
