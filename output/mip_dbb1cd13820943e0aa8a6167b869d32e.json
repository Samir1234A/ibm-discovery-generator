  "text": "advisory and early /\\nlate indicator. The first concept evaluation included the lead aircraft identification in the data\\nblock of the trail aircraft, along with the aircraft role (trail or lead aircraft) and IM state status.\\nControllers reported the lead aircraft identification in the trail aircraft data block as being\\nunnecessary information (this information was also available in an IM clearance window). In the\\nsubsequent concept evaluations, this information was removed but the aircraft role and state\\nstatus information persisted. Controllers did not report issues with IM information replacing the\\nTSAS speed advisories or the early / late indicator for the trail aircraft. 2.5.1.3 IM Clearance Information on ATC Surveillance Displays\\nBesides needing information in the data block about the status of the IM operation, similar or\\ndifferent information may be needed in a window that provides the IM clearance information.\\nPrevious simulations examined this topic only from the center controller perspective and will be\\nreviewed next. The information and format provided to the center controller in the first two simulations in\\nCallantine et al. (2012) is unclear. However, the third simulation provided the IM information in\\nthe meter list. The IM information provided was the ABP, the ASG, the lead aircraft, and the\\nlead aircrafts Intended Flight Path Information (IFPI). Center controllers reported positively on\\nthe overall set of tools available to them, including the meter list. The same information was\\nprovided in the meter list in the simulations as was reported in Callantine et al. (2013) and\\nThipphavong et al., (2013). No display issues were noted. Controllers in Thipphavong et al.,\\n(2013) reported that the meter list was very useful. Baxley et al. (2016) had a similar 2-25 implementation but reported there may have been unintended consequences in their displayed\\nclearance information because they did not have time to incorporate a capability to only show\\nthe controller the relevant IM clearance information for each IM clearance type utilized. This\\nrequired the controller to know which information was required for which operation and to\\nonly issue the necessary information. They suggested fixing this for future implementations.\\nHowever, controllers generally reported favorably on the display implementation. Benson et al. (2011) reported a simulation with center controllers that evaluated two different\\ndisplay implementations (i.e., IM window and alert list) for IM clearance information. The IM\\nwindow will be reviewed as it had more favorable objective results, was the preferred\\nimplementation, and is the most relevant implementation. The IM window included four main\\nareas: (1) timeline, (2) a window for the clearance information, (3) a window with IM state and\\nstatus information as well as an area to initiate or terminate IM, (4) a trash can for recently\\nterminated IM operations. The FIM List timeline showed when an IM clearance would be\\navailable (Figure 2-13). The FIM information window showed the lead and trail aircraft\\nidentifications, ASG, lead aircraft sector, and predicted spacing at the ABP. It used color coding\\nto differentiate between the IM pending (clearance issued but not yet accepted by the flight\\ncrew) and active states. The rest of the clearance (the ASG) was in the command info window\\nwhich is where the clearance was presented. 2-26 Figure 2-13. MITRE IM Window Controller Information [Reprinted from Benson et al., 2011] The timeline received favorable feedback. For the information in the window with IM state and\\nstatus, the controllers reported that the predicted interval at the ABP was useful but were split\\non whether it was a requirement and just over half thought it was useful as an indicator of\\n[IM] status. Controllers did not report the sector information for the lead aircraft to be very\\nuseful. In a follow-on simulation, Peterson et al. (2012) used the existing TBFM metering list (which\\nincluded the Meet Time Error [MTE]) to add IM information. The only IM information that was\\nadded was IM status state, the ASG, and an indication of the ability of an aircraft to act as a lead\\nfor an IM operation. The trail aircraft was already listed as the first element in the TMA\\nmetering list and the lead aircraft was inferred to be the aircraft directly ahead in the schedule.\\nThe controller was not able to interact with the list. All interactions were via the data block. The\\ncurrently available MTE parameter was provided to the controllers as the spacing compliance\\ntool. Controllers reported having this information was useful. However, only a slight majority of\\ncontrollers reported that the MTE was useful for maintaining awareness of IM operations. More 2-27 downstream controllers found it useful than did upstream controllers. Controllers reported that\\nthe IM status state, the ASG, and the lead aircraft indication were useful. 2.5.1.4 ATC Research Needs\\nAs can be seen from past work, general acceptance of IM operations has been reported in\\nnumerous simulations, including some examining IM during metering (e.g., Rognin et al., 2005;\\nPenhallegon and Bone, 2008; Benson et al., 2011; Callantine et al., 2012; Baxley et al., 2016).\\nHowever, there are still issues that need to be addressed related to the interaction between\\nTSAS (absolute spacing) and IM (relative spacing), as well as controller information needs in the\\nTRACON. The interactions between these two types of spacing behaviors is important to\\nunderstand since both are expected to be fielded by the FAA to maximize capacity. As discussed in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, IM and TSAS operations achieve operational spacing goals\\nin different ways. During IM / relative spacing, the IM aircraft performs spacing adjustments\\nrelative to a lead aircraft. In absolute spacing, spacing adjustments are made with respect to\\ncrossing a specific location at a designated time, independent of the lead aircraft (once the\\nschedule is frozen). The following issues have been identified in past IM and metering activities. Controllers can have difficulty visualizing time-based spacing (as compared to distance-\\nbased operations) (e.g., Aligne et al., 2003) Under certain conditions, separation can be an issue because the IM algorithm is only\\nconsidering spacing at a point (the ABP) and not separation along the way. Baxley et al.\\n(2016) recommended examining placing the ABP at the location where the aircraft routes\\nmerge to ensure separation at that point. Controllers that participated in the concept\\nevaluation activities also expressed concern about this potential issue. IM aircraft can be outside of the slot markers. While slot markers were found useful in\\ngeneral, in some instances, they were reported as less so for IM aircraft. Proposals to\\nmodify slot makers have been mentioned (e.g., Cabrall et al., 2012) but not reported or\\ntested. Necessary IM information and where it should be displayed to support the controller in\\nIM operations is still an open topic. For example, it remains unclear what information\\ncontrollers require to monitor the progress of the IM operation and to determine\\nacceptable spacing for the handoff and final spacing at the ABP. Splitting the information\\nbetween a clearance window and the data block also still needs examination. While past simulations did not report issues with TRACON controllers receiving aircraft\\nalready conducting IM from the en route environment, concept evaluation activities leading\\nup to this simulation did have some questions from controllers about the acceptability of\\nthis. Therefore, the topic should be explored further to see if HITL participants have any\\nconcerns. This simulation will attempt to address these open issues and continue validation of other\\ntopics from past efforts. 2-28 2.5.2 Flight Deck Topics 2.5.2.1 Flight Deck Display Spacing Information\\nDisplays for IM must include the necessary information to perform IM and must not contain\\ninformation that conflicts with IM tasks. Any annunciations must also be salient. In order for\\npilots to trust the IM system, they must be able to develop an appropriate mental model (i.e.,\\nabstract functional understanding) of the operation and to fully understand the objectives and\\nmethods IM uses to achieve and maintain spacing. For example, they will need to understand\\nthat the spacing to be achieved is based on a time interval, and that distance spacing will be\\nvariable due to winds and compression. The degree to which their mental models conform to\\nthe reality of the IM operations will allow them to appropriately calibrate their level of trust. A\\ngood mental model is also important for situation awareness in that it provides a mechanism\\nfor integrating and comprehending information and allows for projecting future states (Endsley,\\n1995). Over the course of HITL research on IM2, there has been shown to be general acceptability of\\nIM and the ability to meet the spacing goals (e.g., Hebraud, Hoffman, Pene et al., 2004;\\nSwieringa et al., 2014; Penhallegon, Mendolia, Bone, Orrell, and Stassen, 2011). However, a\\ndominant, re-occurring issue is flight crew understanding and trust in the IM algorithms\\nbehavior and the related ability to monitor the progress of the spacing task. Past simulations\\nhave attempted to support the flight crews and through examination of different display\\nfeatures. The past work has shown that certain features can lead to confusion, additional\\nworkload and head-down time, or simply may not be utilized. The past work also shows that an\\nideal, or even reasonable, implementation has been challenging to achieve. The remainder of\\nthis section will review this past work. 2.5.2.1.1 EUROCONTROL Research\\nThe first IM simulations conducted by EUROCONTROL included a limited number of pilots, and\\nonly a basic Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI) capability (Zeghal, Hoffman, Cloerec,\\nGrimaud, and Nicolaon, 1999). Only qualitative feedback was received as the main effort was to\\ndetermine the feasibility of IM. Results revealed some issues that the authors speculated were\\ndue to the rudimentary CDTI (e.g., no IM speeds). The second set",
