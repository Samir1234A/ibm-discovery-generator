  "sdl_extracted_summary": "before progressing to more challenging \\nimplementations. For example, initial implementations that limit allowable wake category \\npairings and operate to higher approach weather minima could be considered in advance of a \\nPA-specific separation standard being finalized (Bateman, et al., 2017). IM PA separation and \\nimplementation may not be fully understood until after the completion of a full safety process, \\nseparation standard design, and determination of facility-specific adaption parameters. IM PA Setup3.2.4\\nThe IM PA procedure is contained within the terminal area and can only be executed once both \\naircraft are established on their final approach courses. IM PA would function equally well \\nwithin metered and non-metered flows. The two domains differ mainly in the way aircraft are \\ndelivered to the approach and their initial spacing controlled to ensure success. These \\ndifferences are shown in Table 2-1. Table 2-1.

Or, when available, IM PA can be set up by another IM operation \\nthat is initiated en route. This other IM operation delivers the IM PA pair to their final approach \\nsegments in position to transition to an IM PA procedure. A scenario that illustrates both cases \\nis summarized in Penhallegon & Stassen (2018). ix\\n 5 Several of the figures in this section are adapted from Mendolia, et al. (2016). When metering is not available, controllers must manually set up a tactical IM PA operation, \\npossibly with the support of unique IM PA tools. this involves the identification of aircraft pairs, \\nAssigned Spacing Goals, and establishing the aircraft on their final approaches with the \\nappropriate initial spacing as described in Stassen, et al. (2013) and FAA (2017b). ATC HITL \\nresearch involving controllers from Northern California TRACON (NCT) suggests this is feasible \\n(Domino, Tuomey, Stassen, & Mundra, 2014), though somewhat challenging if a 15 NM or \\nlonger final is an absolute minimum requirement (Mendolia, et al., 2016). General setup conditions and procedures for either the metering or non-metering (tactical) case \\nare not further described in this paper as they are not directly relevant to the findings. \\nHowever, potential concepts for setting up IM PA for SFO arrival operations are described in \\nSection 2.3.3. Planned Final Approach Speed3.2.5\\nIn any arrival and approach operation, it is important to understand the speed profile of \\nsuccessive arrivals late in the approach to maximize buffer reduction. As described in Stassen, \\nPriess, & Weitz (2016), factors such as final approach speed have a bearing on the evolution of \\nthe spacing interval late in the approach. Because of this, the PA concept has traditionally \\nassumed the need for Planned Final Approach Speed (PFAS) as input to the spacing goal \\ncalculation Stassen, et al. (2013). One implication is that if the relative difference in PFAS \\nbetween the IM Trail Aircraft and IM Lead Aircraft changes beyond a certain threshold, the \\nAssigned Spacing Goal may need to be recalculated and sent to the IM Trail Aircraft. It is not \\nknown if it will be necessary to consider changes in PFAS in real time once the aircraft have \\nbeen cleared for their approaches. It may ultimately be decided to allow the aircraft to be \\nbroken out only if it appears that either the CSL and WSL will be exceeded. The requirements for providing PFAS and managing revisions are still being determined. Due to \\nthe lack of definition around the alternatives and trade space, the research scope for this study \\ndid not include an examination of the human factors issues associated with relative PFAS \\nchanges and Assigned Spacing Goal updates. Application of IM PA to NCT and SFO Operations3.3\\nImplementation of the IM PA procedure is highly dependent on the facility and operational \\nenvironment. As this HITL simulation examined an IM PA operation at NCT/SFO, this section \\nprovides an overview of the relevant airspace, then summarizes how IM PA operations could \\npossibly be incorporated into NCT and SFO arrival operations in both metering and non-\\nmetering environments. NCT/SFO Airspace Overview3.3.1\\nAs shown in Figure 2-55, NCT manages three main flows into SFO airspace, worked by a variety \\nof positions. The DYAMD flow is worked by the Cedar High Feeder, Niles Low Feeder and Foster \\nFinal. The SERFR flow is worked by the Laguna High Feeder, Boulder Low Feeder and Woodside \\nFinal, and the BDEGA flow is worked by the Boulder Low Feeder and Woodside Low Final \\n(landing Runway 28L) or Foster Final (landing Runway 28R). The approximate balance of traffic x\\n on these three routes is 50 percent on DYAMD, 25 percent on SERFR, and 25 percent on BDEGA. A \\nsmall number of satellite airport operations (Oakland, San Carlos, San Jose) and tailored oceanic \\narrivals (PIRAT) occur in the airspace. In addition, vectoring airspace floors are established to \\naccommodate Moffet Federal Airfield operations. Figure 2-5. SFO Traffic Flows and ATC Positions The SFO arrival and departure sectors are depicted in Figure 2-6. Four arrival positions normally \\nmanage the inbound flows to SFO. The low altitude arrival positions are NILES and BOULDER \\nand the high-altitude positions are CEDAR and LAGUNA. All breakouts are handed off to the \\ndeparture sector SUTRO. xi\\n Figure 2-6. NCT/SFO Arrival and Departure Sectors The two Final Approach sectors, FOSTER and WOODSIDE, are shown in Figure 2-7. Figure 2-7. NCT/SFO Final Approach Sectors IM PA Monitoring at NCT/SFO3.3.2\\nRequirements for separation monitoring and controller roles and responsibilities for IM PA at \\nNCT and SFO must be generally compatible with the facilitys arrival operation and equipment \\ncapabilities. Due to its dual intersecting runway configuration shown in Figure 2-8, SFO currently \\nemploys a single Local controller (plus a radar assist) to manage arrivals and departures on the \\n28 Left (L)/28R runways and 1L/1R runways. During SOIA operations, FAA Order 7110.65X \\nrequires separate monitor controllers, each with transmit / receive and override capability for \\ntheir assigned runway on the local control frequency (FAA, 2017a). In the case of SFO and NCT, a \\nwaiver was granted to allow the monitoring of SOIA arrivals at NCT on Woodsides and Fosters \\nfrequencies which eliminates the possibility of the monitors blocking critical transmissions on \\nSFO Local frequency. This is possible at SFO because SOIA procedures allow for separate \\nleft/right (L/R) Final Approach controllers to work the finals until the aircraft are 3.3 mile from \\nthe runway. Only then are they handed off to the Local controller. The trailing aircraft then \\nnavigates visually for the last portion of the approach. At this point, the aircraft no longer \\nrequire monitoring and are transferred to the single Local controller. xii\\n Figure 2-8. SFO Airport Map IM PA is intended for operations in IMC and does not require the use of visual separation during \\nthe final portion of the approach. Implementing separate L/R Monitor controllers, as would be \\nrequired by current 7110.65X rules, may not be practical or feasible at SFO since that would also \\nrequire separate Local controllers and frequencies, one for each arrival runway. This could \\nintroduce significant coordination challenges managing the airports four runway intersections \\nand runway crossings for arrival aircraft. However, past research results suggest that similar to \\nSOIA, dedicated Monitor controllers would be the preferred implementation at NCT/SFO to \\nprovide IM PA separation (Mendolia, et al., 2016). Due to the challenges this would introduce at \\nfacilities such as SFO, the feasibility and acceptability for a single monitor controller to provide \\nIM PA separation needed to be examined. Lateral Deviations3.3.2.1\\nThe SFO monitor display consists of a PRM display with 4:1 lateral expansion and 1 second \\nupdate, an NTZ region that aircraft are not allowed to penetrate, and NTZ alerting that indicates \\nif one does penetrate or is predicated to penetrate the NTZ located between the two runways. \\nThe NTZ for SOIA requires straight-in approaches until the visual segment (FAA, 2017a). The \\nSOIA monitoring task requires that controllers take action if an aircraft enters the NTZ region. At \\nSFO the NTZ consists of a rectangle that is 2000 ft wide, beginning at the point where vertical xiii\\n 6 The offset is also required to overcome navigation overlap and to enable the design of the IM PA safety limits. separation would be lost, and ending approximately 3.3 NM from the runways. At that point the \\ndistance between the respective approach courses is the required 3000 ft, which provides a 500 \\nft buffer to the end of the NTZ. After this point, monitoring ends as the aircraft transition to \\nvisual separation approximately 3.3 NM from the runway for the Lead and 3.4 NM from the \\nrunway for the Trail. An IM PA RNAV",

Public Release Case Number 18-2212 Online Web Access and Data Base Tool Options \\nThe team working at MITRE used Sharepoint as an initial prototyping tool for this study because it is being widely used for this type of purpose at MITRE and other commercial Corporations and it is already on the Navys NMCI enterprise environment and available to every user at NAVSEA. Other options for implementing this type of data base functionality are platforms like Infusion/Confluence/Jira or MySQL or Web Logic. These tools are being investigated. There are several factors that are involved in creating data base tools for an enterprise, primarily functionality, size and scalability, simultaneous access, and security. For the immediate near term use the Microsoft Sharepoint platform provides the required functionality (data type enforcement on entry, logic testing when creating views, access to the Navys Outlook email directory services and automated email). Whether the software needs to support a large number of projects (e.g. several PEOs) or a small number (e.g. only pilot program use) is an important consideration. For eventual enterprise level use, Sharepoint may have size limitations however, as the file is essentially a large flat-file structure. Creating subfolders for each PEO would solve the size limitation, while still allowing the creation of integrated reports at the enterprise level. Connectivity to a SQL data base would also solve the size limitation issues, and allow improved security and replication (data durability). The Confluence/Jira tools may require more extensive operator efforts to create this type of online repository, and are designed to create online documents, not collect data online. Sharepoint Lists are designed to collect data online, but in small quantities. These types of environments have both had reported security issues when the data bases were not locked down properly. For some of the acquisition documents, such as the Acquisition Plan, we leveraged a standard template and appendix, and focused on adapting the appendix into a data base. In the future it may also be possible to leverage this approach for other documents, providing greater efficiency. Other documents, such as the TEMP and LCSP, were already more data focused and were easily adapted. The draft schema provided in this report can evolve through testing in the pilot program.

Public Release Case Number 18-2212 An Expert Assistant for Project Planning and Reviews \\nThe shift towards data driven project management tools should also allow project managers the ability to do improved project planning. This can be done three ways: a) The project initiation tool can provide helpful guidance in the instruction on how to structure certain milestones, based on the new structures being put into place to support the data-based acquisition process. b) The project initiation tool can provide an ongoing running average of schedule durations for certain steps, such as data-based project AP approvals, so that a project engineer or manager can see how long certain actions are currently taking and allow a similar time span. (the executive oversight steering Team will also have access to these metrics to monitor progress, set goals, and attempt corrective actions to speed schedule activity). This would require that the planning tool be designed to allow a split screen viewing that allowed the input of new data on the left side of the screen, and display of similar to columns for other projects on the right side of the screen. c) Once several projects have started and are being executed, the project initiation tool could allow project engineers and managers to select projects from the data base that are similar to their project, and see how long actions are taking. This might work a lot like the comparison shopping tool on Amazon.com where you can compare the features of several items before deciding on a purchase. The tool could also ask several questions about the project or observe the parameters that are input first, then provide recommendations as to planning actions and schedules based on the data base of previous project. This also suggests that Program Executives and Program Managers could take advantage of such an expert when they are reviewing projects, either during review meetings or in a background manner. The tool could allow them to compare the project to others in a similar manner as the planning module, and compare execution schedules and success. The data base could also be set up to provide email alerts when an ongoing project and an execution parameter passes a certain threshold or misses a critical milestone in a manner that predicts future problems. Such an expert system will help prevent projects from starting out with poorly planned schedules. Many projects miss schedules or have execution issues because their schedule was designed by matching an almost randomly generated budget profile, dictated by a political decision, generated by a contractors marketing presentation, or guessed by a project team struggling to finish a myriad of other tasks and without any sort of data for comparison. The expert system can also provide useful inputs to new teams that are used to the old schedules that took forever, providing useful suggestions and recommended event metrics based on the new approaches being used.

Public Release Case Number 18-2212 Summary / Recommendations \\nAs part of an improved defense business model, Acquisition Strategies, Acquisition Plans, Test and Evaluation Master Plans, Life Cycle Sustainment Plans, Cyber Security Strategy Plans, and the Acquisition Planning Baseline and Decision Memorandum can all be converted to use a data- based management approach. This will allow automated routing of the projects data for approvals, and also captures project data in its elemental form, thus allowing the application of data analytics to support strategic reviews by NAVSEA management. This approach can also be expanded relatively easily to allow data to be captured and re-used for the Requests for Proposals (e.g. product names, reference specifications or drawing numbers, quantities required, period of performance, etc). This approach may not always work for every procurement or major platforms, but could allow rapid actions for a large number of projects. The draft schema provided in this report can evolve through testing in the pilot program. Shifting to a data-based approach to procurement planning and project management at NAVSEA should allow data-based projects to move faster and provide project and management data to senior leadership that will allow metric based decisions and pilot tools that could be used in a larger number of Navy programs. MITRE Recommends that the project data base functionality be tested on several platforms (e.g. Sharepoint and Confluence/Jira), if possible, and assessed for usability and functionality. The technical features of the hosting environments can be assessed and measured or rated, and then a final decision can be",
