One of its core capabilities is mapping the effect-impact relationship between the cyber and \\noperational domains within a simulation environment. With this technology we aim to \\naddress the problem of understanding precisely how effects in one domain could propagate \\nto the other and manifest into certain impact in a complex simulation environment. STEP \\ncould bring benefits to a broad range of sponsors, both military and civilian, who are \\nentrusted with mission-critical responsibilities through analyzing simulation data. We also \\nidentify three technical hurdles that could affect sponsor acceptance of STEP and lay out a \\ntransition path to the relevant sponsors. Executive Summary\\nWe introduce the Simulation Training Exercise Platform (STEP), a technology developed by the Carnegie Mellon Universitys (CMU) Software Engineering Institute (SEI). As a cyber \\nsimulator that can be interfaced with a mature operational simulator, one of its core \\ncapabilities is to trace the effect-impact relationship between the cyber and operational \\ndomains in the simulation environment. STEP has gained traction within the DOD, where it \\nis being applied in several DOD-sponsored cyber exercises. A long-standing problem in the Modeling & Simulation (M&S) community is the lack of \\nability to trace and study how effects from one domain would propagate to result in an \\nimpact in the other domain. Failure to do so makes it difficult to diagnose the root cause of \\nan adverse impact in the simulation space. In addition, DOD simulations have not kept up \\nwith the current reality of more blended missions on the battlefield, which could leave \\ndecision makers ill-prepared for real-life crises. Sponsors, such as the Army Research Lab (ARL) and the Federal Aviation \\nAdministration (FAA), have expressed strong interest in adopting STEP in their respective \\nsimulation environments. However, there are some technical hurdles that need to be \\naddressed before STEP could find acceptance among a diverse group of sponsors. These \\ninclude properly evaluating the effectiveness, versatility, and scalability of STEP. The applicability of STEP to the Army and FAA sponsors requires a well-defined \\ntransition path based on studying their respective operational simulators and \\ncontextualizing STEP within these two domains. v Table of Contents Abstract \\nExecutive Summary \\nTable of Contents \\nList of Figures \\n1.

Cross-domain interactions in the simulation space \\nIn a simulation environment comprising a cyber domain and an operational domain, the progression of a simulation run is driven by the myriad interactions between the domains. Such \\ninteractions are typically initiated by some effect in one domain, which then propagates to the \\nother domain and results in an impact in the target domain, as observed by the simulation \\noperator governing the simulation. The Simulation Training Exercise Platform (STEP) is a cyber simulator that provides training \\nin various cybersecurity fields, such as Information Assurance (IA), incident response, and \\ncomputer forensics. First developed at Carnegie Mellon Universitys (CMU) Software \\nEngineering Institute (SEI) in 2003, STEP has undergone periodic and incremental upgrades. \\nOver the last 15 years of evolutionary development, it has now reached a high level of maturity \\nand stability. One of the key features of STEP is its ability to accurately map out the cross-\\ndomain effect-impact relationship; this is achieved through an SEI-defined Application Program \\nInterface (API) called Cyber-Kinetic Effects Integration (CKEI) [2]. STEP traces the inter-domain effect-impact relationship by re-creating the domain space \\nwhere the impact would be manifested. Figure 1 illustrates this approach, using STEP interfaced \\nwith the Army OneSAF simulator as an example. In the operational simulation domain where \\nOneSAF operates, on identifying a target, the Forward Observer (FIS) sends a report to the \\nBattalion (BN), which then relays the information to the Brigade (BDE). BDE issues the Call For \\nFires (CFF) order, sends it to BN, which forwards this message to the Battery. The Battery then \\nassigns the actual firing to the particular Gun, which executes the CFF order to fire on the \\ntarget. Figure 1. Illustration of how STEP realizes CKEI between the cyber and operational domains. In the cyber domain, STEP creates a virtual copy of each physical device, as well as the ii networking that connects these devices, that participates in the CFF order propagation \\nthroughout the echelon. The states of these virtual nodes at any given time closely mirror those \\nof their counterparts in the operational domain. Each physical node that receives the CFF \\nmessage routes it to the next intended recipient via its virtual counterpart, which then forwards \\nit to the virtual counterpart of the intended recipient, who then passes it to the recipient in the \\noperational domain. If the nodes in the operational domain (OneSAF) are compromised on the \\ncyber side, the virtual nodes in STEP update their state and any associated communications \\nmessage accordingly. Current State-of-the-Art2.\\nAt the present, STEP is primarily being tested by the DOD, specifically the Army. SEI continues to expand its capability set with new features and enhancements to support ever-\\nincreasingly complex simulation scenarios. Pairing STEP with Operational Simulators2.1\\nAccording to SEI, there are currently two methods of pairing STEP with a mature operational simulator. In the first method, SEI provides an external interface to link STEP with the \\noperational simulator at the customers site. When a simulation scenario is set up, the customer \\nworks closely with SEI to define the detailed requirements on the effects to be introduced into \\nthe cyber domain. SEI is then responsible for configuring STEP and implementing these effects. \\nThis work is transparent to the customer, who continues to focus on setting up the operational \\ndomain for the scenario. The Army is currently testing STEP with two of its simulators, OneSAF \\nand VBS3, via this external-interfacing approach. In the second method, the customer receives a copy of the STEP software from SEI and \\ninstalls it at their site. The customer is responsible for configuring the STEP and interfacing it \\nwith its operational simulator. To help them do this, the STEP package includes a suite of \\ntutorial videos that train operators how to set up and configure the desired effects. STEP has \\nbeen used in several DOD-organized exercises such as Cyber Flag and Cyber Guard. Both methods have been tested in DOD-sponsored exercises. Latest STEP Enhancements2.2\\nThrough periodic cycles of development, SEI is constantly expanding STEPs feature set to support cyber training in more complex and diverse simulation environments. The aim is to \\nmake STEP more agile and modular. Some of the most recent enhancements added to STEP \\nfollow. These features are all optional and their absence from STEP does not affect our study of \\neffect-impact relationship mapping. TopoMojo: The current STEP contains a rich set of features that may not all be \\napplicable to a particular customers needs. The set could also create the problem of \\ninflexibility in installation and deployment. In response, TopoMojo was developed as the \\nlightweight version of STEP. It retains the key features of STEP, such as CKEI, while \\nremoving others. iii WELLE-D: This is a tool that simulates wireless communications. It can be used to model \\nOpen Systems Interconnect (OSI) Layer-2 (MAC-layer) wireless links. \\nSCADASIM: This feature allows the cyber operator to manipulate SCADA systems \\n(power, lighting, security cameras, etc.) during a simulation run. It contains several \\ncomponents, such as Human-Machine Interface (HMI) and a Historian that archives the \\nlog files. \\nGHOSTS: This application tracks the real-time status (e.g., health check) of all server \\nactivities during a simulation run. It uses a PostgreSQL database to archive all data \\npertaining to activities in the simulation space. Data visualization is achieved through the \\nuse of a GUI, which includes a number of more commonly used performance metrics. \\nThe user can also write his/her own PostgreSQL script to extract relevant data from the \\ndatabase for more in-depth analysis. \\nGreyBox: This is a tool that runs on a Virtual Machine (VM) to model the entire Internet (\\nInternet in a box). One use case of GreyBox is to study a Local Area Network (LAN) in \\nthe context of global Internet. The LAN can be seen as one entity, and the rest of the \\nInternet another entity; the two are connected via a gateway. \\nCartographer: This feature is used to validate the network deployed prior to simulation \\ncommencement. It is intended to minimize human mistakes when manually entering \\nhundreds of IP addresses for a large simulation scenario. Once launched, Cartographer \\ncan identify errors in the",
