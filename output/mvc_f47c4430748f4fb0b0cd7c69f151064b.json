Next, we associate the adversary \\ngoals with respect to the stages of the cyber attack lifecycle against these systems and system \\nenvironments keeping in mind that the adversarys end goal is to impact the mission. We \\nidentify which cyber resiliency techniques and which approaches to implementing or applying \\nthose techniques might be effective in preventing the adversary from achieving this goal. \\nSystems security engineers can use the analysis presented in this report as a starting point for \\nprogram-specific refinement, enabling development and execution of a Program Protection Plans \\n(PPP) that addresses cyber supply chain risks effectively. Program-specific refinement of the \\ngeneral analysis presented in this report needs to take into consideration such programmatic \\nconstraints as reliance on legacy components, components of uncertain provenance, or shared \\nservices. SSEs supporting a Program Office will be able to evaluate how well the Program Office \\n(and its ICT support), the Prime or Integration Contractor, and other organizations (e.g., the \\nMaintenance Contractor if different from the Prime, IV&V, cyber range) are applying cyber \\nresiliency throughout the acquisition lifecycle to reduce supply chain risks due to cyber attacks.\\nTo apply these recommendations, Programs will need to include requirements motivated by \\ncyber resiliency into contractual documents, specifically SOWs and FRDs. SOW requirements \\nwill lead to contractors (the Prime or Integration Contractor, the Maintenance Contractor if \\ndifferent, and subcontractors as appropriate) applying selected cyber resiliency techniques in the \\ndesign, production, test, and maintenance environments, to make the supply chain more cyber \\nresilient. FRD requirements will make acquired mission systems more resilient against cyber \\nattacks that exploit weaknesses in the supply chain. \\nNext steps could include development of detailed notional worked examples, with sample \\ncontractual language; extending the analysis beyond the focus on ICT to include weapons \\nsystems or platform IT (PIT); and application to a specific mission system. xlii i ReferencesAppendix A\\n[1] D.

Analysis of Known Supply Chain Attacks Appendix B In August, 2014, the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems \\nEngineering (DASD-SE) described 41 known supply chain attacks [3]. Subsequently, the \\nCommon Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification [22] was updated to include these 41 \\nattacks. In the DASD-SE paper, each attack is characterized by: Target (hardware, software, firmware or system information)\\nDescription\\nVector (path followed by attacker)\\nOrigin (e.g., insider, outsider)\\nGoal (Disruption, Corruption, Disclosure, Destruction) \\nImpact\\nReferences\\nThreat\\nVulnerabilities exploited\\nAttack Points within the Supply Chain\\nApplicable Acquisition Life Cycle Phases It is important to note that the target for these 41 supply chain attacks are predominetly ICT \\ncomponents. An attack within the DASD-SE paper is the successful insertion, modification or \\nsubstitution13 to/of a component within the supply chain (regardless of whether or not it makes it \\ninto an operational system.) In this paper, the DASD-SE attacks are referred to as attack \\nsteps that are taken to complete a full cyber-attack on the end mission or system, using the \\nCyber Attack life-cycle. These steps (or actions) are mapped to the stages in the cyber attack \\nlifecycle described in Section 2.4, using the following definitions and rationale: Reconnaissance the adversary develops a target; Example: Gathering information \\nabout components used in the end mission system\\nWeaponize the attack is put in a form to be executed on the victim's \\ncomputer/network;Example: An piece of software is modified during the development \\nstage\\nDeliverthe vulnerability is delivered to the target; Example: the modified software is \\noffered and accepted as a patch\\nExploit the initial attack on target is executed;Example: The modified software is on \\nthe end system and ready to execute\\nControlmechanisms are employed to manage the initial victims; Example: The \\nadversary has a way into receive and manage the results from the successful exploit\\nExecute leveraging numerous techniques, the adversary executes the plan; and \\nMaintain long-term access is achieved. To better understand the adversarys objectives in using the supply chain to exploit a targeted \\nnetwork and end mission system, we have analyzed the 41 defined supply chain attacks steps \\n[19] by grouping them by methods used: Insertion, Substitution, or Modification. These methods ii are used by an adversary to achieve their goals working across the acquisition life cycle with the \\nfocus on impacting an end mission system in the Operations and Support phase. \\nThese attack method types are defined as follows: Insertion: Adding additional information, code, or functionality to an ICT module or \\ncomponent which performs a new, malicious function or otherwise subverts the intended \\nsystem functions. For example, adding malicious code to a software library. Most attacks \\nof this",
