  "text": "IP address space in a matter of minutes. This tool can be used \\nto check for errors from OSI Layer 3 (IP) up to OSI Layer 7 (Application). Applicability to Sponsors3.\\nDue to the high volume and complexity of cross-domain interactions, mapping a relationship between the effect in one domain and its impact in the other is a daunting challenge (Figure 2). \\nFailure to accurately capture this effect-to-impact play makes it difficult to investigate the root \\ncause of an adverse impact. Furthermore, current DOD simulation environments are unable to \\nkeep up with detailed cross-domain interplay on the battlefield, where cyber operators and \\nkinetic operators work alongside each other in increasingly blended missions. The lack of \\nrealism representing blended missions in the simulation space makes the decision makers ill \\nprepared to manage real-life crises. iv \\nFigure 2. Cross-domain interactions in the simulation space. Sponsor Engagement3.1\\nIn this project, we have engaged with three sponsorsthe Army, the FAA, and the Air Forceto gauge their interest in STEP and identify suitable operational simulators for study. The Point-of-Contact (POC) for Army Research Lab (ARL) Survivability Lethality Analysis \\nDirectorate (SLAD), who came across a proof-of-concept demonstration of STEP integrated with \\nthe OneSAF simulator, expressed a desire to pursue further study of this technology. The Aviation Cybersecurity group in support of all FAA simulation activities had been \\nconducting their own investigation of effect-impact interactions. On learning of STEP, they were \\ninterested in a collaborative study to see how its benefits aligned with the sponsor interests. We also exchanged communication with the Computing Infrastructure and IT Service \\nManagement group, which supports Air Force simulations using the AFSIM simulator. Because \\nintegrating STEP with AFSIM would require that STEP be embedded to become part of the \\nAFSIM, this did not fit our original design in which we would maintain two separate domains. \\nConsequently, we decided not to pursue collaboration with them at the present time. Benefits to Sponsors3.2\\nSTEP can bring a host of benefits to various sponsors, both military and civilian. It provides a robust platform to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of new tools and capabilities prior to \\nprocurement. It allows stakeholders to design and execute more realistic simulation \\nexperiments showing how a cyber component would allow or prohibit information exchange \\nbetween operational facilities. Furthermore, it gives simulation operators a means to investigate \\ncyber threats as rigorously as other threats that could negatively impact the mission outcome. For the Army sponsor, STEP could be used to examine, the impacts of cyber effects on the \\ngathered intelligence on the battlefield (whether it is legitimate or compromised) to assist \\ncommanders in making more informed decisions. It could also enhance training to study how \\ncyber effects could maximize operational impact before being applied to real-life missions. v Finally, it would enhance training for cyber operators, reflecting the reality of more blended \\nmissions. For the FAA sponsor, STEP would enhance the effectiveness and realism of cybersecurity \\nexercises for the FAA and its aviation sector partners; this in turn would increase the value of \\nsuch exercises to the stakeholders. It could also improve the effectiveness of air traffic \\noperational incident response during a suspected/confirmed cybersecurity incident. Sponsor Acceptance3.3\\nThe Army was the earliest adopter of STEP in several of its simulation exercises. They have shown a strong interest in continuing study on STEP and making it an integral part of its \\nsimulation environment. The FAA sponsor was recently introduced to the capabilities of STEP. It has expressed \\nwillingness to partner with us and further explore the potential benefits it may bring to the FAA \\nand its aviation-industry partners. The Integration Experimentation and Demonstration for \\nAeronautics (IDEA) lab hosts a sophisticated simulation apparatus that could be interfaced with \\nSTEP. We expect to produce tangible results in the near future to demonstrate its applicability \\nto this sponsor. Furthermore, we plan to invite other sponsors to participate in this study, which would \\nallow us to explore the versatility of STEP. Technical Hurdles4.\\nSTEP promises to bring many benefits. Yet to reach a larger group of sponsors, we need to address the following three considerations that could impede its wider acceptance.\\nFirst, there currently is no systematic approach to evaluating the accuracy of STEP in tracing an effect-to-impact relationship. The high volume and complexity of cross-domain interactions \\nin the simulation space could lead to a certain effect manifesting into unintended impacts, as \\nwell as impacts of higher orders. How to quantify the impact that deviates from the expected \\noutcome, and how to identify higher-order impacts that may be considered negligible, requires \\nfuture study and research. Second, the question remains unanswered as to the versatility of interfacing STEP with a \\nbroad range of operational simulators. STEP was designed to be compatible with any mature \\noperational simulator. To the best of our knowledge, currently STEP has only participated in \\ncyber simulations and exercises with the Army and remains untested by other services and \\nagencies. It would be necessary to collaborate with multiple sponsors and interface STEP with \\ntheir respective simulators to validate its versatility. Third, the scalability of adopting STEP in a simulation scenario should not be ignored. STEP \\nrealizes the CKEI by creating a virtual copy of the domain where the impacts are manifested (as \\nshown in Figure 1). The virtual copy includes each device and networking connection that is \\ninvolved in manifesting the impacts [3]. As the simulation scenario grows in size and complexity, \\nmore computing resources are needed to generate and sustain this virtualization, potentially at \\nthe expense of other aspects of the simulation. A careful examination of the scalability of the \\nuse case with a STEP deployment would help define a more robust scope of the simulation in \\nwhich the capabilities of STEP could be fully and accurately realized. vi Transition Paths5.\\nWe have identified two transition paths to move forward with our STEP study with the Army and FAA sponsors:\\nFor the Army sponsor, interface STEP with OneSAF and develop use cases that \\nexamine the impacts that system-level cyber vulnerabilities may have on warfighting \\nmissions. \\nFor the FAA sponsor, leverage the IDEA lab to develop use cases that demonstrate \\nthe impact of some operational effects on the underlying communications network \\nduring air traffic control operations. Conclusions6.\\nThis report introduced STEP, a cyber-domain training technology developed at the CMU SEI that can trace inter-domain effect-impact relationships within the simulation environment. We \\nevaluated the feasibility of deploying STEP with two operational simulators utilized by two \\nsponsors: ARL and FAA, one military and one civilian. In our findings, STEP could bring benefits \\nto either sponsor by assisting users to make critical decisions based on high-fidelity, simulation-\\nbased analysis. As an initial step, STEP does provide mechanisms to identify and define cross-\\ndomain effects and impacts. However, its potential use in an exhaustive simulation exercise \\nneeds further evaluation. STEPs versatility and accuracy for mapping out the effect-impact \\nrelationship may depend on how it would handle the scalability of the simulation space. Both \\nArmy and FAA sponsors are interested in further collaborative study to evaluate STEP in realistic \\nscenarios.
