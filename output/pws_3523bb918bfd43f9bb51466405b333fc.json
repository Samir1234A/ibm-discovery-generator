  "text": "Category Failure Rate per Flight Hour\\nMicro ( 0.55 lbs.) 1E-2 Mini (0.56 4.4 lbs.) 1E-3\\nLimited (4.5 20.9 lbs.) 1E-4 Bantam (21 55lbs.) 1E-5 Number of pedestrians exposed to aircraft flight operations () density of exposed population is the mean density of people per square o kilometer within the area of operation. The sAAT uses the average population density by square unit area for operations that cover areas with different population densities. Shelter factor ( shelter factor is the proportion of the population density that is exposed to the o vi\\n sUAS operation. A shelter factor of one assumes a worst-case scenario where the population is entirely un-sheltered, conversely, a shelter factor of zero assumes the entirety of the population is sheltered. Probability of the failed aircraft being on a collision course with pedestrian ( is currently defined as where is the calculated horizontal distance from the o point of failure. Probability of the person not avoiding the collision ( currently assumes a unit of one due to the lack of data on what effect onboard o mitigations may provide in avoiding a ground collision with a third-party, or, the \\npossibility of reactions by third-parties to avoid a potential collision threat. The value \\nindicates the worst-case scenario with no effect from onboard mitigations, and no \\nthird-party reaction on the ground. Probability of collision with person resulting in a fatality ( is currently determined by the terminal KE of the aircraft, the impact angle, the o vii\\n velocity equation, and the drag equation. Strengths and Weaknesses of the sAAT 3.2.1\\nStrengths of the sAAT model include: Consistency: Due to sAAT being a quantitative model, a given set of input parameters \\nwill consistently output the same answer providing repeatability.\\nModular Architecture: Given the incipient environment of UAS data, the sAAT is built \\nwith the ability to change input data quickly should research provide an improved input \\nparameter.\\nBuilding on Best Practices: The sAAT incorporates work validated by academia and \\nindustry. Weaknesses of the sAAT model include: Data Requirements Limit Features: sAAT is a relatively inflexible model unless further \\ndevelopment is made to incorporate additional risks such as human error, aircraft \\npenetration rates, effects of weather, impact severity, etc. Limited to Current Data: Being an inflexible model, accuracy of the sAAT is subject to \\naccuracy of the underlying data. Due to a lack of published research; principal data such \\nas aircraft reliability, minimum crash energies resulting in a fatality, and mission profiles \\nare posited until conclusive studies or data are provided or collected. sAAT Ground-Risk Model Inputs3.2.2\\nThe sAAT model allows the user to select standard mission profiles, aircraft characteristics, and \\nselected computational variables, such as the level of energy determined to be fatal, for the risk \\nanalysis calculations. The basic input to the sAAT are the parameters defining the mission area \\nand the aircraft characteristics. The aircraft and mission parameters are captured either in the \\nform of general-purpose mission profiles, or as mission-specific values defined by the user. The \\nrequired aircraft information includes gross-takeoff-weight, cross-sectional area of the aircraft, \\nmaximum aircraft speed, and maximum aircraft operating altitude. Additionally, the user enters \\nthe aircraft type, as either multirotor (e.g. a quadcopter), hybrid, or fixed-wing. Operational \\ninformation includes the expected operating speed and altitude. The sAAT uses global maximum \\nspeed and altitude values if operation specific values are not otherwise specified as an input \\nThe required information for the designated mission area includes the size, shape, geographic \\nlocation, and associated population densities for the region of operation. The region of operation \\nis a set of geodetic latitude and longitude points provided by the user that define either the \\nboundary of operation or the path of operation. Boundaries of operation can be a user defined \\ncircle, rectangle, or non-self-intersecting polygon. Paths of operation are a series of user-defined \\nwaypoints consisting of at least two points.\\nThe density of the population within the route of flight is a significant operational risk factor \\nwithin the mission profiles. Higher population density leads to a proportionally higher \\noperational risk. The sAAT uses a pedestrian density model, which is based on LandScan viii\\n Global Population Database developed by the U.S. Department of Energys Oak Ridge National \\nLaboratory [11]. sAAT Ground-Risk Model Outputs3.2.3\\nThe sAAT defines risk as the probability of fatality to a third-party. A third party is defined as a \\nmember of the public that is not a participant in the sUAS flight activity and is involuntarily \\nexposed to an aircraft accident [12]. It is the bystander that happens to be near the planned area of \\noperation of the sUAS. \\nThe sAAT model interface produces two outputs: (1) a graphical depiction of the risk value; and \\n(2) the sensitivity analysis of risk factors. In combination, these three outputs can aid the analyst \\nin determining if the risk assessment meets the acceptable safety levels. Additionally, the sAAT \\nmodel provides the user with outputs that identify the probability of an impact to a third party, \\nand the probability of the impact being fatal. The sensitivity analysis identifies the variables that \\nhad the most significant impact on driving the level of risk. 3-2. sAAT Input of Kinetic Energy and Probability of Fatality As illustrated in Figure 3-2, the input graph relates the PoF (%) to the estimated impact KE \\n(Joules). The dark line that indicates 50% probability represents the upper threshold of acceptable \\nrisk. In this example, the PoF (risk) is 91.2% for an estimated KE at impact of 165.5 Joules. The \\ngraph indicates, in this notional example, that the computed risk level is above the 50% \\nthreshold.\\nThe model identifies the parameters that have the highest sensitivity in driving the overall level \\nof risk. This allows for the near real-time assessment of risk and helps support the determination \\nof the acceptable risk level of sUAS operations. The sensitivity analysis output, as notionally \\nshown in Figure 3-3, indicates which factors contribute the most to the risk. The risk factors and \\ntheir associated rankings vary depending on the input data of the proposed sUAS operation. \\nFactors are listed in rank order. Positive values on the right side of the y-axis contribute to higher \\nrisk. Negative values, measured towards the left of the y-axis contribute to reducing the risk. In ix\\n this example, the risk can be reduced the most by reducing the greatest contributors: population \\ndensity and the weight of the aircraft. NOTE: this is just a notional output to demonstrate the \\nconcept as shown in Figure 3-2. Flying faster would NOT reduce risk. 3-3. sAAT Output of Sensitivity Analysis sAAT Air-Risk Component3.2.4\\nAlthough sAAT does not currently include an air risk component, it is intended that an air risk \\ncomponent will be added, using the following Modified Endoh methodology [16].\\nThe Air Risk model provides the localized risk analysis based on manned aircraft flight data, \\nwhich is derived from MITREs Global Flight Informatics (MGFI) database of manned traffic \\nunder radar and surveillance coverage. It provides the probability of a Mid-Air Collision Risk, \\nand has been successfully demonstrated with the FAA Pathfinder and UAS Test Site Programs, \\nand the Navys Triton program.\\nAir risk occurs when an operator loses control of the sUAS, and the aircraft achieves unsafe \\nproximity to an aircraft (an encounter). Once an encounter occurs, a calculation is made to \\ndetermine the probability of a near mid-air collision, defined as the situation when the sUAS and \\na manned aircraft occupy the same 3-dimensional space.\\nTypically, the risk calculation will also include a measure of event severity. To calculate the \\nseverity component of an air risk, it is necessary to understand the conditional probability of \\nfatality, given that a collision has occurred. However, research to determine this probability is not \\nyet sufficient to determine the consequences of such a collision.\\nThis methodology uses historical manned aircraft track data to determine a volumetric collision \\nrisk, that is, the probability of collision of an sUAS with a manned aircraft, moving in a volume \\nof airspace defined by time of data, altitude, latitude, and longitude. It does not consider the \\ncharacteristics of the sUAS. Necessary Simplifying Assumptions for sAAT 3.2.5\\nCalculating risk in a quantitative model requires data supporting all the above probabilities. \\nWhen exact probabilities are not available, assumptions must be made about these values, so that \\nthe result may be calculated. x\\n For example, the probability that the operator loses control of the aircraft, , is dependent on many factors, such as model, age, and weather. The sAAT model uses a mean time between failure derived from industry-wide operations as a value to represent the entirety of aircraft \\nreliability [17]. Clearly there is a range of possible probabilities due to the variety of factors, but \\nfor purposes of computational simplicity, sAAT assumes a single point estimate for this \\nparameter.\\nTo speed computation (and development), probabilistic distributions are replaced by point \\nestimates in the current version of sAAT.\\nAlso, some risk components are ignored, as they are not easily quantified: Operator skill\\nWeather conditions during mission\\nVisual obstruction during Line of Sight Operations\\nMechanical mitigations Similar and Related Quantitative Assessments 3.2.6\\nThe basic equation, expressing risk as a function of failure rate, and",
