  "text": "change reduced the average delay that needs to be absorbed at SQUEZ to under 5 \\nseconds, while not affecting the other meter fixes. This change thus allowed for more equitable delay to be absorbed \\nby the various arrival meter fix sectors. American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 18 \\nFigure 12. Scenario Scheduler Output Before (Top) and After (Bottom) \\nWhile this application demonstrated one of the delay distribution analyses the integrated design capability can support, it was not meant to be exhaustive. The analyst together with operational experts are expected to work \\ntogether to determine what changes can be made as well as to determine other aspects of adaptation development \\nincluding operational suitability of the proposed changes. VII. Conclusion \\n A description of the design, development and, potential application of an integrated procedure and arrival management (i.e. TBFM) design tool that has been under development by MITRE CAASD was presented. The \\nresearch focused on identifying and understanding the current processes and tools used in designing and evaluating \\nTBFM and PBN designs, identifying the shortfalls of these current processes and tools, defining requirements for a \\ncapability to help address the identified shortfalls, and prototyping software capabilities based on these requirements. The resulting prototype provides TBFM adaptation visualization and modification, scenario generation, scheduling, \\nand delay-based analysis functions. The prototype capabilities were described and potential applications were American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 19 presented to demonstrate how the developed prototype could be used for PBN and TBFM design and analysis activities \\nas well as how it could help enable the operational integration of TBFM into the NAS. It is envisioned that the research and the resulting capability presented here will enable combined airspace and \\narrival management design and will facilitate more streamlined design and analysis of both airspace and arrival \\nmanagement configuration components. The utilization of these capabilities is expected to contribute to the TBO goal \\nby enabling the creation of airspace designs to enable higher throughput and more efficient flows for terminal and en-\\nroute operations. Continuing research in this area will focus on enhancing this capability to support emerging arrival management \\ncapabilities, such as TSAS, as well as improving the overall user workflow, associated processes, and usability of the \\nproposed integrated design capability.
