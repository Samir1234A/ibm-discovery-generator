  "text": "just the same as liability for damage on Earth by a space object. The change would also facilitate the rules pertaining to the red lines in 1. to become customary international laws, regulations, and enforcement in STM. \\nThe United States should deploy bodyguard spacecraft to get ready in time to protect satellites against the rapidly emerging and growing robotic ASATs. \\nFor fairness, the United States should take the lead to make all spacefaring nations have the same indemnification and other provisions in their third-party liability insurance.[footnoteRef:113] [113: Brian G. Chow, Commercial Space: Space Controls and the Invisible Hand, provided by Henry Sokolski, e-mail on 5 August 2019.\\n] These are all solid recommendations. \\nBefore incentivizing Russia, however, it is mandatory to understand how their space theory differs from ours. That is required for without it, how do we know just what it is the West is trying to incentivize? Another set of recommendations is thus required based on the analysis above. First, the implications of Russias understanding of emerging space trends and the follow-on forecasting of how to use maneuvering satellites and a SODCIT or space OMG should be studied. Russian leaders state that they consider the weakest links in Western systems to be the ones to space systems. How do you incentivize an opponent who believes they have found your weakest link? Further, an understanding of how Russia is developing the proper correlation of forces in space should be developed. If Russia considers space a flank to its more traditional terrestrial focus, then it would also be a place for operational art to unfold and influence events. All of these issues indicate how Russia is preparing to establish superiority in space with equipment to win the IPW and how it is developing its version of the rules of space conflict. Russia will demand equal security in space as they do on the ground. \\nSecond, Western Red Team scenarios depicting Russias space contingent must take these points into consideration. Western discussions should focus on Russias negotiation techniques about space deployments, on the structure they envision to put in place, and on the operational art it plans to implement along with how Russia considers the impact of new trends leading to space conflicts. \\nThird, analysts have to stop shortchanging themselves with mirror-imaging their space priorities with those of Russia. Too few Western analysts apply Russian thought to space, instead relying on their own understanding and noting only that Russia is conducting hybrid warfare against them. While it appears that Russia is seriously considering the use of operational art in space, have Western analysts considered such use? In the exercises available to date in unclassified form, that does not seem to be the case. The West would be wise to deeply consider how Russias military thinks and applies its traditional concepts to the new era, especially how new aspects of military art might be applied in space. \",",
