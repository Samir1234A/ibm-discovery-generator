  "text": "    \"text\": \" Lets Use Technology Transfer to Drive Growth Vicki A. Barbur and Barry A. Costa, The MITRE Corporation The U.S. government invests some $135B each year to advance science and technology (S&T) as the basis \\nfor breakthrough knowledge development and new innovations, of which around 20-30 % is invested in \\nsuccessful technology transfer. This federally-funded research delivers a portfolio of outcomes whose \\nbenefits therefore need to be maximized for growth and economic development. While there are many legitimate cases where the intellectual property (IP) generated as result of such \\nwork should remain with the funded originator, there are also many cases where everyone would benefit \\nif the IP, the product of federal investment, were shared with other parties via the mechanism routinely \\nreferred to as Technology Transfer. This process involves either making the IP freely available as open \\nsource, or entering into a formal licensing agreement with a third party. By pursuing such approaches, the \\nknowledge and/or capability gained through the federal investment can be leveraged by other \\napplications beyond just those that were originally intended. In combination with other new discoveries, \\nit contributes to the pipeline for future generations of innovation. Such a channel is a hallmark of \\nscientific progressand also helps an entrepreneurial ecosystem developthereby growing businesses, \\ncreating new jobs, and boosting the U.S. economy. In practice, however, Technology Transfer typically has not been a high priority within federal research \\nprograms, even though it is often an integral part of legislation and charters that set forth the conditions \\nfor such federal investment. Many federal employees have only a limited understanding of Technology \\nTransfer. Often, it is not required by agency leadership, and there has been no sustained push to ensure \\nthat additional, value-added outcomes are delivered successfully on a consistent basis until now; the \\nintent is that we see some change. In todays global, hyper-competitive innovation marketplace, however, our nation should be maximizing \\nthe impact of every federal dollar spent on research and development. In order to achieve this, we must \\nincrease our emphasis on obtaining full value from these investments. All new government-funded R&D \\ninitiatives should have an outcome-focused philosophy at their core, and federal R&D program managers \\nshould be given additional training to increase their awareness and adoption of Technology Transfer \\nprotocols. Too often today, federal managers are unaware of opportunities to maximize the benefits of the research \\nresults which they manage routinely. Instead, their focus has been on the more traditional aspects of \\ntheir role, such as ensuring that funding and contractual obligations are in order, timelines and budgets \\nare met, and successful innovations transition to the government customer. The end result is that further \\ninnovations that could be spun off to maximize the return on the original investmentbringing new \\nproducts to market and generating significant economic benefitsremain, in effect, locked up and sitting \\non the shelf. Moreover, in many cases, this IP is left legally unprotected, due to the lack of a strategy to \\nsafeguard it. A successful example that illustrates the value of Technology Transfer comes from the Federal Aviation \\nAdministration (FAA and its Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), the Center for \\nAdvanced Aviation System Development (CAASD), operated by The MITRE Corporation). The FAA \\nsponsored CAASDs effort to develop a prototype system that would provide small aircraft with the same \\nlevel of situational awareness in the air that larger planes with costly and sophisticated systems \\nenjoy. CAASD developed the Universal Access Transceiver Beacon Radio (UBR), which affordably Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 16-4693 \\n Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 16-4693 \\n incorporates the communitys standard Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) \\ntechnology. ADS-B, which was developed under the FAAs NextGEN initiative and leverages GPS satellites \\nto feed critical flight data directly to the cockpit, helped address several important operational and safety \\nneeds, both for the FAA and for small aircraft operators. MITRE has since licensed this technology to \\nmore than 20 companies, which now offer a variety of affordable UBRs. Transferring the results of this \\nfederally-funded research has created a new market, revolutionized private aviation, and increased safety \\nin the skies. To secure prolonged growth, we need to make sure that Technology Transfer receives more emphasis \\nand support in the future. Additionally, we need to encourage every government program to consider \\nTechnology Transfer as a natural outcome and an opportunity to drive economic development through \\nincreased manufacturing and new jobs. While there are some success stories similar to that of the UBR, \\nmuch more can be done to generate additional benefits from valuable government investment. Our aim \\nshould be to capitalize on research outcomes much more broadlyboth internally within the federal \\nspace, as well as externally within the private sector. It is clearly of interest to the taxpayer to see that \\nthese major investments benefit a wider community. Barry A. Costa and Vicki A. Barbur Ph.D. are members of the Technology Transfer Office at The MITRE Corporation \",",
