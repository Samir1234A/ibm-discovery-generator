They provide an \\nadvantage for achieving undetectable delivery and early persistence. xx 4 xxi Notional Example of Supply Chain Attack5\\nThis section describes an example of a supply chain attack in the context of the acquisition \\nlifecycle, detailing the steps throughout each acquisition phase and the ultimate impact in the \\nOperations and Support Phase. In this notional example, a wireless local area network is to be \\nacquired and deployed at a campus (e.g., a military base or a set of buildings in a metropolitan \\narea).\\nWe examine a supply chain attack within the context of the Campus Wireless Local Area \\nNetwork (WLAN) Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) Capability Package (CP) [16]. \\nThe intent of this CP is to minimize the risk of wireless devices accessing sensitive data and \\nenterprise service domains. Figure 4 shows an example deployment of the capability that \\nsupports wireless access to multiple classification domains. Figure 4. Multi-level Domain Campus WLAN Solution During the early stages of the acquisition i.e., the Materiel Solutions Analysis and Technology \\nMaturation and Risk Reduction phases, the acquiring organization identifies capabilities and \\nmission system-level requirements, including the requirement for wireless access to multiple \\nclassification domains. The acquisition team identifies several plans for such architectures, \\nincluding the Campus WLAN CP. An adversary would want to engage in this phase primarily for \\nreconnaissance. Initial capabilities and requirements documents (e.g., ICD, CDD) hold valuable \\ninformation such as key performance parameters (KPPs) and key system attributes (KSAs), that \\ncan give adversaries insight into potential designs or likely product choices. For example, the \\nnumber of simultaneous users or VPN performance requirements may limit the number of \\nproduct options. With this information, adversaries can begin to target those specific technology \\nvendors and start researching potential vulnerabilities.\\nIn addition to reconnoitering, adversaries may also have opportunities to influence requirements \\nto degrade the overall security or survivability of the mission system. Adversaries may engage by \\ndirectly accessing and modifying the files or by targeting acquisitions personnel to convince them \\nto make the necessary changes. This might be done by planting information that certain vendors \\nare experiencing product difficulties.\\nDuring the Engineering & Manufacturing Development phase, the technical planning and xxii development gets underway. External personnel are brought in through contracts for capability \\ndevelopment and integration. For the WLAN CP requirements, the acquiring organization starts \\nto specify the architecture and develop the initial hardware and software designs. The \\nAcquisitions Office also begins to identify the appropriate cybersecurity and resiliency needs \\n(Figure 5). Figure 5. Example Campus WLAN Continuous Monitoring Points These activities translate to increased opportunities for an adversary. As the acquisitions shift \\nfrom soft requirements to hard deliverables, the adversary can begin weaponizing and delivering \\nexploits for eventual integration. Adversaries may target the design specifications for specific \\nhardware and software components. They will look for weaknesses in the systems defense and \\nsurvivability capabilities such as flaws in the VPN or wireless frequencies that can be exploited. \\nThey may reverse engineer potential safeguards and verification capabilities. Defensive cyber \\noperations pose an interesting supply chain target for adversaries, as the defenses are usually \\nmonitored less and are not considered mission essential, but are often deployed in line with more \\ncritical components.\\nAdditional external involvement of people and organizations only increases the attack landscape. \\nInstead of targeting the more protected and aware program office, the adversary can focus on the \\nprimary and secondary contractors. The farther the supply chain level is from the acquisition \\norganization (e.g., subcontractors, component suppliers), the more likely an adversary will be \\nable to successfully target as their OPSEC requirements are likely to be less stringent. Instead of \\ngoing after the prime WLAN CP integrator, the adversary may engage or otherwise target the \\nsubcontractor providing the WLAN access points or the supplier of the authentication \\nmanagement software (e.g., as a front company).\\nAs acquisitions shifts into the Production & Deployment and Operations & Sustainment phases, \\nthe adversarial tactics transition to the more typical supply chain attacks against the components. \\nWhile the acquisition activities in Production & Deployment and Operations & Sustainment are \\ndifferent, adversaries will target the supply chain in similar ways to implant and modify \\ncomponents. Production & Deployment is an inject point for counterfeit hardware components, \\nbut similar opportunities present themselves in Operations & Sustainment through testing, \\ntroubleshooting, and periodic upgrade or refresh cycles. A determined adversary will examine the xxiii supply chain to attack the weakest points, regardless of whether it is hardware, firmware, or \\nsoftware.\\nAnother potential supply chain attack vector is through the configuration. Even a small \\nenvironment such as the WLAN CP has multiple configurations to enable authentication and \\naccess management. These include WLAN access lists, VPN configuration and authentication \\nlists, gray management service configurations, firewall rules, IDS/IPS rules, and network \\nappliance and routing rules. Configuration files are rarely modified and less likely to be \\npersistently monitored. Most often, the configurations are brought in from a contractor \\ndevelopment lab via a test facility, or through an external vendor. As it would be evident if an \\nadversary were to tamper with the configuration to degrade the environment, they could use \\nconfigurations to expand the system attack surface by enabling other capabilities or disability \\nsecurity services. Enabling weaker crypto mechanisms on the wireless signals or VPN may be \\njust enough for the adversary to gain access to an otherwise secure WLAN. xxiv xxv 9 Cyber resources are Separately manageable resources in cyberspace, including information in electronic form, as well as \\ninformation systems, systems-of-systems, network infrastructures, shared services, and devices. derived from [9].\\n10 Appendix A provides a brief discussion of the potential effects on the adversary using the cyber resiliency approaches described \\nin this paper. These are discussed in more detail in Table H-6 of [18] and in [33].\\n11 Cyber resiliency objectives are described in [2]. Cyber Resiliency Mitigations for Supply Chain Attacks6\\nThe previous sections described adversary intentions and methods and examined them through \\nthe wireless LAN example. This section recommends cyber resiliency techniques to mitigate \\nadverary attacks on the supply chain. This section introduces cyber resiliency mitigations, defines \\na set of goals for a defender, and then recommends resiliency techniques and approaches that can \\nbest achieve the defenders goals to thwart supply chain attacks throughout all stages of the \\nacquisition lifecycle. The recommended mitigations are listed in the below text. In addition, \\ntables in Appendix D contain a more extensive list of cyber resiliency mitigations and what \\nadversary goals are thwarted and what defender goals are achieved for each.\\nThe SSE combines their knowledge of the specific system under review and the deployment \\nenvironment, with known adversary tactics and techniques. This section can then be used to cross-\\nreference that information with the appropriate cyber resiliency techniques to augment traditional \\nsecurity solutions (e.g., redundancy, privilege restriction, substantiated integrity) and those that \\nadd less traditional cyber resiliency techniques (e.g., diversity, deception, dynamic positioning) \\nthat can change the attack surface [17]. The authorizing official should also consider cyber \\nresiliency in making a risk management judgment and trying to reduce risk to an acceptable \\nlevel. Cyber Resiliency Summary6.1\\nCyber resiliency (also referred to as cyber resilience) can be defined as the ability to anticipate, \\nwithstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on \\ncyber resources.9 Appendix D Summary of Cyber Resiliency Techniques and Approaches \\nsummarizes candidate mitigations for achieving cyber resiliency against supply chain attacks. It is not feasible to apply all cyber resiliency techniques to an architecture, so the system architect \\nis compelled to select the most effective subset of those techniques while considering the impact \\non the overall system. Some considerations when selecting cyber resiliency techniques are: How the technique addresses the types of risks in the architecture under consideration\\nThe relative maturity and readiness for cyber resiliency application\\nThe potential interactions between the techniques both conflicting and synergistic\\nThe effects on the adversary10 \\nAdditional political, operational, economic and technical (POET) factors. It is not possible to adequately incorporate these considerations in an assessment without a \\nspecific architecture and environment. Cyber resiliency techniques are focused on achieving one \\nor more cyber resiliency objectives.11 In addition, some techniques work better in certain types of \\narchitectures than others. For this reason, the discussion here is focused on applicability and will \\nalso discuss the interactions between, the resiliency techniques but will not discuss the specific \\nPOET factors. \\nThe reader should consult Appendix D: Summary of Cyber Resiliency Techniques and \\nApproaches as background information before reading the following sections. It is key to xxvi 12 These acctivities are associated with the effects on threat events described in Appendix H of NIST SP 800-160 [18]. Reducing \\nan attack covers the categories of Redirect, Preclude and Preempt; limiting the effectiveness of attacks covers the categories \\nof Impede and Limit; and gaining and sharing information covers the categories of Detect and Expose. understanding the cyber resiliency techniques and approaches recommended in this section.\\nBecause the following discussion applies to missions in general, Section 5.2 will discuss defender \\ngoals in general terms and the resulting recommendations need to be tailored when applying \\nthem to a mission.
