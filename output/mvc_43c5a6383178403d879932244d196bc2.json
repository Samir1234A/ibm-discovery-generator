  "text": "technology will in many cases require a redesign of the \\nbusiness processes, as most are based on centralized control and/or trusted 3rd parties. \\nForce-fitting existing processes into a blockchain could result in centralizing a blockchain \\nand limiting its potential. 4. Application development is difficult. Smart contracts operate under an asynchronous \\nprogramming model as you dont know exactly when or if a transaction is added to the \\nchain. This is in sharp contrast to the dominant request/response model used by most web \\napplications today. Additionally, application logic must be programmed to be \\ndeterministic, which can limit the potential logic that can be ported to a smart contract. 5. There are variants of consensus algorithms used by permissioned blockchains. Not all are \\nintended to operate in a trust-less environment. Careful attention should be used in \\nselecting the right consensus algorithm for a given use case. 6. In the case of a permissioned blockchain, consideration needs to be made in terms of the \\ngovernance process. Since a permissioned blockchain is a closed group, participants must \\ndecide who will serve as the validating nodes in the consensus process. Additionally, a \\nprocess for managing user access must be consideredwho can participate, who has the \\npower to add or restrict users, etc. Without careful planning and proper governance, this \\ncould lead to a politically centralized blockchain by putting too much power in the hands \\nof a few. Potentially reducing some of the advantages and reasons for considering a \\nblockchain in the first place. 10 As noted in Section 4, there are predominately two types of blockchains. Each fit a specific need \\ndepending on the use case and the needs of the organization. Here are some additional factors \\nyou should consider when exploring blockchain technology: Do all participating parties trust each other? \\n Will more than one user be writing data to the system? \\n Is a trusted party required as part of the business process? \\n Do all participants need to see a synchronized view of the data? \\n Does the data need to be private? \\n Do you need to control who can deploy smart contracts to the system? One potential blockchain evaluation framework is shown in Figure 3. Potential Use Cases \\nApplication areas under investigation and of potential value to MITRE sponsors are numerous \\nand include healthcare, identity, supply chain (and logistics), Internet of Things (IoT), additive \\nmanufacturing, and secure information sharing among others. Several of these uses cases are \\npresented below. 6.1 Healthcare \\nBlockchain is being investigated as the foundation for numerous healthcare applications \\nincluding patient records, drug trials, medical supply chain, and payment processing. Bruce Broussard, president and CEO of Humana, posits blockchain will become the next big \\nhealthcare technology innovation, particularly as it relates to payments and payer contracts. For \\nexample, in a situation when a health plan and patient are dealing with a contract, the blockchain \\ncan automatically verify and authorize information and the contractual processes. There is no \\nmore back-and-forth haggling with the health plan about what was paid, why it was paid or \\nwhether it should have been paid, he wrote. With transparency and automation, greater \\nefficiencies will lead to lower administration costs, faster claims and less money wasted. \\n(Healthcare Information Tech) Another potential healthcare application is population health. Instead of relying on health \\ninformation exchanges or other ways to aggregate data, organizations can eliminate the \\nmiddleman and access patient databases on a large, population scale. Spending time and \\nresources verifying members' trustworthiness (e.g., Health Information Exchange [HIE], all-\\npayer claims database, or local Electronic Medical Records [EMRs]) no longer makes savvy \\nbusiness sense. Blockchain will leap frog population health by providing trust where none exists \\nfor continuous access to patient records by directly linking information to clinical and financial \\noutcomes, reports CIO. (Blockchain Apps for Healthcare) 11 Figure 3. Blockchain Decision Chart (IEEE: Do you need a blockchain). A registry of all devices connected to the Veterans Affairs (VA) IoT is a potential beneficial use \\nof blockchain. A second use could be digitizing the transactions of Veterans monetary benefits, \\nlike pension and compensation. Health researchers are also exploring using blockchain in \\nhealthcare records management. Blockchain could be used to securely exchange large volumes \\nof data while ensuring patient privacy and maintaining data integrity. Further, a blockchains \\nrecord-keeping ability could be used in VA hospitals to track a patients hospital visit, with \\ndevelopments tracked in a ledger as a transaction. (Tech Insight: Blockchain) 6.2 Identity \\nOnline identity management remains a time-consuming and costly process. There is much churn \\nwith respect to identity: for example, the Equifax breach has driven Congress and others to \\nrethink two major parts of the current credit system: having credit bureaus store most Americans \\nidentity data and using Social Security numbers as a primary identifier. 12 The ability to record, track, and manage identity on a blockchain has the potential to vastly \\nimprove the efficiency and minimize the cost of identity management; an immutable, trusted \\nsource of identity will make it difficult to steal, hack, modify, or otherwise damage reputation, or \\ncompromise identity to steal real assets or perpetrate fraud. A well-constructed blockchain identity solution would help consumers, businesses, and \\ngovernment alike; users can choose how much information to release on an as-needed basis. \\nTrusted information will save businesses and government time and money. Theres no doubt \\nthat the blockchain concept, with its power to prevent duplication and divergence from the chain, \\nis highly promising for identity, said Jo Ann Barefoot, a former deputy comptroller at the Office \\nof the Comptroller of the Currency. (Build a Better Credit Bureau, 2016) Identity is central to many activities of a typical consumers life. Its also applicable across a \\nwide range of MITREs sponsors. For example, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) \\nrecently awarded a Blockchain Tech development grant for identity. DHS is developing an \\nidentity management solution built on a permission-less blockchain, with a focus on \\nconfidentiality (with selective information disclosure), integrity, availability, non-DHS \\nrepudiation, provenance, and pseudo-anonymity. (DHS Awards Blockchain Grant) A good use case related to identity is trusted propagation of cancelled credentials; once your \\ncredentials are cancelled on the shared truth blockchain, it is visible to all valid participants and \\ntheres no way to game the system. Advances in biometrics plus digital identity and blockchain present interesting possibilities for \\nMITRE sponsors. HYPR is a startup using blockchain and biometrics for enterprise identity \\napplications. HYPR decentralizes and secures any type of credentials including passwords, \\nPersonal Identification Numbers (PINs), and biometric authentication such as fingerprint, face, \\nhand, retina, iris, voice, and behavior. (Decentralized Access Control) As with any asset management solution, there are issues of data freshness and integrity. \\nStandards for identity management using blockchain are not yet set and best practices are still \\nbeing developed. Research is needed into the blockchains ability to protect private information. \\nOnce information is recorded on the blockchain, it remains accessible to all parties in the \\nnetwork, so users must be aware to minimize any private information. 6.3 Supply Chain and Logistics \\nThe United States Department of Defense (DoD) is one of, if not the, largest logistics \\norganizations in the world; the challenges of procuring, tracking, deploying, and managing goods \\nis enormous. DoDs supply chain depends on an enormous number of globally distributed \\ncompanies, making it hard to oversee them all. This has traditionally been part of the challenge \\nof developing anti-counterfeit systems. Blockchain may offer a simpler way to comply, \\nbroadening the set of companies that can compete for military contracts without watering down \\noversight. (Pentagon has the World Largest Logistic Problem) Blockchain provides each participant end-to-end visibility based on their level of permission. \\nEach participant in the supply chain ecosystem can view the progress of goods through the \\nsupply chain to include origin, transit, and destination. They can also see the status of customs \\ndocuments, or view bills of lading and other data. Detailed visibility of the goods progress \\nthrough the supply chain is enhanced with the real-time exchange of original supply chain events \\nand documents. No one party can modify, delete, or even append any record without consensus \\nfrom others. This level of transparency helps reduce fraud and errors, reduce the time products 13 spend in the transit process, improve inventory management, and ultimately reduce waste and \\ncost. Blockchain supply chain solutions could extend to many other government groups as well, e.g., \\nverifying the provenance of medical equipment within the VA, tracking food and drug shipments \\nfor the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and generally managing supply chain risk any \\ngovernment entity. System issues must be carefully considered when using blockchain in supply chain and \\ncoordination applications. Data must be entered securely and accurately. Access to controlled \\nassets must be managed so that systems physical (and software) configurations remain in sync \\nwith the blockchain. Smart sensors, various ID tags, and workflow processes are critical items to \\nbuilding a complete blockchain-supported supply chain. 6.4 Internet of Things \\nThe IoT is impacting every segment of industry, consumers, and government. With tremendous \\ngrowth in smart devices comes many challenges including:",
