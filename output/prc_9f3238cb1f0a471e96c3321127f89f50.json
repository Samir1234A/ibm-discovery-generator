  "text": "the achieve or capture IM clearance types used the\\nIM sample algorithm. The speeds were not entered by the pseudo-pilots, but were flown\\nautomatically once the pseudo-pilot engaged IM. The participant flight crew aircraft was always capable of RNAV (but not the RNP RF turn) and\\nIM. The participant aircraft utilized the IM sample algorithm and always flew an achieve IM\\nclearance type. 6 TBFM assumed a final approach speed of 140 kts for all aircraft. 3-43 3.2 Participants\\nParticipant controllers were coordinated through the FAA and NATCA. The standard procedures\\ninvolved submitting a request with specific requirements, followed by approvals, and finally\\nidentification of participants. Controllers were compensated for their participation through\\nstandard FAA processes. Controller requirements included: Currently working at an ATC-10 or above STARS-equipped TRACON facility At least 2 years of experience as a Certified Professional Controller (CPC) Certified, operationally current, and holding a valid medical certificate (temporarily\\nmedically disqualified may qualify if current) No prior TSAS simulation experience Twelve controllers were desired for the simulation, but recruiting difficulties lead to nine total\\ncontrollers participating. The controllers acted as TRACON final and feeder controllers and were\\nfrom a variety of TRACONs, including: Atlanta (A80), Charlotte (CLT) [x2], Miami (MIA), Orlando\\n(F11), Philadelphia (PHL) [x2], Potomac (PCT), and Tampa (TPA). The tower controller positions\\nwere not staffed. Controllers had an average experience of 15.4 years (with a minimum of 7\\nyears and a maximum of 30.5 years) actively controlling air traffic. The average age of the\\ncontrollers was 39 years with a minimum of 30 years and a maximum of 53 years. Flight crews were recruited by MITRE. A request for participation was developed and\\ndistributed to members of the MITRE database. The request stated that each pilot was required\\nto be an Air Transport Pilot (ATP), have at least 100 hours of Federal Aviation Regulation Part\\n121 glass cockpit experience, be qualified in turbojet aircraft with auto throttles, and have\\noperated an aircraft using their ATP rating within the last 12 months. Pilots were told they\\nwould be compensated for their participation. It was desirable to have both pilots be from the same airline and to have a pairing of a Captain\\nand a First Officer (FO) for each simulation day. However, prior to recruiting, it was determined\\nthe results were not likely to be affected by not meeting either of these conditions. Therefore,\\nthese were determined to be goals but not requirements. A total of 18 pilots (acting as nine flight crews) were recruited and participated in the study.\\nSeven of the pilots were qualified as Captains and 11 were FOs. Their estimated average total\\nflight hours was 10,110 hours (with a minimum of 2500 hours and a maximum of 25,000 hours).\\nThe pilots were currently flying a variety of aircraft types, i.e., Airbus A319, A320, and A321, as\\nwell as Boeing 717, 737, 747, 757, 767, and 777. During the simulation, one pilot acted as the\\nPF, and one pilot acted as the PM. The roles were not switched during the simulation. MITRE staff members acted in two to four pseudo-pilot positions (depending on the number of\\ncontroller participants). The authors served as observers for both the flight crew controllers. 3-44 3.3 IM Operations\\nThe IM operations conducted in the simulation were as described in Section 2.2.1. This section\\nnotes some specific topics where changes, or specific implementation decisions, were made for\\nthis simulation. 3.3.1 Procedures\\nControllers were instructed to manage aircraft and sector operations as normal for TRACON\\nfacilities. They were also asked to keep aircraft on their RNAV or RNP RF route while using the\\nTSAS features and IM to achieve the schedule. They were told to intervene when necessary for\\nspacing or separation issues. Controllers were reminded that if they intervened when aircraft\\nwere flying the profile speeds on the arrival that they needed to direct the aircraft to resume\\nthe profile / normal speed. They were told to clear aircraft for the instrument approach when\\nacting as a final controller. Finally, the controllers were asked to hand off all aircraft to the\\ntower controller around the FAF. This is common at some facilities but less common at other\\nfacilities. Handing off around the FAF gave a consistent hand off point and allowed the\\ncontroller to monitor IM operations for as long as reasonably possible. For metering operations, controllers were told that the TSAS speed advisories were additional\\ninformation for issuing an appropriate speed and that they did not need to be implemented\\nexactly as presented. Controllers were asked to conduct IM and follow IM procedures and phraseology for any\\naircraft that was IM capable. Controllers were told that only the feeder controller should issue\\nthe IM clearance. They were asked to issue as many IM operations as possible, but that they\\ncould reject a proposed IM clearance if there was an operational reason to do so. They were\\ntold that when a no speed issue was presented to them, IM was possible between the pair of\\naircraft if a more aggressive speed assignment (than the 15% of the profile speed restriction) or\\nvector was utilized prior to initiating IM. They were also reminded that coordination was\\nnecessary between the lead aircraft controller and the trail aircraft controller if the lead aircraft\\ncontroller needed to vector that aircraft. Pilots were told they would be assigned the role of PF or PM and would remain in that role\\nthroughout the simulation. They were told to follow normal cockpit procedures and if there\\nwere differences in airline policies they should agree on an approach during training. They were\\nalso asked to fly the flight deck simulator as if it were a large category aircraft (versus a heavy).\\nThis was done based on expectations of having a larger pool of large category aircraft pilots and\\nbecause the aircraft model was more similar to a large aircraft model. Pilots were briefed that the PM should enter the IM clearance information and then coordinate\\nwith the PF on the entered information and the first IM speed prior to executing IM. They were\\nreminded that their tasks were to fly the IM speeds and to monitor the IM operation. They\\nwere told that the IM speeds overrode the profile speeds and that they should not announce\\neach IM speed to the controller. They were told that if the IM speed conformance advisory was\\ntriggered, that they should ensure the appropriate speed was set in the MCP and the aircraft\\nwas working toward the IM speed. Pilots were told that if the feasibility check was triggered 3-45 (and they could not continue IM), to fly the current speed, contact ATC, and report unable\\ninterval spacing. When the feasibility check was not in effect, but the pilots had either the\\nprogress indicator or the graphical progress indicator, they were told they should determine\\nwhether IM was progressing toward the ASG. If not, they were told to maintain the current\\nspeed, contact ATC, and report unable interval spacing. Pilots were told that the graphical\\nprogress indicator showed the acceptable tolerances of spacing and that they should not\\ndeviate from IM speeds to keep the triangle symbol centered. The PF was told to fly the IM\\nspeeds unless conditions prevented it or there were other operational reasons not to do so.\\nThe PM was told to call out any nonconformance with IM speeds or infeasible indications. Pilots\\nwere told they did not need to monitor for separation issues, as that remained the\\nresponsibility of ATC. 3.3.2 Communications\\nThis section will describe the specific communications used in this simulation. The phraseology\\nwas developed based on the most recent IM communications material at the time of simulation\\ndesign (DO-328A / RTCA, 2015b, DO-350A / RTCA, 2016a, DO-351A / RTCA, 2016b). During the\\ndevelopment of DO-350A (RTCA, 2016a) and DO-351A (RTCA, 2016b), controllers reported\\nissues with the use of the terms interval management or IM. The discussion led to the use\\nof interval spacing in that material. Therefore, that term was used in this simulation. Steps\\nwere taken to keep the IM clearance concise (e.g., avoiding using the PTP in the clearance by\\nmaking it part of the procedure and known to pilots [shown in the arrival and approach\\nprocedures] and controllers) The controllers had four specific IM communications: Initiation (samples) o AAL245 achieve 100 seconds by DERVL behind United 123 on EAGUL6 o SWA2598 capture 78 seconds behind FDX783 Suspend o Suspend interval spacing with speed instruction Resume o Resume interval spacing Terminate o Terminate interval spacing with speed instruction The controllers were asked to issue the IM clearance only as feeder controllers. However, either\\nthe feeder or final controller could suspend, resume, or terminate IM. The final controller was\\nresponsible for issuing the approach clearance for the RNAV approach with or without the RNP\\nRF turn. The phraseology consisted of: Cleared RNAV runway two six approach or Cleared RNP runway two six approach 3-46 Flight crews were told to perform normal readbacks. The only new phraseology for the flight\\ncrews was when reporting being unable to continue IM. They were told to say: Unable interval spacing 3.4 Simulation Procedures\\nA total of eighteen pilots participated in the simulation. Two pilots participated for one day per\\npair over the course of nine days. Controllers participated for a total of five days. During\\nsimulation planning, the expectation was that four controllers would participate over three\\nfive-day periods. However, due to recruiting issues, the number of controllers varied by the\\nfive-day period. The first five-day period had",
