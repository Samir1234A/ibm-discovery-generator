When\\nchoosing an option, keep in mind that IM is the area of interest (e.g., not a traffic display\\nalone). Unless otherwise indicated, consider all scenarios when answering. If you have any\\nquestions, please ask the experimenter. Operations 1. I received an acceptable number of IM speeds. (draw a line on the scale) Comments: 2.
