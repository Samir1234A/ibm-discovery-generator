Additionally, fewer advisories occurred with the min+ tool set (43/534; 8.1%) as\\ncompared to the min tool set (50/579; 8.6%), but the difference is greatly reduced when the\\nalert should have been triggered (Table 4-30).

It includes both pseudo-\\npilot and participant flight crew aircraft17. Measures in this section indicate how well the IM\\naircraft achieved or maintained the ASG, and also how well aircraft conformed to the\\nunderlying schedule and the associated slot markers. A detailed analysis of each of these\\nmeasures is not conducted in this paper. The main purpose of reviewing these measures is to\\ncompare how IM aircraft behaved relative to non-IM aircraft and whether they generally\\nbehaved the same. 16 As noted previously, the implementation for this simulation alerted more often than specified in DO-361 (RTCA,\\n2015a). 17 The participant flight crews only flew the achieve-by then maintain IM clearance (i.e., no capture then maintain).\\nPseudo-pilot aircraft flew all clearances. 4-36 4.5.1 Schedule Conformance\\nSchedule conformance measures how well aircraft met the original schedule at the various\\nconstraint points (including the ABPs and PTP for IM). The measure, termed schedule deviation,\\nis the difference between the STA and the ATA of an aircraft. Table 4-31 and Figure 4-30 show the schedule deviation at the constraint points. The first two\\ndata columns are the meter fixes. IM aircraft were not included at these points because it was\\ndifficult to determine whether or not aircraft had started IM. The non-IM aircraft are\\nrepresentative of the spacing of IM aircraft upon entering the TRACON. Aircraft, on average,\\nreached the meter fix ahead of schedule (by design, as described in Section 3.1.6). At the merge / DERVL, IM aircraft (M= -2.4; SD=11.9) had more schedule deviation and slightly\\nmore variance as compared to non-IM aircraft (M=0.0; SD=10.4). At the FAF / YOKXO, IM\\naircraft (M= -7.1; SD=10.9) had more schedule deviation and about the same variance as\\ncompared to non-IM aircraft (M= -4.9; SD=11.2). At the merge / DERVL, IM aircraft had a mean deviation from schedule of less than 6 seconds\\nand similar variances but the achieve-by type (M= -5.3; SD=12.1), had more schedule deviation\\nthan the achieve-by then maintain (M= -1.1; SD=12.1) or the capture then maintain (M= -2.3;\\nSD=10.9). At the FAF / YOKXO, all IM aircraft terminated IM. IM aircraft had a mean deviation\\nfrom schedule within 1 second of each other and similar variances. All aircraft were ahead of schedule, on average, at YOKXO (the FAF). Table 4-31.

Schedule Deviation at Constraint Points 4.5.2 Aircraft Position as Related to Slot Markers\\nThis section provides information on how each aircraft deviated from the center of the slot\\nmarkers (Section 4.5.2.1 Absolute Slot Marker Deviation), the amount of time aircraft were in\\ntheir slot markers (Section 4.5.2.2 Aircraft Time in Slot Markers), and the difference between\\nthe deviation from the center of the slot marker for a trail aircraft as compared to its lead\\naircraft (Section 4.5.2.3 Relative Slot Marker Deviation). 4.5.2.1 Absolute Slot Marker Deviation\\nThe absolute slot marker deviation metric shows how close an individual aircraft was to the\\ncenter of its slot marker. A positive value indicates the aircraft was (behind schedule and)\\nbehind the center of the slot marker. A negative value indicates the aircraft was (ahead of\\nschedule and) ahead of the center of the slot marker. A zero value indicates the aircraft was\\ncentered in its slot marker (see Appendix D for examples). Aircraft were delivered from en route into feeder airspace with a distribution around the slot\\nmarkers. The feeder controller was expected to work to get non-IM aircraft on schedule / into\\ntheir slot markers before handing off to the final controller. IM aircraft were working toward\\nachieving or maintaining the ASG, regardless of slot marker position. The final controller 4-38 received the aircraft and was expected to get non-IM aircraft on schedule / into their slot\\nmarkers (until around the final approach path where the controller is likely more concerned\\nabout the relative spacing between aircraft than the schedule). Table 4-32 shows both time and distance (shaded gray) for deviations from the center of the\\nslot marker by overall time in feeder and final airspace and at the handoff from final to feeder.\\nDistance is included for a general reference, while time is discussed for the results. Figure 4-31,\\nFigure 4-32, and Figure 4-33 show the distributions of the time deviation. Lines are shown in\\nthese figures for the slot marker radius for the feeder (15 seconds) and the final (5 seconds)\\ncontrollers. Table 4-32.

At the handoff, the IM aircraft (M=1.9; SD=6.0)\\nwere further behind schedule and further behind the slot marker center as compared to the\\nnon-IM aircraft (M=0.1; SD=4.7). In final controllers airspace, IM (M= -12.9; SD=12.6) and non-\\nIM aircraft (M= -11.1; SD=9.3) had similar deviations from the slot marker center and were\\nahead of schedule. In the feeders airspace, aircraft with the achieve-by clearance types (M= -15.7; SD=20.0) were\\nfurther behind the slot marker center as compared to aircraft with the capture then maintain\\nclearance type (M= -12.5; SD=16.4). At the handoff, aircraft with the achieve-by clearance types\\n(M=2.0; SD=6.4) and aircraft with capture then maintain clearance type (M=1.8; SD=5.5) had\\nsimilar deviations behind the slot marker center. In the final controllers airspace, aircraft with\\nthe achieve-by clearance types (M= -13.6; SD=12.8) and aircraft with capture then maintain\\nclearance type (M= -12.2; SD=12.4) had similar deviations ahead of the slot marker center. The general trend appears to be that all aircraft in the feeder airspace were ahead of schedule,\\non average. This is, in part, based on the distribution of aircraft around the slot marker center\\nwhen received from en route airspace as more aircraft were delivered ahead of schedule (as\\ndescribed in Section 3.1.6). Then, all aircraft were delivered by the feeder to final controller on\\naverage within 2 seconds of their slot marker centers. In the final controllers airspace, all 4-39 aircraft were, on average, ahead of the slot marker centers. Most differences between IM and\\nnon-IM aircraft, and the two IM clearance types, were minor.
