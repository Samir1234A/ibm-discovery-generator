(circle one) Yes No Dont Know If yes, explain: D-1 Appendix D Descriptions of Objective Measures This section provides descriptions and, where appropriate, details on each of the objective\\nmeasures. D.1 IM Operations Conduct\\n IM initiation delay by the controller o Definition: Difference in time between when the IM clearance was presented to the\\ncontroller and it was accepted by controller action IM initiation point o Definition: Position where IM started as defined by controller acceptance action Frequency of IM initiations by the controller o Definition: Number of times the controller initiated IM after an IM operation was\\npresented Frequency of IM rejections by the controller o Definition: Number of times the controller refused an IM clearance after it was\\npresented Frequency and location of IM suspensions by the controller o Definition: Location and number of times the controller took action to make IM\\ntemporarily inactive Frequency and location of IM terminations by the controller, as well as flight crew\\nreports of unable IM o Definition: Location and number of times IM is made inactive Frequency of flight crew reports of unable IM o Definition: Number of times participants reported being unable to conduct IM D.2 IM Speeds and Flight Crew Actions\\n Frequency of IM speed changes o Definition: Number of times a new IM speed is presented Magnitude of IM speed change relative to previous IM speed o Definition: Degree of change between IM speeds D-2 Frequency of IM speed reversals o Definition: This occurs when a previous IM speed change was an increase that is\\nthen followed by an IM speed decrease (or vice versa). Table D-1 provides examples\\nof situations that are and are not considered reversals. Table D-1. Speed Reversal Determination Methodology IM speed\\n(current -2) IM speed\\n(current -1) IM speed\\n(current) Reversal? 180 Increase to 190 Increase to 200 No 180 Increase to 190 Decrease to 180 Yes 200 Decrease to 190 Increase to 200 Yes 200 Decrease to 190 Decrease to 180 No Frequency of IM speed increases o Definition: This occurs when the previous IM speed was lower than a new IM speed Time between IM speed changes and distance to go o Definition: How often IM speeds changed relative to how close the aircraft was from\\nthe runway Frequency of flight crew compliance with IM speeds o Definition: Measure of whether the flight crew dialed the IM speed into the MCP\\nwindow o Note: While ideally compliance would be zero difference between the MCP speed\\nand the IM speed, the simulation MCP implementation sometimes made it difficult\\nto match the number exactly. Therefore, setting the MCP speed to +/- 2 knots of the\\nIM speed was considered compliance in this simulation Frequency of IM Speed Conformance Monitoring Advisories o Definition: The number of times the equipment determined that the IM speed was\\nnot being conformed with and displayed an advisory to the flight crew D-3 D.3 Aircraft Spacing and Separation\\n Schedule conformance at various points (e.g., TRACON entry, constraint points) o Definition: Difference between the aircrafts STA and ATA o Note: This measure is an indication of whether aircraft were on schedule (but does\\nnot directly indicate whether aircraft were in their slot markers or how their\\nschedule conformance relates to the aircraft ahead or behind) Absolute slot marker deviation o Definition: Difference between aircraft position and the center of the slot marker o Note: This measure is more operational than the schedule conformance measure\\nand provides information about whether an aircraft was in the slot marker, and if\\nnot, how far outside. It does not indicate how its slot marker position relates to the\\naircraft ahead or behind. o Note: The on-going measures in the controller airspace were determined by voice\\nfrequency changes (e.g., feeder airspace was bounded by checking in on the feeders\\nfrequency and then checking in on the finals frequency) o Note: See Figure D-1 for slot marker deviation examples Aircraft time in slot markers o Definition: The amount of time aircraft were inside the slot markers o Note: Slot markers had a radius of 15 seconds in the feeder controllers airspace and\\n5 seconds in the final controllers airspace Relative slot marker deviation o Definition: Difference between trail aircraft position and the center of the slot\\nmarker and the lead aircraft position and the center of the slot marker o Note: This measure is more operational than the schedule conformance measure\\nand provides relative spacing information. For example, if a lead is outside its slot\\nmarker, this measure will show if the trail aircraft is outside its slot marker in the\\nsame or opposite direction. When aircraft are performing IM, the expected behavior\\nat the ABP would be that the trail IM aircraft is outside its slot marker in the same\\ndirection and magnitude as the lead aircraft. o Note: This was measured when the lead (instead of the trail) crossed the points to\\navoid any issues (e.g., lead landed) inside the FAF. o Note: See Figure D-1 for relative slot marker deviation examples D-4 Figure D-1. Slot Marker Deviation Relative Slot Marker Deviation Trial position same\\n0 relative error Trail ahead an equal amount\\n0 relative error Trail behind slot marker\\nPositive relative spacing error Lead in center of the slot marker Lead ahead of the center of the slot marker Lead behind the center of the slot marker Trail ahead of slot marker\\nNegative relative spacing error Trail behind a different amount\\nPositive relative spacing error Trail behind an equal amount\\n0 relative error Trail ahead a different amount\\nPositive relative spacing error Trail ahead a different amount\\nNegative relative spacing error Trail not ahead\\nPositive relative spacing error Trail not behind\\nNegative relative spacing error Trail behind a different amount\\nNegative relative spacing error D-5 Spacing error o Definition: Error in meeting the ASG (for trail IM aircraft) or the TBFM interval (for\\nnon-IM aircraft) o Note: This measure indicates how well a pair did relative to the planned interval\\nbetween aircraft, even if off the original schedule (slots irrelevant). This is a relative\\nmeasure. For trail IM aircraft, it is a measure of how well the ASG was met. For non-\\nIM aircraft, it is a measure of how well aircraft met the TBFM-planned interval. o Note: For the IM aircraft: (ATAtrail at the ABP- ATAlead at the ABP) ASG For non-IM aircraft: (ATAtrail at the ABP- ATAlead at the fix) (STAtrail at the ABP -\\nSTAlead at the fix) How well the ASG was maintained o Definition: Difference between ASG and current spacing of the trail IM aircraft from\\nthe lead aircraft Note: For capture operations, started measure once trail IM aircraft got within\\n10 seconds Frequency and location where aircraft pairs spacing was below the separation standard o Definition: Location and number of times spacing between an aircraft pair was\\nbelow the applicable separation standard for the aircraft pairing and location Arrival rates / throughput (AAR number of aircraft per hour) o Definition: Number of aircraft landing (AAR number of aircraft per hour) Time aircraft remained on the RNAV arrival procedure o Definition: Amount of time aircraft remained on their route o Note: Indication of whether a spacing operation was working well enough to avoid\\naircraft being vectored off their optimized route E-1 Appendix E Relative Slot Marker Analysis Detail This section provides the data used to derive the figures in Section 4.5.2.3. Slot marker\\ndeviations are shown in Table E-1 (seconds) and Table E-2 (NM) when the lead aircraft was\\nahead of its slot marker center. Figure E-1 shows a graphical representation. Slot marker\\ndeviations are shown in Table E-3 (seconds) and Table E-4 (NM) when the lead aircraft was\\nbehind its slot marker center. Figure E-2 shows a graphical representation. Table E-1.
