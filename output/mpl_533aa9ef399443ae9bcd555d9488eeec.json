The second was the 28R \\nFinal controller, who communicated directly with a pseudopilot. iv\\n Figure 4-3: Combined Monitor Configuration Communications Environment Figure 4-4 shows the communications environment for the Separate Monitor configuration. \\nTwo separate loops were created: the first for the 28L Monitor controller (participant) who \\nmonitored the frequency with a 28L Local controller and the pseudopilot managing the traffic \\narriving on 28L. The second was the 28R Monitor controller, who monitored a frequency \\nbetween the 28R Local controller and the corresponding pseudopilot managing arrival traffic to \\n28R. Figure 4-4. Communications Environment: Separate Monitor Configuration The communications configuration shown in Figure 4-5 was used for the Combined Monitor \\nAlert Timing and Lateral Deviation Combined Monitor Scenarios, as described in Section 4.5. v\\n Only one loop was created: a 28L/R Combined Monitor controller (participant) monitored the \\nfrequency with a Combined 28L/R Local controller and the pseudopilot managing the traffic \\narriving to both runways. Two versions of this configuration were run at the same time, \\nindependent and in parallel. Figure 4-5. Single Participant Configuration Communications Environment IM PA Ground Tools5.2\\nAs discussed in Section 3.1, new ground tools are expected to be required to allow controllers to \\nprovide a timely response to an aircraft deviation in either the longitudinal (along-track) or \\nlateral (i.e., blunder) dimensions. Several new display features were therefore introduced and \\nevaluated in the HITL to support IM initiation and monitoring functions. The following list \\nsummarizes the new display features and notes the sections of this report in which the features \\nare described: IM Spacing List with IM PA Initiation Information (Section 4.2.1).\\nData Block Display of IM Status and the Distances to the CSL and WSL (Section 4.2.3).\\nLine Representing the CSL (Section 4.2.4).\\nLine Representing the WSL (Section 4.2.5).\\nWSL Preview Line (WSL-P) (Section 4.2.6).\\nSafety limit Predictive Alert and Caution Alert (Section 4.2.7).\\nLateral Boundaries and Exceedance Warning (Section 4.2.8). The IM Spacing List and Lateral Boundary features were developed by MITRE through research \\nsupported by the FAAs SBS and ANG-C1 organizations. The other, IM PA-specific monitoring \\ntools were developed by MITRE and supported by the FAAs CSPO Program Office. Tool design \\ndepends on the PA Separation Standard assumed for the HITL, so those assumptions are \\ndetailed in the following section. Detailed description for each of the IM PA tools is then \\ndescribed in the sub-sections that follow. PA Separation Standard Assumed for the HITL5.2.1\\nAs described in Section 2.2.3, IM PA will require a new dependent parallel runway separation \\nstandard. The FAA has not yet begun to define this standard, however, so one needed to be \\nassumed for the HITL experiment to inform: 1) suggested controller tasking and procedures, and \\n2) the design of the supporting monitoring tools and display features. vi\\n Previous research (Stassen, et al., 2017) suggests that although wind-independent IM PA \\noperations at SFO requiring a WSL are likely infeasible, wake-free IM PA operations (that do not \\nrequire a WSL) may be possible for more than 80% of the potential IM PA operations. As one of \\nthe primary objectives of the HITL is to examine controller monitoring with respect to both \\nsafety limits being active at the same time, it will assume that the implementation includes IM \\nPA pairs that require a WSL. Therefore, the key PA separation standard characteristics assumed \\nfor the HITL experiment included: The PA separation standard is defined by the safety limit values and guarantees \\nprotection from collision in the event of a deviation by either the IM Trail Aircraft or IM \\nLead Aircraft and from a hazardous wake encounter. \\nThe safety limit values are dependent on facility geometry and independent of avionics \\ncapability. An IM termination does not automatically mean that PA separation is lost.\\nNo single safety limit value applies to a pair of aircraft for the entirety of the approach. \\nBoth the forward standard and aft standard change as a function of the Lead Aircrafts \\nproximity to its runway threshold. Some aircraft pairings do not require a WSL. For the purpose of the HITL, controllers were informed that separation is assured if the IM Trail \\nAircraft remains within the safety limits. The CSL values used in the HITL experiment are shown \\nin blue in Figure 4-6, and were based on AFS, Flight Technologies Division, Flight Systems Lab \\n(AFS-450) Monte-Carlo simulations at SFO and provided to RTCA SC-186 WG4 (Williams & \\nWood, 2017). The Monte-Carlo simulations examined longitudinal spacings between IM and \\nTarget Aircraft until an acceptable collision probability was found (1x10-9). Figure 4-6. CSL and WSL Values Used in the HITL vii\\n A WSL value of 1.5 NM, starting when the IM Lead Aircraft was 2 NM from the runway \\nthreshold, was assumed for IM PA pairs involving a heavy category aircraft as the lead. This is \\nshown as the red line in Figure 4-6. Collision protection from a lateral deviation (i.e., blunder) is assured by the controller being \\nrequired to take action to keep the IM Trail Aircraft from crossing the CSL. There is no \\nexpectation that controllers provide lateral deviation protection beyond this, therefore no \\nearly detection and protection requirements were assumed. However, because the CSL and \\nWSL comprise the PA separation standard for the HITL, it was assumed that the controller \\nparticipants need to know how much lateral deviation the limits have been designed to \\naccommodate. If either aircraft then goes beyond that amount in either direction (left or right), \\nthen PA separation would no longer apply. Therefore, controllers were informed that the PA \\nseparation standard (CSL and WSL) applies as long as the IM Lead Aircraft and IM Trail Aircraft \\nremain within defined lateral boundaries. Though the general concept for these boundaries was \\ndiscussed and agreed upon by FAA stakeholders and operational experts, the implementation in \\nthis HITL, as described in Section 4.2.8, was the first attempt at a specific design. IM Spacing List with IM PA Initiation Information5.2.2\\nThe IM Spacing List provided the necessary information to enable the 28R Final controller to \\ninitiate the IM PA operation. The list was also displayed to the Monitor controller and provided \\nIM Status information and an interface to the automation to indicate when IM PA was \\nterminated early. The IM Spacing List design was based on that used in the 2017 IM TSAS HITL \\nreported in Bone & Mendolia (2018). An example IM Spacing List is depicted in Figure 4-7 and \\ncontrollers could position it as desired on the STARS display. Figure 4-7. IM Spacing List with IM PA Initiation Information The IM Spacing List display included a list of proposed aircraft pairings, associated Assigned \\nSpacing Goals, and status (i.e., eligible, active, terminated). The order of the text was presented \\nto reflect how the IM Clearance would likely be issued via voice. The IM Spacing List also \\nincluded an accept or reject function, which enabled the controller to indicate to the \\nautomation that the IM PA operation had been successfully initiated or not. Final controllers \\nused the STARS keyboard keystroke sequence [MULTI FUNC]-[T]-[A]-SLEW (Lead+Trail Selection) \\nto accept an IM Clearance. This triggered the automation to activate and display, as \\nappropriate, the IM PA monitoring tools, including changing the Status field in the IM Spacing \\nList to Active. To terminate an IM operation, Final or Monitor controllers used the STARS \\nkeyboard keystroke sequence [MULTI FUNC]-[T]-[T]-SLEW (Trail Selection). This removed the IM \\nPA information from the radar display and changed the Status field in the IM Spacing List to \\nTerminated. The text in the IM Spacing List was colored based on the status: white if eligible, \\ngreen if active, and yellow if terminated. viii\\n The proposed IM PA pairs consisted of a variety of weight categories and initial spacings. An IM \\nPA feasibility check was assumed to prevent the automation from proposing pairs for IM PA \\nthat arrive outside of the initial spacing window and thus are unlikely to remain within the \\nsafety limits. It was not assumed, however, that this check was sufficient to predict all possible \\ninfeasible operations. For example, scenarios included off-nominal conditions in which IM PA \\noperations were proposed where an IM Trail Aircraft arrived near the CSL at the start of the \\napproach and subsequently could not slow down quickly enough to remain behind the CSL. As this list would likely be the same across the Feeder, Final, and Monitor controller positions, \\neligible IM PA pairs were displayed before they entered the Final controllers area. It was \\nassumed that any flight crew rejection of the initial Partial IM Clearance message would \\nhappen in feeder airspace. Therefore, Final controllers could assume that eligible pairs \\nappearing on the IM Spacing List had already accepted the Partial IM Clearance. Data Block Display of IM Status and CSL and WSL Values5.2.3\\nThe data block provided an indication of the IM Trail Aircraft and IM Lead Aircraft IM Status to \\nthe controllers and was incorporated into the data blocks similar to Bone & Mendolia (2018). \\nFor the IM Trail Aircraft, a T(E) symbol in Line 3 indicated a proposed IM Clearance (Trail \\nEligible), as shown in Figure 4-8. A T(A) symbol indicated an active",

  "text": "and consistent with the psychological literature: depression has been shown to cause people to literally see the world through a colorless lens, and reduce their social activity. So while the results are not necessarily surprising, what is remarkable is that they hold even when we restrict model training to pictures posted prior to the date of diagnosis, demonstrating predictive skill. Furthermore, the model outperformed general practitioners average unassisted diagnostic success rate for depression. 9 Predicting Depression and PTSD from Twitter | # | \\n \\nIn a companion study, we investigated predictors of depression & PTSD using twitter messages. Linguistic style, sentiment, and meta-data were used to train supervised learning algorithms. Resulting models successfully discriminated between depressed and healthy content, and compared favorably to general practitioners average success rates. Again, the results held even when the analysis was restricted to content posted before first depression diagnosis, suggesting that onset of depression and PTSD may be detectable several months prior to formal diagnosis. Machine learning models. We trained supervised machine learning classifiers to discriminate between affected and healthy sample members observations. Classifiers were trained on a randomly-selected 70% of total observations, and tested on the remaining 30%. Out of several candidate algorithms, a 1200-tree Random Forests classifier demonstrated best performance. \\nWe trained a two-state Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to detect differential changes between affected and healthy groups over time. 10 Pilot Study at University of Vermont (UVM): \\nPredictors of Suicide Risk\\nUsing social media to identify predictors of suicide risk Extending from two previous studies (Instagram and Twitter) Leveraging unique dataset from UVM hopstial \\n1500 individuals who have died by suicide in VT, NH and northern NY\\nNames, cities, activity matched w/100 billion tweets in last decade | # | \\n \\nBig picture: The results of our work and that of colleagues suggest that early-warning signs of emerging mental health issues like depression and PTSD can be observed in social media, even before any clinical diagnosis is made.
