  "text": "test facilities and laboratories, wherever they are, to the U.S. test and evaluation \\nnetworks or their equivalents, with appropriate training and assurances so as to enable distributed live, virtual and \\nconstructive experimentation and cybersecurity vulnerability assessments and penetration testing of every software-\\nintensive system on the submarine to the latest cybersecurity threat levels.\\n Using linked and distributed test facilities to enable agile development and test, so the ally can reduce \\ndevelopment, test, operations and sustainment costs and stay ahead of cyber adversaries.\\n Undertake Quantum Network Mapping (the subject of ongoing research by Authors one and two) of each \\nsubmarines unique cyber-attack surface.\\n Obtaining independent review by cybersecurity and test professionals of all test concept strategies and plans. CONCLUSIONIX.\\nAustralias Future Submarine Project illustrates the modern challenge of advancing a significant new complex deterrent while being resilient to new cyber warfare threats, and doing so without risking fundamental design rework \\nand associated capability limitations. Key to any submarine development are land-based test sites and using them to \\nattain and maintain cyber-resilience of the critical systems. A serious concern with any delays in such test capability is \\nthat the foreign designer and builder can hold technical sway over Knowledge Transfer and project direction. It may \\nsuit commercial purposes for such test sites to be deferred, so foreign sites pick up the slack. Such an outcome would \\nseriously impair Knowledge Sovereignty, Knowledge Transfer and independent test capability in the difficulties of \\nforeign release. Cyber is becoming the cheap first-strike weapon of choice by potential adversaries in a kind of merging of \\ninsurgency, terrorism, international crime and state-based influences. The merging of electronic warfare and cyber-\\nwarfare means not even submarines, however unconnected or firewalled they may be, are immune to probing of, and \\ninterference with, its systems. Future submarines must not only survive and be credible in this Information Age, but \\nactually ought to be a potential purveyor of offensive cyber if it is to be our contemporary deterrence. To do so, \\nsubmarine systems have to respond dynamically to a quantum attack surface for its past designs, current builds, and \\nfuture operations. Cybersecurity craft in the U.S. has found that the most critical of Defence systems, like submarines, \\nnuclear weapons and space surveillance, require to be trusted systems, meaning that their computer and software \\ncomponents, applications and architectures need to be designed, assembled, tested and refreshed using personnel, \\ncompanies and procedures that are, and remain, highly-trusted suppliers. Moreover, recent work in the U.S. may enable \\ntrusted sidecar cyber-threat adaptive embedded components to give greater cybersecurity assurance while retaining \\ncost effective use of commercial computers and software. Some countries like Australia have precious few chip, processor, board and software manufacturers for Defence \\nIndustry, all who should be key for sovereign resilience of a submarine program, including its test sites. The high-level \\nrequirements of submarines need to have cyber-resilience as a key feature and then flow these through to the key \\ncybersecurity plans like those usual in a U.S. project (i.e. Project Protection Plan). There needs to be sovereign industry \\nengagement to establish cyber-trusted supply chains in time for the test sites and sovereign oversight of the \\ncybersecurity of any foreign designers and builders, or otherwise these prime contractors will not be commercially \\nmotivated to adjust extant supply chains, or subject them to new scrutiny, in order to provide for Knowledge Transfer \\n(and so Knowledge Sovereignty) and to establish a robust, perennial and independent cybersecurity test framework. 8 Foreign contractors should not be given untested and unfettered technical deference in this key future threat area or \\nexpensive new deterrent submarines risk being vulnerable to relative low-cost cyber warfare threats. ACKNOWLEDGMENT X.\\nThe examination of the cybersecurity challenges and processes for the Australian Submarine Program was presented initially to the Australian Submarine Institutes annual conferences in 2017 [1] and the Institute has kindly agreed for \\nthese aspects to be used herein for broader implications.This research was greatly assisted by a number of students \\nundertaking postgraduate coursework in cybersecurity, in particular Mr Kenan Erem, Mr Thomas Coughlin, Mr \\nChristopher Leedham and Ms Anne Coull.
