  "text": "come with a weekly notification email with updates on Trusted Advisor check statuses and potential savings. In the console, cost optimization can be selected to view suggested cost-reducing system changes. By tracking recent changes and checks such as low utilization Amazon EC2 Instances, Trusted Advisor helps reduce costs in ones AWS environment. 20 4.4 AWS Budgets AWS Budgets can be used to automate the continuous monitoring of costs. Rather than constantly checking costs or usage, the Budgets tool can be utilized to alert the team when thresholds are reached that may lead to unexpected spending. The team can choose to monitor based on estimated costs and predicted costs, but can also set up alerts for monitoring the utilization of resources, such as a Reserved Instance. Using this in conjunction with AWS Organizations and CloudWatch alarms, the PMO can allow users to create account-specific budgets which can then be viewed through the budget dashboard and monitored via alerts from email, Slack, or Amazon Chime. Utilizing AWS Budgets costs $0.02 per day per account. 4.5 AWS CloudWatch While Budgets focuses on monitoring cost and utilization thresholds, AWS CloudWatch monitors and automatically reacts to system health and performance issues. CloudWatch consolidates logs and metrics generated by each AWS service to provide quickly-digestible information to the team in the dashboard and through alerts. Beyond simply alerting the team to take action, CloudWatch allows users to set automated actions in which workflows are triggered by either user-specified thresholds or anomalies detected by Amazons machine learning algorithms. For instance, changes in resource demand could trigger CloudWatch to enable auto- scaling for an EC2 instance. CloudWatch can provide extreme granularity, collecting metrics as frequently as every second and publishing them every minute. The information CloudWatch publishes in this process is available via the CloudWatch dashboard and API. 4.6 AWS CloudTrail AWS CloudTrail is necessary to help the team manage security and compliance across accounts by monitoring account activity and mitigating risk. Through this service, account activity is tracked and workflows can be triggered to maintain high security with minimal oversight. For example, if an API call makes an S3 bucket public, CloudTrail will log this event and can respond by automatically adding specific security policies to the S3 bucket. In the white paper Security at Scale: Logging in AWS, Amazon demonstrates how easy it is to track and retrieve activity data for auditing and enforcing compliance standards. CloudTrail comes free of charge, though S3 storage is needed to store log data. 4.7 Cost Optimization Monitor The AWS Cost Optimization Monitor consolidates billing reports into an S3 bucket and presses the data for viewing and retrieval in an Elasticsearch service. With this feature enabled, users can utilize Kibana dashboards to search and visualize aggregated cost data as seen in Figure 5. For example, the teams Kibana dashboard may display cost by EC2 hours per dollar invested, instances running per hour, or cost by instance type. The Cost Optimization Monitor tool is available to the account that makes payments through the consolidated billing feature (see 21 Section 4.1). To use this feature, the team launches the Cost Optimization Monitor stack and then configures the payment account to save billing reports to a designated S3 bucket. Charges for this service are billed by Amazon Elasticsearch instance hours and storage, Amazon EC2 usage and licensing, and Elastic Load Balancing base pricing. The cost per hour will also fluctuate depending on deployment size, master node count and type, and data node count and type. The lowest cost per hour is estimated to be $0.40 and the highest cost per hour is estimated to be $3.83. \\nFigure 7 Cost Optimization Monitor architecture 4.8 AWS Cost and Usage Report AWS Cost and Usage Reports are another method for reviewing each accounts spending. This report type focuses on views by product, usage type, operations, more detailed information by Reserved Instance type, and the unique combinations of each of these attributes. By using the Consolidated Billing feature from AWS Organizations, the master account will have access to cost and usage reports for each linked account. These reports can be downloaded from the S3 console, accessed through the AWS Billing and Cost Management API, or queried through an Amazon service such as Redshift, QuickSight, or Athena. While there is no cost to access these reports, storing reports in S3 will incur normal S3 storage costs. Up to ten cost reports can be created per account which make cumulative estimated costs available throughout the month with information aggregated by the hour or the day. One finalized report will be provided by Amazon each month containing final calculations for all blended (affected by instance type and rate) and unblended rates, usage, and cost changes (e.g., due to refunds or credits). 22 Cost Optimization Programmatic Best Practices \\nBefore deploying services and cost optimization tools, it is better to first examine the programs current practices and work to craft a cost-conscious system. A Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) team should be appointed to monitor and enact the following practices and services within the programs environment. The following best practices will help guide the project toward being more cost-aware and, ultimately, minimize cloud-related expenses. 5.1 Architecture Every government program needs to be deliberate about where it houses data and how it transfers data. Begin with a consumption model to determine current computing requirements based on the programs historical usage, then modify these requirements using cost optimization tools such as AWS Auto Scaling and Cost Explorer. Once these cost optimization tools have been introduced, there should be periodic reviews of the architecture to determine potential areas of improvement. 5.2 DevOps The fundamental principle of any DevOps system is the ability to frequently release updates in order to shorten delivery time to the customer. In addition to time savings, an effective DevOps pipeline should reduce program costs over the entirety of its lifecycle, including the operation and maintenance phases. Sharing resources in the cloud environment during the integration phase can save on costs as well, while limiting to only necessary resources and keeping unused resources shut down. DevOps allows for continuous testing and monitoring which can find software bugs and apply fixes quicker. This can also be used for tracking cost optimization models to ensure they are running the correct instances and deploying resources only when needed to maximize cost reduction. 5.3 Lean Culture Lean culture focuses on reducing waste by defining value, mapping value streams, creating flow, establishing pull-based systems, and pursuing perfection. Government agencies should implement a lean culture which clearly delineates its customer value and continuously tweaks its business process to maximize that value. Any processes that are deemed unnecessary for the customer should be reduced or eliminated. The process should be regularly evaluated to ensure a steady flow of progress is maintained across teams, enabling employees to adapt to changing customer needs. A pull-based system is defined as a system where the customers product is delivered when the products are needed and limiting the amount of in-progress items. Finally, always test and improve upon any products delivered to the customer. In an agile system, it is important to get a functioning product released, then re-evaluate and perfect the system by reviewing customer feedback. 23 5.4 AWS-Oriented Business Process Re-Engineering In order to facilitate cost savings, the government program can collect usage statistics for its AWS services and consider re-engineering its business process to minimize expenditures. For example, if certain data is housed for longer than necessary, the business process could be re- engineered to reduce storage duration (and therefore overall storage volume). In accordance with lean principles, when re-engineering the business process is important to minimize task duration by eliminating low-value tasks and appropriately dividing or combining tasks based on the size and time to completion. On top of this, tasks should be ordered based on required delivery date, available work capacity, and size. Tasks can either be done sequentially or in parallel depending on if it relies on information from external sources to complete the task. Employees should be given more control in the decision making process for their assigned tasks. It will save time and reduce overhead costs if employees are comfortable making decisions without requiring constant authorization and oversight. 5.5 Policy-Driven Automation Utilize business policies to track automated processes, enable easily-adjustable automation, and understand the holistic effects of automation. Additionally, usage metrics can inform business policies and enable smarter policies. Incorporate methods to monitor GovCloud usage and determine which processes can (and cannot) be automated. Monitoring can be done using tags to track instance usage and filter by both application type and deployment zone (i.e., region or availability zone). There should be one centralized system or tool to monitor the GovCloud environment. 24 DevSecOps GovCloud Evaluation \\nThis section provides an evaluation of the state of a standard DevSecOps GovCloud environment with the information that was available at the time of this technical report.
