The year-over-year \\nincrease in revenue was driven primarily by increased work mainly with the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Health and Human \\nServices and Medicare & Medicaid Services areas. This growth more than offset the reduction of revenue due to MITREs conclusion of the \\nindependent assessment of the Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system through the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act \\nof 2014 (known as VA Choice). Assets increased year-over-year by $44 million, driven primarily by increases to property, plant, and equipment \\nrelated to ongoing building construction as the company works to consolidate its McLean, Virginia, operations onto its main campus. Staff \\npopulation increased year-over-year, which reflects current and anticipated demand and shifts in the work program. $ 62 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t Locations MITRE is headquartered in Bedford, Massachusetts, and McLean, Virginia, with our newly established R&D site in Singapore. We have sites across the country and the world. MITRE 4 opened in fall 2016 and consolidates nearly all McLean-based employees on one campus, enhancing our collaboration and knowledge sharing. The environmentally friendly building is dedicated to long-term chairman James Schlesinger and includes several cutting- edge laboratories devoted to innovation and experimentation. 63T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n MITREs leaders manage the governments investment in us wisely, ethically, and responsibly. Our executive team together with our Board of Trustees brings the high level of expertise needed to tackle the governments biggest challenges and achieve mission success. \\nLeadership 64 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t With\\nAppreciation The Honorable Charles Robb joined MITREs board in 2001, and during his tenure he brought valuable insight as the first U.S. Senator to simultaneously serve on the Armed Services, Foreign Relations, and Intelligence committees. We were fortunate to have his leadership as vice chairman from 2006 through 2014 and as chairman until his retirement in October 2016. To recognize his service to the company, we have dedicated the auditorium in the new MITRE 4 building in his name and are establishing a National Merit scholarship for the children of MITRE employees. 65T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n Executive \\nTeam Mr. Alfred Grasso\\nPresident and \\nChief Executive Officer Mr. Richard Byrne\\nSenior Vice President, Programs and \\nTechnology, Center for Connected \\nGovernment Ms. Julie Bowen\\nVice President, General Counsel, \\nand Corporate Secretary Mr. James Cook\\nVice President and Director, \\nCenter for Enterprise Modernization Dr. Gregory Crawford\\nVice President, Joint and Services \\nPortfolio, National Security \\nEngineering Center Mr. John M.
