  "text": "parameters and \\nlogic that can impact the arrival management tool (i.e., general airspace, routing, runways, or scheduling constraints). \\nThe airspace and associated procedures (i.e. PBN enabled Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STARs) or Instrument \\nApproach Procedures (IAPs)) also play a key role in the adaptation and in turn the operational success of the arrival \\nmanagement DST. This section provides an overview of the current and upcoming generation arrival management technologies along \\nwith the associated processes that are currently in place for adapting the tools and for creating the published arrival \\nprocedures. A. Arrival Management and Time Based Metering \\nAs previously indicated, in the United States, arrival management is being provided through the use of arrival time-based scheduling and management DSTs, which are enabled by the TBFM system. Time-based scheduling (aka. \\nmetering) of arrival flows is not a new concept in air traffic management. The original concept of metering goes \\nback to at least the mid 1970s with the development of the En Route Metering (ERM) program. The ERM program \\n(1970s-80s) was based on a simple concept of proactively spacing out the flights in en-route based on projected \\ndemand to avoid excessive holding and vectoring near the destination airport and was deployed as part of the en-route \\nautomation system. The second-generation metering tool was an evolution of the ERM system into the first national \\nmetering program called Arrival Sequencing Program (ASP) (1980s-90s) which started to introduce low fidelity \\naircraft trajectory prediction calculations as part of the scheduling. American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 4 The current generation TBFM system, which is based on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \\n(NASA) Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) system, is the third generation of time-based metering tools. TMA was \\na component of the CenterTRACON Automation System (CTAS), a suite of air traffic management tools developed \\nat NASA Ames Research Center [6]. The system was technology transferred to the Federal Aviation Administration \\n(FAA) and was first deployed in the early 2000s. The TMA system continued to expand and evolve. In 2003 the \\nAdjacent Center Metering (ACM) capability was developed which allowed multiple en-route systems to provide input \\nto TMA, effectively removing center boundaries for traffic management purposes. In 2006 the En-route departure \\n(EDC) capability was added which extended the metering concept to managing departures. By August 2007, TMA \\nwas deployed at all ARTCCs in the United States. TMA evolved into what is now called TBFM, which included a \\ncomplete re-architecture and modernization of the technology. Recent enhancements to TBFM include the addition of \\ncoupled and extended metering capabilities which increase the operational range of TBFM as well as meet time speed \\nadvisories which controllers can utilize to achieve TBFM generated schedules. In addition to the current generation TBFM technologies, there are currently plans to implement an emerging \\ntechnology that enhances TBFM, which is called the Terminal Sequencing and Spacing (TSAS) capability developed \\nby NASA [15]. TSAS enhances TBFM to apply time-based metering operations in the terminal environment with the \\nobjective of reducing tactical decision-making related to aircraft sequencing and spacing, and to enable mixed \\nequipage use of both curved-path PBN procedures (i.e., procedures that contain Radius to Fix (RF) legs) as well as \\nmore traditional PBN and RNAV procedures (i.e., procedures that only contain Track to Fix (TF) legs). TSAS achieves \\nthese objectives by providing terminal airspace merging and spacing tools that are used for time-based metering \\noperations. \\nFigure 1. Evolution of Arrival Management Decision Support Tools. \\n As indicated in Figure 1, with each evolution starting from the original ERM/ASP metering programs to current \\ngeneration TMA/TBFM technologies and moving towards planned next generation technologies [14], theres a shift \\nto more precise trajectory prediction and scheduling methodologies which in turn rely on increasing congruence \\nbetween the arrival management DST adaptation and published procedure conformance. Although this paper focuses on arrival management tools in the U.S. (i.e. TBFM) and its evolution under the Next \\nGeneration Air Transportation System (NextGen) program, prevalent use of arrival management technologies also \\nexists in Europe as well as emerging use in Asia. Unlike in the U.S., Europe has a variety of arrival management tools \\navailable with different levels of functionality [16]. However, some arrival management DSTs that are currently in \\noperation, such as the Means to Aid Expedition and Sequencing of Traffic with Research of Optimization \\n(MAESTRO) built by the French Centre d'Etudes de la Navigation Aerienne [8] and the Computer Oriented \\nMetering, Planning and Advisory System (COMPAS) build by German Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR) \\n[9], have a similar foundation and origin as the TMA/TBFM system first proposed by the NASA Ames Research \\nCenter [7]. Given that they are undergoing a similar evolution as TBFM under the umbrella European Single European \\nSky ATM Research (SESAR) [2] program, it is expected that many of the concepts and elements presented here could \\nbe translated to those systems as well. B. PBN Procedure Development \\nPerformance Based Navigation (PBN) comprises Area Navigation (RNAV) and Required Navigation Performance (RNP) and describes an aircrafts ability to navigate using performance standards. RNAV enables aircraft to fly on \\nany desired flight path within the coverage of ground or space-based navigation aids. RNP is RNAV with the addition \\nof an onboard performance monitoring and alerting capability. A defining characteristic of RNP operations is the \\nability of the aircraft navigation system to monitor the navigation performance it achieves and inform the crew if the \\nrequirement is not met during an operation. Based on the FAA PBN National Airspace System (NAS) Navigation \\nStrategy, by 2030, PBN procedures and flexible routing will be the standard method of navigation throughout the NAS \\nduring normal operating conditions. Utilization of PBN procedures is expected to be greatly enabled using advanced \\nDSTs that will need to be tightly integrated [4]. American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 5 The process for developing and implementing PBN procedures in the NAS is well-documented in the PBN \\nDevelopment \\nPreliminary Activities, Development Work, Operational Preparations, Implementation, and Post-Implementation \\nMonitoring and Evaluation [3]. \\nFigure 2. PBN Development & Implementation Process [3] The PBN Development & Implementation Process focuses on performing upfront work to determine whether the \\nproject should be undertaken including achieving consensus from the Regional Airspace & Procedures Team (RAPT) \\nprior to starting development. Following these preliminary activities, development and preparatory work is conducted \\nprior to implementation. Lastly, post-implementation analysis is performed to capture any implementation issues that \\narose and lessons learned for future projects. This process has been successfully applied to many PBN projects in \\nrecent years throughout the NAS. When following the PBN Development and Implementation processes, various tools are employed to support the \\nteams in executing their work. The primary tool for PBN procedure design is the FAAs capability called Terminal \\nArea Route Generation, Evaluation, and Traffic Simulation (TARGETS). TARGETS provides a common platform \\nthat enables procedure designers to leverage various navigation data sources to develop PBN procedures, evaluate \\nthose procedures against the latest FAA design criteria, and to evaluate the flyability of a design utilizing aircraft \\nperformance models. TARGETS also generates the required documentation required for operational preparations prior \\nto implementing the new or modified procedure. Depending upon the extent of the change to a PBN procedure or if the procedure is part of a larger redesign effort, \\nHuman-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations may be utilized to evaluate the procedures in various operational scenarios. \\nThese operational scenarios are evaluated in real-time with air traffic controllers to elicit feedback on the suitability \\nof the new operations. The HITL assessments lead to design refinements based on the perceived operational suitability, \\nmaking HITL simulations a critically important tool for larger PBN redesign projects where the impact of the design \\nchanges may not be well understood. C. TBFM Adaptation Process \\nIntegration of PBN procedure design and TBFM adapted metering design is considered critical to the implementation of TBO. The current PBN/TBFM system design and adaptation process can take several months and \\nthere are limited tools available to design teams to help with this process. Existing TBFM adaptation tools do not \\neffectively support concurrent visualization/modification of procedures and TBFM adaptation elements, or enable \\nassessment of the impact of proposed designs on flight operations. Compared to PBN, TBFM adaptation development and implementation processes are not as standardized or fully \\ndocumented. The TBFM system requires that facility adaptation be developed and maintained to ensure desired \\nperformance is achieved and that the adaptation is consistent with the local operations. The development and \\nmaintenance activities are performed when new procedures are implemented, existing procedures are changed, or \\nTBFM system performance changes are desired. The TBFM adaptation data consists of many hundreds of distinct \\nfiles which use a complex syntax to specify the TBFM adaptation elements defined in the TBFM Interface Control \\nDocument (ICD) [10]. Changes are made using careful configuration management practices and are applied on top of \\na baseline representing the current TBFM adaptation at a facility. The adaptation is modified manually by editing the \\nfile, or set of files, requiring a change to work with the operational TBFM system. Evaluation tools are used to analyze \\nadaptation files for syntax",
