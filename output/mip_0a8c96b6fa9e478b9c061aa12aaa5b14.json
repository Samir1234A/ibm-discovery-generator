Reuse is restricted. Contact the Contracts Management Office for \\nguidance. Practical and Actionable Cybersecurity Solutions for Securing Protected Health \\nInformation By Sue Wang and Zach Furness, The MITRE Corporation This article discusses how the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) develops practical \\nand usable cybersecurity guidance that can be adopted across industries, including the healthcare \\nsector. The NCCoE works across public-private partnerships to create National Institute of Standards \\nand Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 1800 Series practice guides that are focused on specific \\nindustry challenges that companies can adopt for use. Over the past decade, cyberattacks against industry and the government have continued to grow, \\ndespite increases in spending, advances in security products, and public awareness of the problem. \\nCybersecurity is not just a technical problemit is also complicated by a landscape of policy and \\nregulation mandates, business and operation needs, and human behavior. These complexities require \\napproaches that can bring together participants from across the public and private sectors to work on \\njoint solutions that can bridge these domains. The NCCoE was established in 2012 and is co-sponsored by NIST, the State of Maryland, and \\nMontgomery County to support trustworthiness in government and commercial sectors while also \\nworking to strengthen economic growth for Maryland and the nation. Its mission is to accelerate \\nadoption of secure technologies by collaborating with innovators to provide real-world, standards-based \\ncybersecurity capabilities.1 It does this by undertaking projects that include stakeholders from industry \\nalong with government and commercial security companies to develop reference solutions that are \\nfocused on cybersecurity challenges identified by industrial sectors. NCCoE Practice Guides NCCoE guidance is documented via NIST SP 1800 Series practice guides. These guides complement the \\nmore traditional and well-known NIST SP 800 Series IT security guidance, which has been adopted across \\nindustry and the federal government. Practice guides focus on the practical application of existing \\nstandards and guidance rather than create new standards. This is in line with a philosophy that most \\ncyberattacks can be prevented by using current standards and technology. What is lacking is a general \\nunderstanding of how to apply those capabilities against specific problems. NCCoE practice guides follow several core tenets: Standards-based. As mentioned above, practice guides focus on applying existing standards and \\ntechnology as opposed to creating new standards and technology. A key element of a guide is \\nmapping functions within the challenge problem to appropriate security controls such as those \\ndocumented in NIST 800-53, ISO/IEC (27001), and other relevant standards. The NIST https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/about-the-center/strategy 2 Cybersecurity Framework is used in each practice guide to map these controls.\\nModular. Practice guides provide a reference solution, which is one of many possible solutions that can be applied to a problem at hand. Functional elements of the solution, such as an \\nIntrusion Detection System, firewall, or Security Event and Information Management system, \\ncan be met by more than one commercial component. These solutions are modular, allowing \\nother security products to be substituted in place of the one used in the practice guide. Repeatable. Volume C of a practice guide contains all of the supporting documentation, such as \\nscreenshots and installation procedures, that one would need to replicate the work done in \\ndeveloping the reference solution. This allows an engineer or IT security integrator to \\nunderstand the details of the build that was done in the NCCoE labs. Commercially available. No custom software or hardware is employed in a practice guideall the \\ncomponents are commercially available. This helps promote the idea that a solution exists that \\ncan be readily implemented by an end user and that is based on existing technology. Usable. Creating the reference solution in the NCCoE labs helps ensure that the implementation \\nwill be usable. By employing the solution in the context of the intended problem, we can \\nunderstand how usable the solution is. Open and transparent. The overall process for practice guide development is open to anyone \\nfrom the industrial sector or product vendors who are interested in contributing to the solution. \\nPractice guides are freely available on the NCCoE website to anyone who wishes to integrate \\nthe guidance into his or her solutions. The figure below provides an overview of the practice guide development process. It begins by defining a \\ncybersecurity challengetypically brought forward based on discussions with industry organizations that \\nmake up one of our communities of interest (COI). The COI helps validate the problem and works with \\nNCCoE engineers to document a formal use case and project description. The project description is used \\nto solicit requests for interested organizations to participate in the projecttypically through a Federal \\nRegister Notice. Organizations that are selected to participate in the build provide technology necessary \\nto re-create the challenge problem within the NCCoE lab. The integration of those components results in \\na reference implementation that can serve as a guide to industry in addressing the original problem. \\nResults of the work are documented in a NIST SP 1800 Series practice guide and are freely shared with \\nindustry and government. 3 2 Nick Ismail, Is safeguarding data the rising challenge in the rapidly changing world of healthcare IT?, Information \\nAge (June 14, 2017) \\nhttp://www.information-age.com/safeguarding-data-challenge-healthcare-123466743/ \\n3 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights, Breach Portal \\nhttps://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf \\n4 Elizabeth Snell, Healthcare Hacking Leading Cause for 2017 Incidents, HealthITSecurity (June 6, 2017)\\nhttps://healthitsecurity.com/news/healthcare-hacking-leading-cause-for-2017-incidents \\n5 Ponemon Institute, 2017 Cost of Data Breach Studyhttps://www-\\n01.ibm.com/marketing/iwm/dre/signup?source=urx-15763&S_PKG=ov58441&S_VCPI=Search_Google-_-\\nSecurity_Optimize+the+Security+Program-_-WW_NA-_-ponemon+Institute_Exact_-\\n6 2017 HIMSS Cybersecurity Survey \\nhttp://www.himss.org/sites/himssorg/files/2017-HIMSS-Cybersecurity-Survey-Final-Report.pdf \\n7 Gavin OBrien, Sue Wang, Brett Pleasant, Kangmin Zheng, Nate Lesser, Colin Bowers, and Kyle Kamke, Securing Since its establishment, the NCCoE has published 11 practice guides that support industry and broad \\ntechnology areas. Solutions are derived either from problems in specific industries or from broad \\ntechnology challenges that are common to multiple sectors. While the sector-specific approaches are \\nprimarily focused on aspects relevant to that sector, it is possible to reuse a solution from one sector to \\nanother if the underlying challenges have much in common. For example, the core elements of an IT \\nasset management solution for the financial services sector could be reused in healthcare or energy \\nunder appropriate circumstances. NCCoE Healthcare Sector Projects Technology is the driving force behind modern healthcare and provides many benefits to patient care. \\nThe modern healthcare ecosystem presents challenges in protecting privacy of patient information due \\nto the rising number of security threats that lead to medical records, including patients personally \\nidentifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI), ending up in the wrong hands.2 According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights, Breach Portal, \\nhealthcare data breaches have continued to increase in recent years.3 Multiple studies show that the \\nlargest healthcare data breaches in 2017 were due to hacking. The rise in hacking incidents can be \\nexplained in part by the increase in ransomware attacks on healthcare providers in 2017, and data \\nbreach costs are the highest among surveyed sectors.4 The Ponemon Institutes study on the cost of data \\nbreaches estimates that data breaches could be costing the healthcare industry $6.2 billion. No \\nhealthcare organization, regardless of size, is immune from data breach.5 According to a 2017 Health \\nInformation and Management Systems Society Cybersecurity Survey report, patient safety and data \\nbreaches are the top two concerns among healthcare organizations.6 In the next sections, we highlight three of our applied cybersecurity projects in the healthcare space. \\nAlthough each project focuses on a different subdomain of healthcare, the common goal is to help \\nimprove the cybersecurity posture of healthcare organizations and the protection of PHI and PII. Securing Electronic Health Records on Mobile Devices\\nIn collaboration with community members and technology vendors, the NCCoE has developed a \\nreference solution for securing electronic health records (EHR) on mobile devices. The reference solution \\nis detailed in the NCCoEs Cybersecurity Practice Guide SP 1800-1, Securing Electronic Health Records on \\nMobile Devices.7 SP 1800-1 specifically shows how security engineers and IT professionals, using \\ncommercially available, open-source tools and technologies that are consistent with cybersecurity http://www.information-age.com/safeguarding-data-challenge-healthcare-123466743/\\nhttps://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf\\nhttps://healthitsecurity.com/news/healthcare-hacking-leading-cause-for-2017-incidents\\nhttps://www-01.ibm.com/marketing/iwm/dre/signup?source=urx-15763&S_PKG=ov58441&S_VCPI=Search_Google-_-Security_Optimize+the+Security+Program-_-WW_NA-_-ponemon+Institute_Exact_-\\nhttps://www-01.ibm.com/marketing/iwm/dre/signup?source=urx-15763&S_PKG=ov58441&S_VCPI=Search_Google-_-Security_Optimize+the+Security+Program-_-WW_NA-_-ponemon+Institute_Exact_-\\nhttps://www-01.ibm.com/marketing/iwm/dre/signup?source=urx-15763&S_PKG=ov58441&S_VCPI=Search_Google-_-Security_Optimize+the+Security+Program-_-WW_NA-_-ponemon+Institute_Exact_-\\nhttp://www.himss.org/sites/himssorg/files/2017-HIMSS-Cybersecurity-Survey-Final-Report.pdf 4 Electronic Health Records on Mobile Devices, NIST SP 1800-1 (July 2015) \\nhttps://www.nccoe.nist.gov/sites/default/files/library/sp1800/hit-ehr-nist-sp1800-1-draft.pdf standards, can help healthcare organizations share patients health records more securely on mobile \\ndevices. The guide uses a layered security strategy to achieve these results. Business Challenge Healthcare providers increasingly use mobile devices to store, process, and transmit patient information. \\nWhen health information is stolen, inappropriately made public, or altered, healthcare organizations can \\nface penalties and lose consumer trust, and patient care and safety may be compromised. Unfortunately, many organizations have not implemented safeguards to ensure the security of patient \\ndata when doctors, nurses, and other caregivers use mobile devices in conjunction with an EHR system. \\nThe absence of effective safeguards, in the face of a need to leverage mobile device technologies to \\nmore rapidly and effectively deliver healthcare, poses a significant business challenge to providers. Approaches and Solution The reference architecture for the secure exchange of electronic health records on mobile devices in a \\nhealthcare organization is shown",
