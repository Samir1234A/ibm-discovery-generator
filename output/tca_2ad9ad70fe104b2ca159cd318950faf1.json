This booklet \\ndocuments the many signifi cant outreach and collaboration \\nactions of MITRE staff in support of CAASDs mission: \\nserving the public interest by advancing the safety, security, \\neff ectiveness, and effi ciency of aviation in the United States \\nand around the world. This continues to be an exciting time for the aviation \\nand aerospace communities. Unmanned aircraft and \\ncommercial space vehicles are inspiring innovative new \\nbusiness opportunities, but bring new operational and \\ntechnical challenges in preserving the high level of safety \\nand effi ciency in todays system. New technologies, such \\nas autonomy, mobile computing, data analytics, machine \\nlearning, and advanced sensors, will play a part in this \\nevolving landscape, but also present research challenges. \\nAs the FAA deploys NextGen capabilities, which are \\nnow being widely used in daily air traffi c management \\noperations, new procedures and technologies off er airspace \\nusers opportunities for signifi cant operational improvement \\nand safety enhancement. This is a highly collaborative communityone which \\nrelies on the free exchange of ideas and full consideration \\nof all stakeholder viewpoints. In that spirit, CAASD \\nstaff publish and present extensively in order to share \\nour ideas, obtain community feedback, and understand \\nnew perspectives. The papers, patents, awards, and other \\ntechnical contributions documented here are testaments to \\nthe collaborative spirit of our staff . We also thrive on intellectual challenges and opportunities to \\ninnovate. Through analytic and human-in-the-loop simulation, \\nour staff bring future concepts and capabilities to life in our \\nlaboratories to explore the opportunities off ered by these \\nadvancements, but also to understand their associated risks. \\nSuch advancement requires signifi cant research, analysis, and \\nunderstanding. Our staff s spirit of innovation and passion for \\nadvancing system operations are evidenced here. In order to \\nensure that our innovations have impact we actively manage \\nthe transition of our research and technology to government, \\nindustry, and other community stakeholders. Also refl ected in these pages is our diversity. Our work \\nrequires a broad range of operational experience and technical \\ndepth. Our staff include engineers, scientists, economists, \\npilots, controllers, traffi c managers, former airline and military \\npersonnel, and more. They provide operational expertise in air \\ntraffi c control, traffi c fl ow management, and space operations, \\nand technical expertise in systems engineering, computer \\nscience, operations research, human factors, economics, \\ncommunications, navigation, surveillance, and other essential \\ndisciplines. We could not accomplish all that we do without \\nthis rich diversity of experience and thought. Our staff inspire us by envisioning innovative ideas for \\nfuture capabilities and by performing rigorous technical and \\noperational analysis to ensure the viability of those ideas. The \\ncontributions and achievements documented here highlight \\nthe critical role CAASD and other MITRE staff are playing \\nin making new ideas in aviation and aerospace operations a \\nreality.
