  "text": "aggressive advancement in the direction of the flanks as well as into the depths of the opposing force. To accomplish such tasks, formations and units were required to have high maneuverability, independence, and initiative in resolving combat assignments.[footnoteRef:63] [63: Ibid.] Most important of all, however, was the decision to create OMGs that could fulfill Ogarkovs developments, and Gareyev specifically mentioned the concept and its contents as follows: \\nThe main difference between former mobile groups and them [OMGs] was that not only tank armies and divisions were used, but also separate army corps with special organizations, specially created to act as operational maneuver groups, where tank, motorized rifle, artillery, and other units outfitted with the latest equipment, amphibious combat infantry vehicles and armored transports, and self-propelled artillery were combined into a single organism. For the first time, an airborne-assault regiment and army aviation were included in the make-up of these corps.[footnoteRef:64] [64: Ibid.] Gareyev added that OMGs were liquidated with the fall of the Soviet Union but that operational maneuver groups will obviously be used in some form or another in the future. The main priority in the entire system of military development remains the operational-strategic vector.[footnoteRef:65] Again, it is important for a Western analyst to know what Gareyev meant by a form, for without this understanding, the potential realization of the concept is not clear.[footnoteRef:66] Thus, it is possible that OMGs could even be developed for space operations in some form or another. [65: Ibid.] [66: For an explanation of a form, see Timothy Thomas, Russias Forms and Methods of Military Operations, Military Review, May/June 2018, pp. 30-37.] US Experts Jacob Kipp and David Glantz on Russian Operational Art \\nDr. Jacob Kipp was an analyst and then the director of the Foreign Military Studies Office at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in past years. He is the author of numerous papers on Russian strategy and operational art and has served as a long-time consultant on Russian military affairs for numerous Pentagon offices. Kipp defined operational art as the conduct of war at echelons above corps and on the scale of theater-strategic campaigns.[footnoteRef:67] The term came into use, he notes, due to the development of new weaponry that not only extended the breadth and depth of the battlefield, but fires increased lethality. These weapons caused havoc in the development and application of combined arms, and offered new opportunities for maneuver. This forced more dependence on a commanders intellect (instead of just eyeballing a situation), which reduced chance to a question of probability. Calculations became based on an assessment of the mission, theater terrain, the enemys force, ones own forces, and time. All of these circumstances had to be taken into account as operations became more complex.[footnoteRef:68] [67: Jacob W. Kipp, The Origins of Soviet Operational Art: 1917-1936, in Historical Perspectives of the Operational Art, Michael D. Krause and R. Cody Phillips, General Editors, Center of Military History, Washington DC, 2005, p. 213. ] [68: Ibid., pp. 219-220.] Kipp added that operational art was defined by Aleksandr A. Svechin in a series of lectures on strategy in 1923-1924. These lectures described operational art as the bridge between tactics and strategy. N. Varfolomeev, a deputy head of the Department of Strategy during Svechins time, noted that the operation, which had become the base for understanding operational art, was the totality of maneuvers and battles in a given sector of a theater of military action to achieve a common objective.[footnoteRef:69] It was this concept of maneuver that appeared to take center stage in many discussions. It seemed that the less developed a theater of war, the greater were the opportunities of employing maneuver forms of combat. Maneuver was meant to disorganize and demoralize an opponent.[footnoteRef:70] [69: Ibid., pp. 214-215.] [70: Ibid., p. 224.] Svechins era, Kipp notes, was the time that the study of past campaigns, current trends in weapons development, and force structure requirements coalesced around the concept of operational art.[footnoteRef:71] Svechin, for example, had formulated two competing posturesannihilation and attritionas issues regarding the relationship between operational art and future war paradigms. Thoughts focused on combining breakthrough and deep pursuit operations in the conduct of annihilation operations. In such operations logistics became of critical importance in the accomplishment of operational art.[footnoteRef:72] [71: Ibid., p. 229.] [72: Ibid., pp. 230-231.] Noted Soviet General V. K. Triandafillov became an important advocate of operational art as well. He laid out in theoretical detail the military context for successive deep operations. Success in such operations, in accordance with the imprint of operational art, required an effective command and control system that would coordinate the operations of several fronts and the establishment of realistic logistical norms. Another Soviet General of renown, M. N. Tukhachevsky, was another advocate of operational art, arguing that it required the complete militarization of the national economy.[footnoteRef:73] [73: Ibid., pp. 233-234.] David Glantz, author of the popular work Soviet Military Operational Art: In Pursuit of Deep Battle, noted that between 1932 and 1936 the Red Armys theoretical and practical work on operational art created a model of offensive combat that has endured to the present.[footnoteRef:74] This thought was supplemented with a focus on maneuvering due to the mechanization and motorization of ground forces. Operational maneuver was noted to be the organized shifting of distinct groups of forces during an operation to achieve a more favorable position with regards to an enemy in order to strike a blow against him or repel an enemy attack.[footnoteRef:75] Glantz went on to describe how the Soviet Union then incorporated the development of nuclear weapons into the maneuver concept. He quotes Colonel F. D. Sverdlov, a leading maneuver specialist in Russia, as the author behind the defining of the concept known as antinuclear maneuver, which is the withdrawing of subunits from under the possible blows of an enemy nuclear strike.[footnoteRef:76] [74: David M. Glantz, Soviet Operational Art since 1936: The Triumph of Maneuver War, in Historical Perspectives of the Operational Art, Michael D. Krause and R. Cody Phillips, General Editors, Center of Military History, Washington DC, 2005, p. 249. ] [75: Ibid., p. 269.] [76: Ibid., p. 271.] The Soviet Unions perilous political and economic situation in the early 1990s caused the military to switch to a concept dubbed defense sufficiency. This was a military strategy based on premeditated defense. But as the nation gradually improved and moved into the 21st century, the military began to discuss vertical maneuver and envelopment by air assault and the conduct of operational and tactical maneuver again.[footnoteRef:77] This has apparently led to the works in Military Thought discussed above in relation to operational art. [77: Ibid., p. 278.] Russian Use of Operational Art and Maneuver in Space\\nBased on the discussion above of operational art, several points stand out. Operational art is defined as the preparation and conduct of combined-arms, joint, and independent operations for large-strategic formations. The discussion indicated in several places that a principal element of the concept was the preparation of such operations in peacetime in order to be prepared for the initial period of war, a period now marked by increased speed due to the impact of advanced technology in the information age and its impact on the development of weaponry, reconnaissance assets, and frequency interference capabilities. Being in a superior position during the initial period of war clears the way for the use of operational art in space and helps ensure success.\\nOther important points are listed below. The initial sentence in each bullet is from the discussion above. It is followed by another sentence (from this author, in brackets) which is a conceptualization indicating how satellites and space would fit each concept:\\nManeuver, deep operations, breakthroughs, and integrated operations were listed several times each. [Deep operations could involve Russian strikes against satellites in space or against underwater cables or the use of SODCIT criteria. Satellites perform maneuver operations often to inspect other satellites or to perform other missions.]\\nIt was noted that the less developed a theater of war, the greater were the opportunities of employing maneuver forms of combat. [Space is underdeveloped at the moment, which indicates it could remain for some time as a place for maneuver.]\\nIt was argued that an effective command and control system was needed for operational art. [Russia has established such a system with its National Defense Management Center in Moscow.] \\nDavid Glantz wrote that operational maneuver was the organized shifting of distinct groups of forces during an operation to achieve a more favorable position with regards to an enemy in order to strike a blow against him or repel an enemy attack.[footnoteRef:78] [Moving satellites against other satellites to either strike a blow against them or to simply achieve a strategic position in a specific orbit, such as to conduct inspections of other satellites, relate to Glantzs thought.] [78: Glantz, p. 269.] The operational art department is concentrating its efforts on developing new, unconventional forms and methods of employing large strategic formations and groupings of forces in both large-scale and local wars, as well as in armed",
