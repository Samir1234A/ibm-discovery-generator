  "text": "approaches. Stakeholders and the APM Framework Patient Advocacy Groups can use the APM Framework to understand the context behind plan and benefit design so they can identify and communicate desirable elements and participate in decisions about how to design payment plans and delivery systems. Providers can use the APM Framework to appreciate the types of payment reforms underway, to achieve a better understanding of where they are situated, to begin to conceive of where they might like to end up, andmost importantlyto plan for the future. Plans can use the APM Framework to drive payment and contracting models and as an financial tool to track spending and the distribution of members/beneficiaries and providers. This is crucially important, because adopting a common classification scheme represents a first step toward the alignment of payment approaches. Purchasers can use the APM Framework to engage and educate their employees about the health insurance landscape and to share information for population-based plans, along with the safeguards and benefits that would motivate them toward enrolling in such plans. http://hcp-lan.org/workproducts/apm-whitepaper-addendum.pdf\\nhttp://hcp-lan.org/workproducts/apm-whitepaper-addendum.pdf Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2546. 33 Appendix A: Category 3 Incentive-at-Risk APMs Because MACRA and the LAN APM Framework share the goal of transitioning away from FFS and into APMs that achieve better outcomes at lower costs, comparisons between the two systems for designating APM advancement can illuminate alternative ways to effectively tether payment to value, and take better account of variation among providers. Given that CPC+ Track 1 was the only Advanced APM (by MACRA standards) that was not classified as a Category 3 or 4 in the original framework, the Advisory Group closely examined how it used payment to hold providers accountable for quality and cost. As a result of these discussions, the Advisory Group determined that payments in CPC+ Track 1 drive value in a manner that is functionally equivalent to shared-savings arrangements in Category 3A. The Advisory Group therefore decided to classify CPC+ Track 1 and other incentive-at-risk APMs in Category 3A. Incentive-at-risk APMs give providers the opportunity to share in a portion of the savings they generate as a direct result of meeting utilization targets. These APMs possess two important characteristics. First, utilization measures that provide very strong proxies for TCOC take the place of formal financial benchmarks. Second, incentive payments for performance on utilization measures are used to reallocate derived savings (if any) between payers and providers. Because incentive payments (as opposed to payments made through the FFS architecture) are at risk for utilization performance, incentive-at-risk APMs are classified in Category 3A (as opposed to Category 3B). These incentive-at-risk APMs are particularly appropriate for smaller practices and other situations in which upfront investment might be necessary to provide adequate resources for providers to undertake care transformation, and in which it is not ideal to hold providers directly accountable for meeting benchmarks based on TCOC. Primary care in the Medicare population involves a unique set of circumstances that make incentive-at- risk APMs effective vehicles for improving quality while decreasing costs. First, a greater proportion of TCOC for the Medicare population is driven by fewer categories of health care utilization. Emergency department usage and inpatient stays account for roughly 40% of TCOC in the Medicare population, while these categories account for only about 20-25% of TCOC in the population covered by commercial insurance. This means that inpatient utilization measures provide more robust proxies for TCOC with fewer utilization targets for practices to track and work to achieve. Primary care practices also have the capability to focus on and influence these measures to a much greater degree than some other cost drivers under an expansive TCOC benchmark. CPC+ practices may also improve utilization performance by partnering with value-oriented specialty providers who appropriately use tests and interventions. Primary care providers also tend to practice in small groups, and their patient panels are typically too small to manage the financial risk of outlier patients disproportionate impact on TCOC. Additionally, Medicares previous experience with its Comprehensive Primary Care Classic model suggested that although the formation of virtual groups achieved panel sizes large enough to mitigate this risk and allowed for cost accountability, pooling patients across providers in a region appeared to dampen the driving force for cost savings. This may have been attributable to the diffusion of responsibility among multiple practices within a virtual group. Additionally, behavioral economics research strongly supports the notion that receiving an uncertain amount of incentive payments after a period of performance Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2546. 34 would be less motivational than providing defined payments up front and reconciling them after the fact, because providers are more likely to be motivated by potential losses than potential gains.19 Track 1 of Medicares CPC+ model takes these unique factors into consideration in the design of a Category 3A arrangement that generates cost savings by tying incentive payments to reductions in utilization. In addition to payments made through Medicares standard fee schedule, primary care practices receive prospective care management fees (Category 2A), as well as prospective performance- based incentive payments (Category 2C). Fifty percent of the incentive payment is based on providers performance on two utilization measures inpatient hospitalization utilization per 1,000 attributed beneficiaries and emergency department utilization per 1,000 attributed beneficiaries which means providers are able to share in a significant proportion of Medicares savings from reduced hospital utilization as a result of improved care coordination or greater availability of office visits, telephone, or telemedicine consultation. Conversely, providers who perform poorly on these two utilization measures risk paying back Medicare some or all of the utilization portion of the incentive payment. Cumulatively, these payments and risk place CPC+ Track 1 in Category 3A. Figure 5 illustrates the expected payment implications in CPC+ Track 1, when a provider maintains utilization at average levels, reduces utilization significantly more than average, or increases utilization slightly more than average. \\n19 Please note: So long as incentive payments for performance on key utilization measures effectively create a shared-savings arrangement they will be classified in Category 3A, irrespective of whether they are made prospectively or retrospectively. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2546. 35 Figure 5: Impacts of Utilization on Payments in CPC+ Track 1 It is important to note that reducing utilization (especially hospital utilization) is not intrinsically indicative of increased value, as this could theoretically be achieved through reductions in necessary care. To avoid the unintended consequences of rewarding reductions in utilization alone in CPC+, CMS 1) requires practices to meet quality benchmarks applicable to their entire practice population (not limited to Medicare beneficiaries) before they can keep a utilization incentive payment; 2) actively monitors claims activity to detect potentially unwarranted reductions in utilization; and 3) employs contractual agreements with providers that include additional patient protections. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2546. 36 Just as with TCOC reduction incentives, these and other safeguards are essential for incentive-at-risk APMs that use utilization as a proxy for cost, in order to ensure providers either are incentivized to only reduce unnecessary care or achieve efficiencies and prevent avoidable hospitalization and emergency room visits through care coordination and access.
