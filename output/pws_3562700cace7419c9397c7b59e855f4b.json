  "text": "SCALE makes system development for new do- mains tractable in a manner that previous, more labor-intensive approaches are not. Other approaches to automated features ex- traction from free text include efforts for automated annotation described in [32], event detection for indexing as described in[21], and identifying cited facts and principles in legal text [29]. The argumentation-mining community has produced a num- ber of efforts addressing the task of identifying argumentation units from free text (see generally [20]). However, despite their central role in legal argumentation and justification, case features, including factors, are not argument units per se. Accordingly these techniques are not directly applicable to the task of identifying relevant case features. 8 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTUREWORK Computational techniques for explainable legal problem solving have existed for many years, but broad adoption of these techniques has been impeded by their requirement for manual case represen- tation. The rise of large-scale text analytics and machine learning promised a way to finesse this obstacle, but the limited explanatory capability to these approaches has limited their adoption in law where, for deep institutional reasons, decisions must be justified in terms of authoritative legal sources. This paper has described two approaches to exploiting the scala- bility of machine learning while retaining explanatory capability. An evaluation of the first approach, NFE, failed to establish signifi- cant improvement in decision accuracy from decision support in the form of highlighting of case text based on attention weights. This experiment doesnt conclusively establish that this approach cant be made to work, but it suggests the limits of explanation and justification based purely on text without explicit reference to legally-relevant concepts. This negative result motivated a second approach, SCALE (Semi-supervised Case Annotation for Legal Ex- planations), that exploits structural and semantic regularities in case corpora to identify textual patterns corresponding to annotations in a subset of cases. This approach obviates manual representation of any but a representative set of cases while at the same time enabling all of the more traditional techniques for explanation and justification. Our evaluation of SCALE used the statement of facts and con- tentions in each case as a proxy for actual case records, which may be both more complete and less orderly than the panels own summary. We anticipate applying the SCALE methodology to an administrative agency starting in the next few months, which will provide a more realistic evaluation of its ability to scale to actual agency decision making. This work was undertaken in the hope of developing a method- ology equally applicable to routine administrative adjudications in agencies throughout the world. We hope that it will provide a model for how to apply contemporary computational linguistics techniques to homogeneous case corpora to produce explainable decision prediction systems with a minimum of manual case anno- tation.
