  "text": "\\nfurther alert timing research is recommended to examine values that would ensure \\ninterventions can be successfully implemented before a safety limit is exceeded. Though not part of their training, controllers were also observed attempting to assist a \\ndeteriorating IM PA operation by modifying the speed of the IM Lead Aircraft to help \\nkeep the IM Trail Aircraft within the safety limits. This was at times successful and was \\nobserved in both monitor configurations. When acting as Separate 28L / 28R Monitors, \\nparticipants were observed to coordinate to make this happen. viii\\n Further discussion during the debrief suggested that the ability for controllers to manually \\nprovide speeds to assist the IM PA operation may ultimately depend on which position is \\nresponsible for providing separation. A dedicated Monitor controller or a Final Approach \\ncontroller could be responsible for IM PA, depending on the facility configuration. This \\ncontroller would likely have enough spare capacity to manually issue speeds to keep the \\nIM Trail Aircraft within the safety limits. However, with a Monitor controller / Local \\ncontroller override configuration such as that tested in the HITL, significant concerns \\nwere raised with the number of communications that could be required to manage \\ndeteriorating IM PA operations. A Tower controller especially noted that it would be \\nhighly undesirable or even dangerous for Monitor controllers to override the Local \\ncontroller at even a moderate level. Even if the IM PA and the FIM Equipment proves to \\nbe highly reliable in keeping the IM Trail Aircraft within the safety limits, the Monitor \\ncontrollers will still need frequency time to manage between-pair spacing. Manual PA speed control may not be possible, however, if a Final controller position is \\nresponsible for providing IM PA separation. Depending on the task loading and \\ncommunications bandwidth, a Final controller may simply not have enough spare \\ncapacity to issue speeds to resolve a deteriorating IM PA operation. There may only be \\ntime to break out an IM Trail Aircraft once a Caution Alert is triggered. In this case, the \\nusefulness of a Predictive Alert may be reduced and so only a Caution Alert would be \\nrequired. This suggests the need for at least some of the features may be dependent \\nupon the specifics of how a facility may choose to integrate IM PA into their operation \\nand which controller position would be responsible for providing separation. Though \\ncontrollers overall suggested they would be able and willing to provide speeds to keep \\nthe aircraft within the safety limits, the practical considerations with respect to \\nmanaging the required communications may make this highly challenging to implement. Finally, upon receiving a Predictive Alert, controllers were often observed to contact the IM Trail \\nAircraft to confirm the status of the operation. Though allowed to do this, participants were not \\ngiven specific guidance as to what to say. Controllers usually asked for verification their FIM \\nEquipment was functioning. They also sometimes advised that the Trail Aircraft had a speed \\novertake on the Lead Aircraft. No matter the query, the pseudopilots were instructed to \\ncommunicate to the controller that their equipment appeared to be functioning properly and \\nthat the operation seemed fine to them. Though appropriate for the HITL, these responses did \\nnot appear to be helpful to the controllers as they did not indicate the reason for the \\nPredicative Alert nor indicate whether it would transition to a Caution Alert. This controller finding was considered in a companion IM PA HITL that examined the current \\noperation from the flight deck perspective (Lewis, Bone, Mendolia, & Nguyen, 2019). The study \\nnoted that the FIM Equipment does not provide pilots a way to determine whether they are in \\nan overtake situation or whether they are close to the CSL or WSL. Pilot participants disagreed \\nthey would be able to verify a speed overtake on the lead if queried by ATC, with most citing the \\nlack of ground speed as the reason. In response, the authors recommend that flight crew display \\nfeatures continue to be developed to give relevant information to the crew about the progress \\nof the IM PA operation such that they can answer ATC queries. As this may or may not prove ix\\n sufficient depending on the nature of the controller query, further consideration is \\nrecommended for controller and pilot coordination actions and information transfer when the \\nIM PA operation appears likely to require a breakout. Lateral Monitoring and Alerting. The CSL and WSL were designed to accommodate some \\namount of normal aircraft crosstrack error from the approach path centerline. If either aircraft \\nexceeded that amount in either direction (left or right), then it was assumed PA separation \\nwould no longer be valid. To indicate to controllers when deviations exceeded the CSL and WSL \\nassumptions, Lateral Boundaries, and an associated Exceedance Warning based on current-day \\nNTZ alerting, were implemented and evaluated as display features. With respect to the Lateral Deviation scenarios, on average controller participants agreed their \\nworkload was acceptable across all display types and monitor configurations and that they were \\nconfident they could assess whether separation would be maintained between the IM Trail \\nAircraft and their Lead aircraft. They also on average agreed they could easily assess whether \\naircraft involved in a PA operation were operating within their Lateral Boundaries and the FMA \\ndisplay (versus STARS) appeared to aid in their Lateral Boundary assessment. Controllers on \\naverage suggested that advance notice of an impending exceedance of the lateral bounds would \\nhave been more helpful than essential, but noted during the discussion that a lateral predictive-\\ntype alert may only be practical on an FMA display. Current STARS display features such as PTL \\nlines and separation bats (cones) appeared to provide an immediate and salient visual cue \\nwhen aircraft ground tracks began to diverge from the approach course. With respect to the lateral Exceedance Warning (red LAT in data block line 0 and Lateral \\nBoundary Line color change), controllers agreed on average that it was noticeable enough such \\nthat they became aware of it without undue delay. They also agreed on average that they had \\nsufficient time and situational awareness to choose and execute appropriate corrective action \\nonce the Exceedance Warning occurred. Controllers responded (via a PTT click) to Lateral \\nBoundary crossings on average within 2.4 sec (SD=1.2) when working as a Combined Monitor, \\nand within approximately 2.1 seconds (SD=1.3) when working as Separate Monitors. These \\nresponse times did not appear to be affected by monitor configuration or display type. The \\naverages observed in the current HITL are less than the average 4.3 sec (SD=2.7) for qualified \\ncontroller response times observed in Cox, Yates, & Savage (2011). It is unclear from the report, \\nhowever, the degree to which the experimental conditions were similar. In comments and the debrief discussion, some controllers recommended that the Exceedance \\nWarning should be more salient in identifying the deviating aircraft than what was simulated. \\nSeveral controllers suggested changing the color of the entire data block instead of only \\ndisplaying the red LAT indicator in line 0. Controller comments also suggested that the line \\ncolor change was effective in indicating a boundary crossing; however, it did not clearly identify \\nthe deviating aircraft. During the debrief discussions, a suggestion was made to consider \\nchanging the color only of a line segment in proximity to the deviating aircraft. Overall, it appeared that given the appropriate tools and training, the IM PA lateral separation \\nmonitoring task appeared feasible and acceptable to controllers. Though the FMA display was \\nfound to significantly aid in the Lateral Boundary assessment, responses did not appear to x\\n suggest it should be a minimum requirement. And, as discussed earlier in this section, controller \\nresponses indicated that a Combined Monitor position may preclude timely communications \\nwith aircraft in the (highly unlikely) event of a simultaneous deviation of two or more aircraft. \\nFurther study is recommended to examine whether separate monitors may ultimately be \\nrequired to safely manage extreme off-nominal lateral deviation situations. IM PA Initiation Task and Tools7.2\\nThe second major HITL objective was to evaluate the IM PA initiation task, especially with \\nrespect to Partial IM Clearance procedures. The initial positioning of the aircraft in the arrival \\nstream was therefore assumed to have been accomplished at the start of each scenario, before \\nthe aircraft arrived in the participant controllers airspace. The HITL used RNAV routes to ensure \\nthat aircraft were delivered to the final approach courses in a consistent, reproducible manner. \\nThese procedures were developed for the HITL and are not currently in place at SFO. However, \\nthey may approximate procedures for a future metering environment. Aircraft were handed off to the final controller when they were on a modified base leg, \\napproximately 25 NM from the runway, with the desired initial spacing, and separated in \\naltitude by 1000 ft. The HITL assumed that a Feeder Controller had first informed the candidate \\nIM Trail Aircraft of the planned IM PA operation, providing the IM Clearance Type (IM PA) and \\nIM Lead Aircraft Flight Identification. Using the IM Spacing List and IM information in the \\ncandidate Trail",
