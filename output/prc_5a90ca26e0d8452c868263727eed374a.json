On-Demand Assessment of Air Traffic Impact of Blocking \\nAirspace Amal Srivastava, Tom St. Clair, Grant Pan\\nThe MITRE Corporation 7515 Colshire Ave\\nMcLean, VA, USA Abstract The Federal Aviation Administration often blocks strategically located airspace volumes to \\nensure safety during a variety of operations that are potentially hazardous to aircraft, such \\nas space launches. As the frequency of these operations increases, there is a growing need \\nto deepen collaboration and transparency between stakeholders regarding the use of \\nairspace. This collaboration can be supported by models and capabilities to quickly assess \\nthe impact of airspace closures, up to 12 months into the future. This paper presents a \\ntechnique to enable a what-if analysis capability coupled with a prediction model, \\nwhereby changes in airspace dimension, location, and activation time are reflected \\ninstantaneously as measures of projected impact. The technique can also be used for quick \\npost-operations analysis using historical traffic data and to develop air traffic impact \\nassessment capabilities accessible to a broad range of users outside of the air traffic \\ndomain. This research has three key components: developing a model to predict air traffic \\ndemand, modeling air traffic impact to the affected traffic, and reducing this information \\ninto a data structure that can support on-demand analysis. The focus of this paper is on new \\ntechniques to predict demand using a large set of historical track data and further encode \\nthese projections to support the quick assessment of the impact of blocking various \\nairspace volumes. Initial results show that the proposed data reduction scheme accurately \\nrepresented the traffic crossing an airspace and resulted in data size reduction by over \\n50%. The projection model performed well, the actual number of impacted flights were \\nwithin the estimated range approximately 80% of the time. Finally, the responsiveness of \\nthe web-based prototype developed to illustrate the concept demonstrated the models \\nability to support an on-demand assessment of the air traffic impact of blocking airspace. 2018 Cambridge University Press.

Demand for airspace access has been on the rise due to an increasing number of new \\nentrants such as space operators, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), and balloon operators. \\nTo manage operations that are potentially hazardous to aircraft, such as space launches in \\nthe National Airspace System (NAS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) may route \\nair traffic around strategically located blocked airspace to ensure operational safety. As the \\nfrequency of these activities increases, there is a growing need to increase collaboration \\nand transparency among stakeholders regarding airspace usage. A primary need to support \\nthis collaboration is the ability of all stakeholders to quickly assess the impact of planned \\noperations far in advance of the event, up to 12 months into the future. Different \\nstakeholders will have different uses for such a capability. A space operator may be able to \\nadjust the plan of launch and reentry operations to have minimal impact to the NAS, and an \\nFAA analyst may be able to quickly assess the impact of last-minute changes in the launch \\ntime. In fact, a prediction model coupled with a what-if analysis capability, in which \\nchanges in blocked airspace dimensions, location, and activation time are reflected \\ninstantaneously as a measure of projected impact, could be a key enabler of collaborative \\nand transparent airspace use among all stakeholders. This work has three key components: developing a model to predict air traffic impacted by \\nblocking airspace volumes, modeling air traffic impact on the affected traffic, and reducing \\nthis information to a data structure that can support on-demand analysis. The focus of this \\npaper is on new techniques to predict demand from a large set of historical track data and \\nfurther encode these projections into a data structure that can support the quick \\nassessment using a what-if analysis paradigm. The organization of this paper is as follows: Section II explores background on existing \\napproaches to predicting the air traffic impact of blocked airspace, Section III provides an \\noverview of the approach, and Section IV discusses the data sources underpinning the \\nimplemented algorithms and the scope of the study. Section V discusses the data reduction \\nand encoding scheme, Section VI describes the traffic projection model, and Section VII \\nsummarizes notes on the implementation of the model as a prototype. In conclusion, \\nSection VIII points out the strengths and weakness of this approach and future work. In this paper, the terms aircraft hazard areas (AHAs) and Special Use Areas (SUAs) are \\ncollectively referred to as blocked airspace; additionally, use of word the airspace \\nimplies airspace volumes having lateral as well as vertical dimensions. II. Background The primary focus of the research presented in this paper is enabling a what-if analysis \\ncapability that can provide immediate assessment of the impact of blocking airspace to a \\nbroad class of users with little expertise in the air traffic domain. To the best knowledge of 3 1 DART is a product of AvMet, information at http://www.avmet.com/dart\\n2 Fast-time simulation tool developed by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames. 3 Fast-time simulation tool developed by The MITRE Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD). the authors, no published research addresses this requirement. Tools such as Dynamic \\nAirspace Routing Tool (DART) 1can be used to assess the NAS impact of closing airspaces; \\nhowever, to do that requires access to the tool, operator knowledge of the air traffic \\ndomain, availability of data (such as traffic and weather), and setup time. The other component of the research is projecting the air traffic impact of blocking an \\narbitrary airspace, which is a complex task, as it varies significantly depending on factors \\nsuch as location, season, day of the week, time of day, and weather. In addition, the air \\ntraffic management strategies to avoid hazard areas vary depending on area control centers \\nand are not known in advance of the operation that requires blocking airspace. There are several publicly available demand forecasts. FAA publishes the Terminal Area \\nForecast (TAF) for active airports in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems \\n(NPIAS), which is considered the de facto official aviation forecast. It is developed from a \\nseries of airport models that use trends in demographics to forecast changes in \\nenplanement. Boeing publishes its latest assessment of the 20-year demand for world travel \\nin its Current Market Outlook (Boeing, 2017), and Airbus provides its projection of 20-year \\ndemand in its Global Market Forecast (Airbus, 2017). Finally, the Transportation Systems \\nAnalysis Model (TSAM) (Jeff Viken, 2006; Jeff Viken, 2006) developed by Virginia Techs Air \\nTransportation Systems Lab and NASA Langley can be used to project the passenger \\ndemand for trips more than 100 miles selecting among three modes of transport: \\nautomobile, airline, and on-demand services using very light jet aircraft. All these forecasts \\nfocus on demand growth at the airports, not in the airspace in between; that is, they do not \\nprovide a prediction of trajectories of fights between the origin and destination airports. \\nThis makes them insufficient for modeling the impact of blocked airspace. \\nOne approach to assessing the impact of a launch or reentry operation is to model the traffic \\non the launch day based on available traffic and weather forecasts, and calculate the \\nexpected delay by simulating the rerouting of the affected flights around the AHAs using \\ntools such as Future ATM Concepts Evaluation Tool (FACET)2 and systemwideModeler 3. \\nThis approach requires significant effort from a well-informed operator in setting up the \\nsimulation to realistically model the planned operation conditions, making it unsuitable for \\nuse in a what-if analysis capability that can be used by a broad range of users with no \\nknowledge of the air traffic domain. Another approach used by Jessica Lee and Marie Kee (Kee, January, 2014) involves \\nstatistical analysis on a specific SpaceX Falcon9 launch vehicle/Dragon capsule reentry \\nvehicle operation to determine if the operation caused flights to experience significantly \\nlonger flight distances, more fuel burned, and longer flight durations as compared to similar \\nflights on other days. The paths of the flights on the launch day were compared to the \\nsimilar flights on a set of five historical days to arrive at a range of distance and time \\nimpacts of the launch. This approach may be used to develop prediction models of the \\nlaunches with similar characteristics, such as the location and geometry of the hazard areas, 4 block time window, and the day of the week of the operation. However, its use as a general-\\npurpose method to assess the impact of any blocked airspace is limited. Since this approach \\nis derived from a comparison to actual impacts, a large number of historical impacted days would \\nbe required before such an approach can be used to estimate behavior for future events. Also, the \\nstudy required significant human effort and is not amenable to automation and producing \\nresults in a short time. In related research, Srivastava (Amal Srivastava, 2015) projected the NAS impact of \\nblocking airspace by measuring",
