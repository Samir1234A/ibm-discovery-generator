Towards that end this paper examines four variations of the general combinatoric decision making problem of identifying the physical nodes of a computer network to enter, the physical nodes to traverse and then the functional nodes to attack to most impact the networks mission all subject to a budget constraint. The paper also introduces a new model to begin to lay the groundwork for computing the trade-offs between observ- ing an adversarys traffic vs. diminishing an adversarys functionality. To capture this scenario, this paper proposes interlocking a Prize Collecting Steiner Tree problem with Functional Analysis. The paper ends with nu- merical experiments which illustrate by example, the size and complexity of networks each of the four variations are achievable using the methods described. This work is meant to provide initial support for future defense analysis evaluating attack strategies relying on imperfect information, and incorporating network properties into Functional Analysis. c Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 17-3756 1 1 Introduction Modeling cyber security attack metrics with a functional network is a practiced and natural means to capture complex relationships towards overall operability. However, physical realities can easily be missed with this modeling technique. This paper proposes a broad means to improving functional analysis through the inclusion of decisions support from physical network models. Functional rela- tionships determine the quality of an overall system given many pieces, and can be used to identify nodes of greatest impact to an attacker. Physical relation- ships express the realities of any attack, that an attack is a strategy occurring over real world connections where there may be the ability to share costs among many attacks, and since attacks are part of a larger system, may adversely im- pact other goals on a network. This papers examines four variations of this variety: (P1) A network with physical nodes which can be attacked and a very simple mission objective. (P2) A network with no physical nodes but functional nodes whose leafs, when attacked, impact the mission objective in specified but more complicated ways. (P3) A network with both physical and functional nodes which combines the best elements of problem (P1) and problem (P2). (P4) A network with both physical and functional nodes as is in (P3) but also with nodes which have the ability to observe traffic. The problems (P1)-(P3) are used to explore the initial computational com- plexity of such a problems as (P3). This work is precursor to analysis defensive network design analysis and providing a tool for evaluating impartial informa- tion attacking methods. The problem (P4) is introduced to explore how network properties feed into functional analysis, and not just what nodes are attacked. As a generic description, systems working towards a common function can be said to have a mission, where the combined elements of the system have an overall capability of effectiveness at accomplishing that function. The quality of this capability to accomplish the desired function can be called the Measure of Effectiveness (MOE), a continuous rating between 0 and 1, where 0 is no function and 1 is fully functional. The inputs that can be changed, or in this paper, attacked, are called the leaf nodes, denoted i L. The premise is that the nodes i L have a effectiveness value ei which propagate through a function system to find the MOE. There are many ways in which the MOE can be defined, any calculable func- tion given inputs could suffice. For general use in this paper, given decisions w [0,1]|w| the MOE can be measured by w : moe(w) [0,1]. The func- tion moename() can be any suitable function with the given description name. For this paper w represents the leaf nodes attacked within a functional system, and the computations are run with an existing implementation of Functional 2 Network Dependency Analysis (FDNA) [3, 4, 5, 6, 16]. Functional system with parameterized inputs helps identify critical leaf nodes, i.e. if leaf nodes are attack which ones have the greatest impact to the MOE. Other functional net- works, such as BLARE, Crown Jewel, RiskMap, and SODA, can easily supplant FDNA in the analysis. Functional systems use parameters to model the relationship between child and parent nodes, to calculate the operability of nodes from the leaf nodes up to the root node. These parameters may be thought of as judgments on the relationships between nodes. If these parameters are either not accurate, or changed, it may impact any analysis. This uncertainty can be explored through robust optimization techniques that explore the worst case modifications of these parameters [9]. This paper will take advantage of existing uncertainty work on FDNA trees to get these considerations without additional effort. This paper extends functional networks by accounting for more complex restrictions on the decisions that can be made. In particular, the focus is on incorporating physical realities of computer network attacks into decision tree analysis. Instead of each leaf node of the functional network having a set cost, attacks will occur over a new physical network where leaf nodes of the functional network double as physical nodes. This will allow attacks to share attacking resources for multiple attacks, simultaneously. This is an implementation of Prize Collecting Steiner Tree (PCST) to an objective value using more complex functions. The expansion of functional networks is done by adding in a physical layer. Steiner Tree networks are well studied and come in a wide variety [12]. Most variations of the problem have fairly straight forward objective functions, but a very broad class of objectives is being proposed in this paper. In some ways, Prize Collecting Steiner Tree (PCST) objectives, which involves finding a min- imum cost subtree with costs for including edges and a profits for connecting specified sets of nodes, is close to the base problem in this paper [13]. There are some variations with more complex objective functions. Buy at Bulk k-Steiner Tree is a problem that incorporates a distance measure between node pairs into the objective [14]. In communication networks, evaluating the quality of edges can be additional constraints to a problem such as in Quality of Service Mul- ticast Tree Problem. [15] This paper contributes a general functional analysis structure as an objective to the Steiner Class of problems and loosely uses PCST to define a variation with a budget for opening arcs and a desirable prize for reaching non-Steiner nodes. The sets of problems which will be discussed in this paper will start from base problems (P1) and (P2), then combine them. This paper keeps an FDNA MOE obfuscated with moeopr(w) for the purpose of describing expansions of the problem and emphasizing this is not restricted to FDNA. This function measures the operability of a network, which an attacker wants to minimize. A formal description of FDNA can be found in Appendix A. Finally, the addition of complimentary second objective to the attacker is added to reference further work, which is described in the appendix. 3 (P1) Physical Attack Attackers start from outside a protected network or networks, and spend budget to traverse arcs and compromise successive nodes, trying to min- imize the average operability of important nodes. The attacker is tar- geting a specific set of important nodes, but the resource costs to make the attacks is determined by actual network artifacts, such as strength of firewalls, etc. Finding weaker points of traversal and taking advantage of already compromised paths can be advantageous to the attacker. This can be used as a simple measure of effectiveness of attacks or placing network traffic observers. (P2) Functional Attack The attacker makes decisions to compromise the leaf nodes of a functional network, indicated by w, to minimize the mission, moeopr(w), while not exceeding a cost budget. The cost to attack is determined independently for every leaf node, and the sum cost of attacking each leaf node must be within the resource budget. Each of the leaf nodes of a network are represented by high and low operability values and a cost to attack. Each attack reduces the operability of a leaf node from the high value to the low value, and the budget is used to minimize the MOE by selecting the appropriate leaf nodes to attack. (P3) Functional Physical Attack Combine (P1) and (P2), by replacing the simple MOE of (P1) with the more diverse computation of (P2). (P4) Functional Physical Attack with Observation This is (P3) with two additional considerations. First a second objective is trying to maximize moeobs(m), where m represents the indicator of net- work traffic being observed in the modified, attacked network. Traffic is observed by in place observers the attacker already controls. The second change is that the attacker must now choose whether to disable a",
