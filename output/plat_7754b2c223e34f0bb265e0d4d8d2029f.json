  "text": "Delivers UAL21 to MF (MPORT) at 19:58:42 (a) Original Route (b) Weather-Free Route by AFST Figure 5. UAL21 Original Route vs Weather-Free Route by AFST C. Summary In this experiment, we simulated an integrated operation of \\nTBFM and AFST using the proposed platform. The operational \\nscenario demonstrated that following the AFST rerouting of \\nflights meant that weather had little impact on the stability of the \\nmetering schedule, i.e., most STAs to the MFs could be met \\nwithin an acceptable level of conformance. In follow-on research we plan to use this simulation platform \\nand expand the analysis to additional operational scenarios to \\nbetter understand the ability and also the limitation of AFST \\nfinding usable reroutes around/through weather. If too few \\nreroutes are found, then flights may make unplanned deviations \\naround weather, TBFM and TAAM ETAs will be out of sync, \\nassigned STAs will not be unachievable, and metering will be \\nineffective and turned off. On the other hand, if a sufficient \\nproportion, say 90% of weather-blocked flights2 receive viable \\nreroutes, then benefits of keeping TBFM active can be achieved. \\nOf course, in real-world application, a traffic manager may see \\nreroute opportunities which the AFST algorithm does not \\nidentify. In the posited scenario, positive benefits will accrue via the \\nimproved efficiency of metering, compared to MITs. Also of \\npositive benefit, reroutes may likely reduce tactical ATC \\nmaneuvers, implying reduced controller workload in the adverse \\nconditions of severe en route weather. VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS We have built a flexible, distributed simulation platform for \\nfacilitating TFM integration studies. The platform allows \\nrealistic prototypes of proposed or fielded TFM capabilities to \\ninteract with each other and influence simulated air traffic. A \\ndedicated air traffic simulator played the role of advancing \\nflights in time and space and of evaluating the actions derived \\nfrom the TFM capabilities. This addressed the need of using \\nadvanced TFM capabilities for conducting integration studies or \\nquantifying benefits. Such a simulation platform can not only support simulating \\nTFM interactions but also promote the reuse and interoperability \\nof the existing prototypes or modeling capabilities the plug-\\nand-play facility of the platform eliminates the need for the ad \\nhoc design of each new study. An initial experiment simulated AFST and TBFM under \\nconditions of severe en route weather. AFST demonstrated an \\nability to construct viable weather-avoidance reroutes. When \\nthese reroutes were implemented prior to the FH, metering \\ngenerated achievable STAs. Future work will investigate the \\nsuccess rate of AFST constructing reroutes. \\n2 Subject Matter Experts at MITRE CAASD have suggested that if more than about 10% of the metered flights cant meet their STAs, then metering would be deactivated.
