  "sdl_extracted_summary": "conflicts.[footnoteRef:79] [The use of satellites as an operational maneuver group would be an unconventional form of using such assets.] [79: Stolyarov.] The basis of both operational and tactical maneuver, according to Frunze, was attacks against the weakest points (the enemy flanks and rear) and the envelopment and outflanking of enemy groupings combined with attacks from the front.[footnoteRef:80] [Russian leaders state that they consider the weakest links in Western systems to be their links to space systems, which can be considered a flank.] [80: M. V. Frunze, p. 204.] Ground maneuvers proposed an aggressive advancement in the direction of the flanks as well as into the depths of the opposing force.[footnoteRef:81] [Space may now be considered a flank for planetary operations.] [81: The Living Embodiment] Operational maneuver groups will obviously be used in some form or another in the future.[footnoteRef:82] [Space assets that maneuver in the form of groups can involve the movement of space assets to assist in enveloping an opponent.] [82: The Living Embodiment] The majority of these operations are present in the planning of aerospace operations today. It was noted earlier that two important military leaders (Gareyev in 2011 and Shoygu in 2015) have stated that aerospace is the new center of gravity. A short summary of how Russias military is discussing concepts related to operational art in space, from a few sources, is summarized below.\\nIn 2009 a report noted that in the future a space strike echelon will accomplish combat missions and carry out combat support of land-based operations. The information-strike operation and a space operation are the result of the change in the nature of armed combat. They will precede air, naval, and land offensive operations. The information-strike operation was defined as \\nan automated weapons system, which is designed for the highly effective destruction of one, several, or many facilities (targets) using precision-guided strike weapons at great distances in accordance with the operations (combat operations, battle, strike, or engagement) plan or its concept of operations.[footnoteRef:83] [83: Igor Vitalyevich Morozov, Sergey Valentinovich Baushev, and Oleg Eduardovich Kaminskiy, Space and the Nature of Contemporary Operations: Gaining and Maintaining Supremacy in the Information and Space Sphere Has a Decisive Impact on the Course and Outcome of a Contemporary High-Tech Armed Confrontation, Vozdushino-Kosmicheskaya Oborona (Air-Space Defense), 14 July 2009, pages unknown.] Targets of an information-strike operation include the command and control posts and communication centers of combined formations and formations, aircraft, the missile troops and artillery, reconnaissance-strike (weapon) complexes, reconnaissance, air defense and electronic warfare.[footnoteRef:84] The reconnaissance-strike complex was defined as an automated weapon complex designed for the destruction of ground-based facilities using missiles, aircraft, and other forces immediately upon detection.[footnoteRef:85] [84: Ibid.] [85: Ibid.] In 2011, Gareyev, writing in the Journal of the Academy of Military Science, noted that the center of gravity of armed struggle is shifting to the aerospace domain, elements of which are increasingly more interconnected. An aerospace defense (VKO) campaign, Gareyev writes, would consist of a series of air operations. They would include bomb, rocket, radio-electronic and other strikes against an adversarys aviation, rocket and naval forces, air defense systems, command posts, industrial, energy, and other important infrastructure objectives and, finally, against the main ground force groupings. This is planned at the very beginning of a war.[footnoteRef:86] [86: M. A. Gareyev, On the Organization of the Russian Federations Aerospace Defense, Journal of the Academy of Military Science, No. 2 2011, p. 40.] Thwarting an opponents aerospace attack is of primary significance, since the course and outcome of a war depend on this. Such defensive conditions extend into the space domain. VKO missions include reconnaissance of the aerospace domain (an aerospace theater of military operations can be under consideration) to identify enemy attacks; the implementation of an antisatellite struggle; control over the space domain; and defense against strikes from space as well as an anti-rocket and air defense plan that confronts both strategic and nonstrategic attacks. These are dynamic operations that are acquiring greater importance.[footnoteRef:87] [87: Ibid.] Gareyev noted that a probable adversarys command and control system, to include aerospace attack means, is usually located in space. It thus becomes a primary target, where it is necessary\\nTo direct the main scientific and technological efforts towards seeking out the resources and methods aimed at bringing down the entire space communications and command and control system. This will not only create favorable conditions to successfully resolve VKO tasks, but also violate the principal base on which the opposing side structures its entire network-centric system of command and control.[footnoteRef:88] [88: Ibid., p. 42.] Such a system requires the creation of an operational group of specialists from the Main Air Force Staff, the Space Force Command, and other command and control organs in the General Staff Military Academy for the assessment of the actual conditions of forces and means.[footnoteRef:89] [89: Ibid.] In October 2013 Russia published its latest, at the time of this writing, military doctrine. It was noted that two principal tasks of the Armed Forces were to provide air and space defense of important structure of the Russian Federation while being ready to repel strikes from aerospace attacks; and to deploy and maintain in the strategic space zone orbital spacecraft groupings that support Armed Forces activities.[footnoteRef:90] Whether these groupings were OMGs is not known, but again the possibility remains. [90: B. D. Kazakhov and G. K. Isaev, Recommendations to Clarify the Conceptual Apparatus Used to Describe the Subject Area Tactics as a Component of Military Science, Vestnik Akademii Voenykh nauk (Journal of the Academy of Military Science), No. 3 2018, pp. 30-35] In November 2017 Russia announced it was developing two advanced anti-satellite weapons: Rudolf, a mobile anti-satellite strike system and the Tirada-2S, a mobile anti-communication satellite electronic warfare system.[footnoteRef:91] The Tirada-2S conducts the radio-electronic suppression of satellite communications, even from Earth.[footnoteRef:92] [91: No author or title provided, Interfax, 30 November 2017.] [92: No author or title provided, Interfax (in English), 9 January 2019.] In 2017, journalists reported on the use of Russias Space troops to test a maneuvering military inspection satellite. The satellite undocked from a Kosmos-2519 space platform and it began an autonomous flight. It first changed its orbit, then returned to the Kosmos platform and inspected it. Such a capability can allow for determining the functional purpose of a foreign satellite and, when required, turn into a space interceptor than can deploy missiles. Independent military expert Valeriy Mukhin stated that such a system can become a deterrence factor for potential enemies, as it can check whether a satellites stated function corresponds to reality.[footnoteRef:93] [93: S. Valchenko, N. Surov, and A. Ramm, Russia Sends Inspector into Orbit: Military Test Operations of Maneuvering Identification and Intercept Satellite, Izvestiya Online, 26 October 2017.] In 2018 a Wired magazine article discussed the threat of a war high above the earth among satellites. The article stated that in 2014 the US military noted that a piece of Russian space junk, Object 2014-28E, began to act strangely. It performed complicated maneuvers and came alive. It sided up to American commercial communication satellites. The Object has been joined in years since by similar space objects of Russian provenance.[footnoteRef:94] The same year a MiG-31 appeared on the Internet with a mockup of a new type (not identified further) of an anti-satellite missile under the fuselage. It would be guided to its target by the Krona space object recognition station at Kazakhstans Saryshagan range.[footnoteRef:95] Further, the Peresvet combat laser system was advertised as capable of fighting satellites in orbit according to the Russian Defense Ministry, and it has been supplied to the Space Forces.[footnoteRef:96] [94: Garrett M. Graff, The Outer Limits of War, Wired Magazine, July 2018, pp. 48-49.] [95: Anton Valagin, Photos: MiG-31 Tests Satellite Killer, Rossiyskaya Gazeta Online, 30 September 2018.] [96: No author or title provided, Interfax (in English), 5 December 2018.] Another 2018 report noted that a Soyuz-2 launch vehicle fitted with a Fregat upper stage can put into orbit up to 15 inspector satellites. Foreign media, it noted, had dubbed these inspector satellites to be killer satellites. Russian media reported that a Kosmos-2521 inspector satellite had shifted position after some months in orbit to draw close to and photograph various foreign satellites, American ones included. The article then noted that preparations to repulse a possible attack utilizing the capabilities of an orbital satellite grouping are under way in all the worlds leading states both in space and on Earth.[footnoteRef:97] These vehicles can spend years in space and, on command, instantly mount an attack due to an adversarys aggression. On Earth, techniques are under investigation to suppress satellite signals and create interference.[footnoteRef:98] [97: Irina Dronina, The Militarization of Space Threatens Undesirable Consequences for Everyone. A Single Medium-Class Launch Vehicle Can Put 15 Special-Purpose Satellites into Space, Nezavisimaya Gazeta Online, 19 June 2018.] [98: Ibid.] A final 2018 report listed the essence and content of the employment of tactical formations that are organizationally part of the space forces.

  "text": "the FAA and the aviation community to develop the operational concepts and procedures and the requirements for these Data Comm capabilities. We also performed operational testing to help ensure the successful integration and use of data communications throughout U.S. airspace. In 2016, the FAA provided Data Comm capabilities for use at 56 airports across the country. This has already resulted in shorter communication times, faster taxi-outs, and reduced delays. By the end of 2018, as many as 2,400 aircraft will be equipped with Data Comm capabilities. In 2019, the FAA plans to implement Data Comm services in its high-altitude air traffic control centers, extending the advantages of these services even further. n 12 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t 2,400 \\naircraft will be equipped with \\nData Comm Capabilities by 2018 13T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n 14 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t Tapping the Potential of \\nNew Space Capabilities 1,100 active satellites are currently orbiting Earth Constellations of commercial satellites are imaging Earth with increasing frequency and accuracy. Theyre providing content for \\nnavigation systems, business analytics, and global economics. This has led to a New Space vision: diverse commercial satellite imagery and analysis as low-cost commodities available to all. Multiple government agencies are seeking to tap the potential of New Space. The possibilities are far-reaching: mission planning, reconnaissance operations, disaster relief, resource conservation, and transportation security. MITRE is playing a vital role in helping the government take advantage of this emerging markets promise. MITRE is providing technical modeling and analysis to help government sponsors decide how and when to incorporate commercial space into their overall missions, investments, and acquisition strategies. We are also developing mission-driven analytics to add mission value from commercial offerings. Were piloting these in operational prototypes to address novel applications for our nations most challenging problems. n 15T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n Combating the Growing \\nThreat to Our Space Assets AFSPC, MITRE, Aerospace Corp., Lincoln Lab, and RAND helped create a Space Enterprise Vision Today, the United States must be prepared for attacks on our national security space systems as they travel through space. \\nChinas recent demonstrations of anti-satellite weapons are the most visible examples of the emerging threats to our space assets. In response, the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) asked for MITREs help in creating a Space Enterprise Vision (SEV) outlining how the military should address the increasing dangers to communications, navigation, and other space-based capabilities. The AFSPC brought together a team of FFRDCs to support that effort, asking MITRE to serve as co-lead. In October 2016, the team delivered the SEV to AFSPC, and it quickly gained acceptance across senior levels of the DoD and intelligence community. The SEV is now being used to guide planning choices, resource decisions, and requirements development across the DoD and the intelligence community. n 16 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t Space assets \\ninclude communications, \\nnavigation, surveillance, \\nmeteorological sensing, and \\nthreat detection 17T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n 18 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t Transforming Indonesias \\nAviation System In 2015, Indonesia launched an effort to modernize all aspects of its civil aviation operations. The International Air Transport \\nAssociation (IATA) predicts that Indonesia will become one of the worlds 10 largest passenger markets by 2020 and the fifth largest domestic market by 2034. Indonesias modernization program will therefore have long-term benefits. The initiativeknown as Indonesia Modernization of Air Navigation Services (IMANS)calls for developing new operations concepts, implementing advanced air traffic management systems, updating procedures, and better integrating Indonesias operations with those of other nations in the region. Starting in November 2015, MITRE worked with AirNav Indonesiathe countrys air navigation service providerto expedite the identification and deployment of the capabilities needed to fulfill the IMANS vision. In September 2016, MITRE provided a comprehensive concept of operations for the modernization effort. n IATA predicts that Indonesia will become one of the worlds 10 largest passenger markets by 2020 MITREs work in the Asia Pacific region is helping deliver harmonized aviation \\nsolutions 19T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n Judicial Analytics \\nCreates Cost Savings Under the federal district courts Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) system, all pending civil cases of a similar type are transferred to a single judge. \\nIn some MDLs, a court can receive upward of 6,000 new filings each day and face a backlog of up to 80,000 pending complaints. To better manage its own cases, one MDL court sought to capture pertinent items of data from each pending case file. This effort, the Office of the Clerk determined, would require 14 new staff, take four months to complete, and cost $400,000. The challenge was that the case documents are processed as PDF files, a format from which most automated systems cannot reliably retrieve specific data. Thats where MITREs expertise and independent status came in. After one week, nearly 95 percent of the desired data was compiled, eliminating the need for the costly solution the MDL court had originally anticipated. n A court can \\nreceive upward of \\n6,000 new filings each day 20 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t 21T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n 22 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t In 2015, almost 300 million \\nrecords were leaked, \\nand more than $1 billion \\nwas stolen worldwide by cyber hackers Protecting Taxpayer \\nIdentities Get Transcript enables users to obtain their tax transcripts online As Americans increasingly rely on the Internet for their business transactions, the amount of personal information accessible online \\nhas grown substantially, making it vulnerable to hacking. Many users business transactions require copies of their tax returns. The IRS therefore offers a service, Get Transcript, to enable users to quickly obtain copies of their tax transcripts online. This past year, when the IRS was strengthening the security features of the Get Transcript application, it called on MITRE to evaluate the systems security to assess its readiness for deployment. MITREs cybersecurity experts tested all components of the Get Transcript system as well as its supporting eAuthentication service, which verifies the users identity, and identified a few areas for improvement. In particular, we recommended the use of the latest multi- factor authentication techniques to prevent unauthorized access. The IRS acted on MITREs independent recommendations, thus providing greater protections for taxpayer data. Taxpayers everywhere are the beneficiaries of the IRSs and MITREs diligence. n 23T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n Analyzing Social Media to \\nPrevent Terrorist Attacks In December 2015, homegrown extremists inspired by a foreign terrorist group killed 14 people and injured 22 others in an attack in San Bernardino, California. How were they inspired? \\nVia social media and the Internet. To help prevent such attacks both at home and abroad, the federal government immediately created a team to examine how social media analytics could be applied to the screening and vetting of individuals traveling or seeking immigration benefits. The team included personnel from DHS, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the MITRE-operated Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute (HSSEDITM) FFRDC. The team members used their knowledge of media, international social media sites, and language processing to review open source and social media analytic capabilities and technologies. Ultimately, they evaluated more than 270 social media tools for their potential for addressing critical mission areas. They highlighted solutions for accessing some 30 social media platforms on the Internet and darknets, using data sets in more than 120 languages. They also discovered problems with existing analytic capabilities, which were quickly improved for government agencies use. The teams work is now serving as the national testbed for establishing the DHS Social Media Center. Their work also helped DHS improve its capabilities, achieve operational efficiencies, and lower costs through the automation of advanced analytics, thereby advancing the agencys overall goals. n Facebook has over 1.7 billion active users 24 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t 25T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n 26 M I",
