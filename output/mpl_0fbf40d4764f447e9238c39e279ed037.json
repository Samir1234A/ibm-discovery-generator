When creating a new program, the drafting and signature review of regulatory and statutory documentation to support the milestone review process is a major schedule driver. Each documents content contains a significant amount of common information and a small set of information of interest only to the applicable community (contracts, systems engineering, test, cybersecurity, etc.). Based on experience creating the Rapid Technology Insertion (RTI) process, it seems possible that using database and workflow methods for statutory and regulatory documents can dramatically accelerate technology development and procurement. This report documents an analysis task that MITRE started to as an effort to convert RTI project-specific appendices for the Acquisition Plan to an online format. This analysis was subsequently expanded to include using databases and workflow techniques for the other major acquisition documents. Background \\nThe accelerating pace of technological change in modern warfare poses an ongoing critical threat to joint forces and a challenge to naval programs in particular. The Navy must be able to rapidly identify, develop, and field new mature technologies into its systems to ensure their continued operational effectiveness. At a recent DAU symposium on training for acquisition professionals, Ms. Ellen Lord, Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, made two significant points: Program Managers need to bring data to decisions. What data and metrics do we have  what does the data/trends tell us? Opinions are interesting, but irrelevant. Need good data engineers/analysts. SCO, DIUx, JIDO, and other organizations popped up because 5000.02 didnt do what \\nwe needed it to do Starting as early as 2005, the Navy has been moving to a tiered model where the acquisition of subsystems, component technology products, and functionality is procured separately from the large system integration contracts. Over the last several years this has led to various projects, including Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) projects, Rapid Innovation Fund (RIF) procurements, multiple individual competitive procurements, and Rapid Capability Insertion Projects (RCIP). In most of these cases the procurement approval and Request for Proposals (RFP) have been custom built for each procurement In 2017 the Deputy assistant Secretary of the Navy (DASN) for Research and Engineering (R Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212 defense acquisition, including the Rapid Technology Insertion approach for contracting. The RTI process uses a pre-defined set of procurement documents, and shorter template documents, to take the unique amount of information that a program office needs to define a procurement and shrink it into discrete slices of data. The convergence of template use and supplemental appendices with key data, and a request for data driven oversight and management by OSD and DASN leadership, create an opportunity to test the use of data based tools and methods in lieu of the extensive list of paper plans and reports historically used within the Defense Department. This report provides preliminary analysis and findings regarding that shift from piles of paper into files of data. RTI Template Acquisition Plans, Project Appendices, and the \\nElectronic-AP Historically, and following the instructions in the DoD 5000.02 instructions for acquisition, a program office would develop their own acquisition plan that describes their problem and planned contracts. Most large programs use a program-based document model, since that allowed them to describe the program once in the front and then add appendices for each procurement. A procurement based model for the program would involve writing several plans, each with a separate approval process, taking between several months and a year or two of schedule and effort. In 2014 the PEO for Littoral Combat Ships (PEO LCS) developed an experimental approach to allow program offices to rapidly procure mature technology products using a standard pre- approved Acquisition Plan (AP) and RFP template package, customized for each project via specific appendices to instantiate the project and request proposals. The templates for the RTI process focus on the program data that is different for each program, which ended up being quite compact. In order to move projects quickly, and simplify the amount of paperwork that needs approval, the RTI process adopted the use of a flipped business model, where a standard procurement process is documented in the Acquisition Plan, and then appendices are used to instantiate the acquisition for each project. By applying this model across an enterprise however, a standard approach is endorsed, and the amount of customization needed to instantiate the program is relatively simple. This allowed the use of a short 3 or 4 page appendix for the program office. When this approach was tested on the RTI process it took about 10 months to develop the overall AP but then only 2 weeks to route and approve the appendix for the first project. The RTI process is further described in Appendix A. The AP appendix format is shown in Appendix B of this report, and includes all of the project specific items needed to supplement the RTI AP. 3.1 Adaptation to a Data Base Format In analyzing the appendix of the RTI Acquisition Plan it becomes evident that now the contents of that plan is essentially several dozen pieces of information that can be adapted into a data base type format. In some cases the data record used is a name, in some cases it is a number or a date. In several cases the data field is a free-text paragraph, which allows managers to still provide explanatory information as needed. The data fields adapted from the RTI Appendix are shown Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212 below in Table 3-1. As seen in this listing, the conversion of an acquisition plan into data includes not only the planning dates of a normal plan but a second set of data for actual accomplished dates, which allows for tracking of status and durations for approval timelines. Conversion of the Acquisition Plan into data starts to achieve several objectives. a) It allows use of automation tools such a Sharepoint or Web Logic in order to accumulate \\nthe data associated with the program, b) It enables the use of automated workflow based tools to route the procurement plan for \\napprovals, which allows tracking and status data to accumulate. This in turn allows leadership insight into how long these documents take to approve. c) It enables backward looking data analytics, so that analysis can determine traits of \\nsuccessful programs. These achievements in turn will allow leadership to obtain data-driven answers to such questions as what do successful programs have in common, or what do unsuccessful projects have in common. Statistical correlation techniques can be leveraged to provide strategic oversight and statistical process management. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.

The current record is well below 200,000 feet. Framework for Evaluating Traffic Management Services in \\nHigher Airspace Jennifer Gentry, Anuja Mahashabde, Debra Moch-Mooney \\nThe MITRE Corporation, February 2019 Introduction\\nThere is a vast realm of airspace that remains unexplored, save for a handful of scientific and \\nnational security missions. It is rife with extremes, where flights can reach multi-Mach speeds or \\nstay aloft for months as they slowly circumnavigate the globe. This region lies roughly between \\n52,000 and 160,000 feet and is referred to as higher airspace in this paper.\\nRecent breakthroughs in technology have set the stage for routine commercial operations in this \\nrealm. Companies are investing in ways to harness its potential for a wide range of commercial \\napplications. Until recently, few have contemplated how this assortment of operations will \\ncoexist where the air is thin and manned operations are likely to be the exception, not the rule. \\nTodays air traffic management (ATM) system was designed for legacy aircraft, not unmanned \\nand lighter-than-air operations. As a result, existing flight rules which govern aircraft behavior, \\nare likely to be ill-suited to these non-traditional operations. Just as the current system has \\nadapted to meet user needs, so too will adaptations be needed to safely and equitably serve the \\nneeds of these new users.\\nThus, an assessment of the pros and cons associated with ATM components is needed to \\ndetermine the most suitable path for addressing operational needs in higher airspace. This paper \\npresents a framework for evaluating ATM services in higher airspace based on the International \\nCivil Aviation Organizations (ICAO) Global Air Traffic Management Operational Concept \\n(GATMOC), which enumerates user expectations and ATM components for 2025 and beyond.1 It \\nprovides an understanding of ATM services relevant to higher airspace, viewed through the \\nprism of user expectations along with a discussion of when services beyond what are currently \\navailable may be warranted. Higher Airspace Environment\\nFor the purposes of this paper, higher airspace begins where passenger transport traffic ends, and \\nends where atmospheric density can no longer sustain lift through aerodynamics or buoyancy. As \\nmentioned previously, this region is roughly between 52,000 and 160,000 feet. Operations that \\nrely on aerodynamic lift rarely exceed 100,000 feet, while operations that rely on buoyancy \\ngenerally top out at 140,000 feet, except for some research balloons.2 This region is well below \\nthe Karman line (~330,000 feet), and thus still considered airspace. \\nThe lower boundary is consistent with the Federal Aviation Administrations (FAA) JO7110.65s 2 3 FAA JO 7400.2, Procedures for Handling Airspace Matters, also defines Jet Routes as being between FL180 and FL450.\\n4 Amateur, hobbyist, research and defense related operations, while peripherally considered, are not the focus of this analysis.\\n5 These operations include orbital and suborbital spacecraft, amateur rockets, and air launched rockets. Vehicles returning to earth from orbit also transit this airspace; some are controlled reentries (deorbit) and some are not (decay). definition of Jet Routes as not exceeding Flight \\nLevel (FL) 450.3 Also, FAA Advisory Circular \\nguidance on high altitude operations does not \\naddress altitudes above FL510 [1] [2]. Higher airspace, generally associated with the \\nstratosphere (see Figure 1), differs from the \\ntroposphere below in two key areas: Higher airspace is considered above \\nthe weather. High winds associated with the \\njet stream top out around 50,000 feet; the \\nthunderstorms stop around 60,000 feet. According to the U.S. Naval Flight \\nSurgeons manual [3], from a physiological \\nviewpoint space begins when 50,000 feet is \\nreached since supplemental 100 percent oxygen \\nno longer protects man from hypoxia. Anticipated Operations in Higher \\nAirspace There are two broad categories of commercial operations that can access this region: 1) \\noperations that conduct their mission in higher airspace, and 2) operations that rapidly transit \\nhigher airspace en route to their mission.4 The focus of this paper is on the former, since they are \\nexpected to dwell in higher airspace, and therefore require a range of traffic management \\nservices. Transiting operations will spend little time in this region on the way to their final \\ndestination, typically using segregated airspace.5 The needs of these transiting operations remain \\nthe same throughout their entire trajectory and are not unique to higher airspace. \\nVehicles with wings, rotors, and those that use lighter-than-air gases, rely on air for lift. As \\naltitude increases, the air thins and so does the number of viable operations. Only a handful of \\nspecialized vehicle types can operate with ease in higher airspace. \\nThe five categories of vehicles most likely to operate in this region include: unmanned balloons \\n(e.g., sounding, super pressure and zero pressure), manned balloons (e.g., space tourism), \\nunmanned aircraft, manned aircraft (e.g., supersonic and hypersonic) and unmanned airships. \\nGeneral operational characteristics of these vehicle types are captured in Table 1, and Figure 2 \\nclassifies these diversely performing operations by speed and trajectory. Table 1. Performance of Commercial Vehicles Anticipated to Dwell in Higher Airspace Operation Type Speed Duration Cruise Altitude (feet) Unmanned Balloons (Super and Zero Pressure) Low Hours Months 50,000 to 75,000 Figure 1. Atmospheric Layers 3 Manned Balloons (Space Tourism) Low Hours 100,000 Long Endurance Unmanned Aircraft Low Days Months 60,000 to 85,000 Supersonic Transport Aircraft (Manned) Very High Hours 55,000 to 75,000 Unmanned Airships Low Days 55,000 to 70,000 Figure 2. Commercial Vehicle Types Included in each Performance Category Few operations in higher airspace are expected to maintain a steady altitude on mission. Most \\nlow-speed horizontal trajectory vehicles ascend in altitude with the heat of the day and descend at \\nnight. Some platforms use different altitudes for transiting as opposed to station keeping. Even \\nhigh-speed horizontal trajectory flights will slowly ascend as fuel is burned. High level analysis \\nindicates that the altitude range between FL550 and FL750 is expected to experience the highest \\ndemand. \\nOperations in higher airspace will likely be concentrated in specific geographic locations due to \\ntheir business needs, operational limitations and/or environmental reasons. While the overall \\nanticipated number of operations is low, most of these operations will remain in higher airspace \\nfor extended periods of time. This has significant ATM services implications, as current services \\nare geared toward legacy traffic operations which are greater in number, but considerably shorter \\nin duration.\\nThe following is a list of characteristics unique to commercial operations in higher airspace: Long duration operations (typically months) are highly sensitive to weight and tend to 4 rely on solar power. The thinner the atmosphere, the more difficult it becomes for operations that rely on lift \\nto maneuver. Super and hypersonic aircraft have narrow viable speed ranges (also known as the \\ncoffin corner) and large turning radii. Operations that rely on buoyancy have limited control and maneuverability at all \\naltitudes, including higher airspace, unless an engine is present (e.g., airships). Anticipated Service Implications\\nThe low atmospheric density characteristic of higher airspace and the unique vehicular \\nperformance adaptations for coping with it, pose challenges for an air traffic management system \\nbuilt to accommodate a relatively homogenous fleet of maneuverable and responsive aircraft. \\nHowever, while some operational characteristics may make air traffic management more \\nchallenging, others may actually make it easier. The following categorizes features associated \\nwith higher airspace and its anticipated operations by their expected impact on ATM: Positives\\nThe lack of convective weather and jet stream increase operational predictability.o The preponderance of unmanned operations would result in less severe collision o\\noutcomes.\\nTechnologically advanced operators are likely to be able to coordinate well with o\\nother operators. Negatives:\\nWeight-sensitive vehicles, with limited onboard equipment and power, will limit o\\noptions for ATM integration.\\nHandling off-nominal situations with unmanned operations may be more complex.o New airspace needs associated with constellations of loitering vehicles will o\\nchallenge established norms.\\nThe inability to rely on tactical or last-resort collision avoidance will require o\\ndeconfliction in advance (strategic planning).\\nSingle-use and novel vehicles challenge standard safety practices associated with o\\nairworthiness and equipment certification that enable integration. User Expectations\\nThe most successful service models are informed by user expectations. Fortunately, ICAO has \\noutlined a set of civil aviation user expectations. They can be found in Appendix B of Document \\n9854, Global Air Traffic Management [4]. Not all elements are of equal relevance to the higher \\nairspace community, as they were developed with legacy operations in mind. Table 2 contains 5 6 A recent National Academies of Science press release (June 11, 2018) about its prepublication report on Assessing the Risks of \\nIntegrating Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the National Airspace System [5] stated that, FAA Should Change Its \\nSafety Risk Assessment Approach for Drones to Effectively Integrate Them Into the Nations Airspace.
