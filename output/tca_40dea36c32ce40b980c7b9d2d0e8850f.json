  "text": "3-35 deviations from the slot markers in the feeders airspace. They reported that their goal was to\\nget all aircraft into their slot markers so that the handoff to the final controller would be\\nacceptable and that they felt uncomfortable when aircraft were not in the slot markers. Based on this feedback, it was decided that the slot marker color modification (shown in Figure\\n3-25) was a good initial change to test. Therefore, the chosen modification to test was the trail\\naircraft slot marker color change from white to blue during some scenarios when controller\\nmade the keyboard entry to indicate IM was active. The slot markers for trail aircraft remained\\nblue when an IM trail aircraft was in the suspended state but returned to white when controller\\nmade the keyboard entry to indicate IM was terminated. The slot markers for trail aircraft and\\nall other aircraft remained white. 3.1.3.3.4 Controller Tool Sets for Evaluation\\nThe following three IM tool sets were developed for the simulation to examine the controller\\ninformation needs: Basic: TSAS features, the IM clearance window, as well as the IM trail and lead aircraft\\nstatus fields in the data blocks Basic+ cue: The basic tool set plus the slot marker color change (cue) Basic+ cue and prediction: The basic+ cue tool set plus the spacing prediction value\\n(shown in parentheses after the lead aircraft identification in the IM clearance window) 3.1.4 Pseudo-Pilot Workstation\\nPseudo-pilots acted as pilots for all (some IM capable and some not IM capable) aircraft other\\nthan the participant flight crews aircraft. This allowed the controller to interact normally with\\nthe traffic. It also allowed aircraft to maneuver based on controller instructions, which is\\nreflected on both the controller and flight crew displays. The pseudo-pilots used an interface\\ntermed Simpilot which allowed users to simultaneously control multiple simulated aircraft\\n(Figure 3-29). It provided basic information about the aircraft (e.g., aircraft call sign, type) and\\nallowed the pseudo-pilot to control various aspects of the aircraft (e.g., heading, airspeed,\\naltitude, route, communications frequency) and respond to controller instructions by entering\\ncommands. The pseudo-pilots also initiated, suspended, resumed, and terminated IM per instructions from\\nthe controller. When the controller entered the command to accept the IM clearance, a pop-up\\nwindow with the clearance information was displayed to the pseudo-pilot. Once the controller\\nissued the IM clearance via a voice communication, the pseudo-pilot acknowledged the\\nclearance and then pressed ok in the window to engage the IM sample algorithm. This\\nimplementation was to assist the pseudo-pilot (who was managing several aircraft) in entering\\nall the information associated with the IM clearance. However, it made the acceptance and\\nentry of the clearance easier than it was for the participant aircraft flight crews and is more like\\na CPDLC implementation that allowed for loading of the IM clearance into the fight deck IM\\nequipment without the need to memorize or write down the information and then type it in. 3-36 Figure 3-29. Pseudo-Pilot Interface (Simpilot) 3-37 3.1.5 Airspace\\nThe airspace modeled for this simulation was based on Phoenix International Airport (KPHX).\\nNorth RNAV operations were run and aircraft landed to the west on runway 26, which was\\noperated as a landing only runway. Aircraft also landed on runway 25L but as independent\\noperations (even though real-world operations at KPHX are not run independently). The airport\\nenvironment is shown in Figure 3-30. The weather was visual meteorological conditions. Figure 3-30. PHX Airport. The two RNAV arrival procedures (BRUSR1 and EAGUL6) that were used were heavily based on\\ncurrent arrival procedures. Minor modifications were made to have the arrival connect to the\\ninstrument approach procedure. Modifications were also made to accommodate the RNP RF\\nturns. RNP RF turns onto final approach can be challenging for controllers but are expected to\\nbe supported by TSAS and will continue to be part of arrival and approach procedures in the\\nterminal metering environment (Wynnyk and Kopald, 2013). Therefore, they were examined to\\ndetermine the impact of IM. The airspace had one feeder (Apache airspace) and one final (Freeway airspace) position. Figure\\n3-31 provides an overview of the airspace. The waypoints and the associated altitude and\\nspeed constraints for the arrival procedures as shown in Figure 3-32. The TSAS constraint points\\nused in the simulation were RHYAN (RNP RF turn start), DERVL (merge point outside final), and\\nYOKXO (FAF). 3-38 Figure 3-31. PHX-Like Airspace Overview: Arrival Procedures and Controller Airspace Figure 3-32. Arrival Procedures 3-39 Based on the arrival and approach geometries, a mix of different types of aircraft pairings could\\noccur. For example, aircraft flying RNAV arrivals could follow aircraft flying the same or a\\ndifferent RNAV arrival. An aircraft flying the BRUSR1 arrival with the RNP RF turn could follow\\nanother aircraft flying the RNP RF turn, or it could follow an aircraft flying either RNAV arrival\\nwithout the RNP RF turn. Aircraft flying either arrival could follow an aircraft flying the BRUSR1\\narrival with the RNP RF turn. The geometries are shown in Figure 3-34 on the next page (with\\npotential IM pairings noted). One of the more interesting geometries is shown in Figure 3-33,\\nwhere an aircraft flying the BRUSR1 RNAV arrival is following an aircraft flying the BRUSR1 with\\nthe RNP RF turn. The sequence to the runway designed by TBFM can initially appear confusing if\\nthe RNP RF turn is not considered. Figure 3-33. Geometry Where RNAV Aircraft is Following RNP RF Turn Aircraft on the Same\\nArrival 3-40 Figure 3-34. Traffic Pairing Geometries 3-41 The IM operations were Multi-Stream Arrivals with Metering, as defined in Hicok and Barmore\\n(2016) (Figure 3-35). Figure 3-35. Sample IM Operations with the PTP and ABP Options 3.1.6 Traffic\\nSimulation traffic included the participants aircraft along with other aircraft arriving from the\\nnorth for the RNAV approach to Runway 26 (as shown previously in Figure 3-31). Aircraft also\\nlanded on runway 25L, but as independent operations. Attempts were made to develop traffic\\nflows that were high density and kept the controller workload at a high but reasonable level.\\nThe arrival rate was approximately 40 aircraft per hour to Runway 26. The higher workload\\nenvironment was desirable to keep the controllers engaged, but not so much that disturbances\\nin the traffic flow occurred (and vectoring became necessary). The intent was to examine the\\nintegration of IM operations in the terminal metering environment without disturbances. The\\ndensity of the flow was modified several times prior to selecting the final density for data\\ncollection based on controller and ground expert inputs during the concept evaluations.\\nEquivalent traffic levels were used through the entire simulation to avoid workload differences\\nbetween scenarios. Each traffic file was derived from real world traffic files with arrivals to\\nKPHX. At scenario start, traffic started arriving from the two flows and gradually built to the full\\ndensity of traffic that lasted until the data collection was complete for the scenario and the 3-42 scenario was terminated by one of the researchers (typically at the point where the participant\\naircraft landed and / or when the final off-nominal event occurred). All aircraft in the simulation were capable of flying the RNAV arrivals. There was a mixture of\\naircraft that were capable of flying the RNP RF turn (approximately 20%) and aircraft that were\\nnot capable of flying the RNP RF turn (approximately 80%). This RNP RF turn capability split was\\ncoordinated with key stakeholders and believed to represent a reasonable number of aircraft\\ncapable in the future of flying the more challenging routing. All aircraft in the simulation were ADS-B out and capable of as acting as an IM lead aircraft.\\nThere was a mixture of aircraft that were capable as acting as an IM trail aircraft (approximately\\n60%) and aircraft that were not capable as acting as IM aircraft (approximately 40%). This IM\\ncapability split was also coordinated with key stakeholders and believed to represent a\\nreasonable mix of aircraft. It was also an increase over past work done under ATD-1 (as\\nreviewed in Section 2.4.2.2). However, it is reasonably short of 100% equipage, which is unlikely\\nto be realistic in the near term and may be easier to manage based on not having to deal with\\nthe difficulties of mixed equipage. The participant aircraft was always IM capable (except in one\\nbaseline condition). Aircraft were delivered from the en route environment to the TRACON boundary with a set\\ndeviation around the center of the slot markers, which simulated the management of aircraft\\nby an en route controller prior to them entering the TRACON. Aircraft arrived no earlier than 30\\nseconds and no later than 15 seconds, with a distribution between those maximum values. The\\nexpected delivery for terminal metering operations is approximately +/- 30 seconds (Robinson\\net al., 2015). However, based on aircraft being able to more easily decelerate than accelerate in\\nthe TRACON, and the chosen arrival procedures, the 15-second threshold was chosen for this\\nactivity. This is consistent with a simulation reported in Callatine et al. (2014) in which en route\\ncontrollers were asked to deliver aircraft +/- 30 seconds with a preference for the early side. Pseudo-piloted aircraft were mainly large but also included heavy category aircraft. Aircraft\\ntypes included: Airbus A306, Airbus A319, Airbus A320, Airbus A321, Boeing 717-200, Boeing\\n737-300, Boeing B737-700, Boeing 737-800, Boeing 737-900, Boeing 767-300, Bombardier\\nCRJ200, Bombardier CRJ700, Bombardier CRJ900, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, McDonnell\\nDouglas MD-11, and McDonnell Douglas MD-90. Pseudo-piloted aircraft flew final approach\\nspeeds of either 140 or 150 kts6. The aircraft started to slow to the final approach speed at the\\nFAF. Pseudo-piloted aircraft that performed",
