When creating a new program, the drafting and signature review of regulatory and statutory documentation to support the milestone review process is a major schedule driver. Each documents content contains a significant amount of common information and a small set of information of interest only to the applicable community (contracts, systems engineering, test, cybersecurity, etc.). Based on experience creating the Rapid Technology Insertion (RTI) process, it seems possible that using database and workflow methods for statutory and regulatory documents can dramatically accelerate technology development and procurement. This report documents an analysis task that MITRE started to as an effort to convert RTI project-specific appendices for the Acquisition Plan to an online format. This analysis was subsequently expanded to include using databases and workflow techniques for the other major acquisition documents. Background \\nThe accelerating pace of technological change in modern warfare poses an ongoing critical threat to joint forces and a challenge to naval programs in particular. The Navy must be able to rapidly identify, develop, and field new mature technologies into its systems to ensure their continued operational effectiveness. At a recent DAU symposium on training for acquisition professionals, Ms. Ellen Lord, Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, made two significant points: Program Managers need to bring data to decisions. What data and metrics do we have  what does the data/trends tell us? Opinions are interesting, but irrelevant. Need good data engineers/analysts. SCO, DIUx, JIDO, and other organizations popped up because 5000.02 didnt do what \\nwe needed it to do Starting as early as 2005, the Navy has been moving to a tiered model where the acquisition of subsystems, component technology products, and functionality is procured separately from the large system integration contracts. Over the last several years this has led to various projects, including Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) projects, Rapid Innovation Fund (RIF) procurements, multiple individual competitive procurements, and Rapid Capability Insertion Projects (RCIP). In most of these cases the procurement approval and Request for Proposals (RFP) have been custom built for each procurement In 2017 the Deputy assistant Secretary of the Navy (DASN) for Research and Engineering (R Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212 defense acquisition, including the Rapid Technology Insertion approach for contracting. The RTI process uses a pre-defined set of procurement documents, and shorter template documents, to take the unique amount of information that a program office needs to define a procurement and shrink it into discrete slices of data. The convergence of template use and supplemental appendices with key data, and a request for data driven oversight and management by OSD and DASN leadership, create an opportunity to test the use of data based tools and methods in lieu of the extensive list of paper plans and reports historically used within the Defense Department. This report provides preliminary analysis and findings regarding that shift from piles of paper into files of data. RTI Template Acquisition Plans, Project Appendices, and the \\nElectronic-AP Historically, and following the instructions in the DoD 5000.02 instructions for acquisition, a program office would develop their own acquisition plan that describes their problem and planned contracts. Most large programs use a program-based document model, since that allowed them to describe the program once in the front and then add appendices for each procurement. A procurement based model for the program would involve writing several plans, each with a separate approval process, taking between several months and a year or two of schedule and effort. In 2014 the PEO for Littoral Combat Ships (PEO LCS) developed an experimental approach to allow program offices to rapidly procure mature technology products using a standard pre- approved Acquisition Plan (AP) and RFP template package, customized for each project via specific appendices to instantiate the project and request proposals. The templates for the RTI process focus on the program data that is different for each program, which ended up being quite compact. In order to move projects quickly, and simplify the amount of paperwork that needs approval, the RTI process adopted the use of a flipped business model, where a standard procurement process is documented in the Acquisition Plan, and then appendices are used to instantiate the acquisition for each project. By applying this model across an enterprise however, a standard approach is endorsed, and the amount of customization needed to instantiate the program is relatively simple. This allowed the use of a short 3 or 4 page appendix for the program office. When this approach was tested on the RTI process it took about 10 months to develop the overall AP but then only 2 weeks to route and approve the appendix for the first project. The RTI process is further described in Appendix A. The AP appendix format is shown in Appendix B of this report, and includes all of the project specific items needed to supplement the RTI AP. 3.1 Adaptation to a Data Base Format In analyzing the appendix of the RTI Acquisition Plan it becomes evident that now the contents of that plan is essentially several dozen pieces of information that can be adapted into a data base type format. In some cases the data record used is a name, in some cases it is a number or a date. In several cases the data field is a free-text paragraph, which allows managers to still provide explanatory information as needed. The data fields adapted from the RTI Appendix are shown Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212 below in Table 3-1. As seen in this listing, the conversion of an acquisition plan into data includes not only the planning dates of a normal plan but a second set of data for actual accomplished dates, which allows for tracking of status and durations for approval timelines. Conversion of the Acquisition Plan into data starts to achieve several objectives. a) It allows use of automation tools such a Sharepoint or Web Logic in order to accumulate \\nthe data associated with the program, b) It enables the use of automated workflow based tools to route the procurement plan for \\napprovals, which allows tracking and status data to accumulate. This in turn allows leadership insight into how long these documents take to approve. c) It enables backward looking data analytics, so that analysis can determine traits of \\nsuccessful programs. These achievements in turn will allow leadership to obtain data-driven answers to such questions as what do successful programs have in common, or what do unsuccessful projects have in common. Statistical correlation techniques can be leveraged to provide strategic oversight and statistical process management. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.
