The IT security \\ncontrols that are most relevant for mobile security were found in the Working Off-Site section of \\nthe ISM, so our comparison primarily focuses on controls from that section of the report. \\nOverall, our analysis found that the Practice Guide mapped nicely to ISM controls.

A summary of each mapped ISM control and its applicability to the \\nPractice Guide is provided in the narrative. 5.1.1 Key Findings The ISM and the Practice Guide align in the use of encryption, in enabling device security \\nfunctions, and in the ability to destroy data on lost devices. Additionally, the Practice Guide \\nprovides some alignment with the ISM on device integrity and the need for audit and monitoring. \\nThe Practice Guide exceeds the ISM controls by addressing the identity and authorization and \\nprivacy protection security characteristics in the mobile context. While these topics are addressed \\nby the ISM from an enterprise level, the Practice Guide provides specific practical \\nimplementations of these characteristics that directly affect mobile device usage. Personnel awareness (Control 1083), however, is not addressed by the Practice Guide. Australian \\norganizations that attempt to implement the Practice Guide should take steps to make device \\nowners aware of the activities that are permitted for data communications. For example, an \\norganization may want to inform personnel that communicating sensitive budget data over Green denotes that the Practice Guide security characteristic was mapped to five or more ISM \\ncontrols, while yellow represents that one to four controls have been mapped. Red denotes the \\nsecurity characteristic was not mapped to the control or guideline, thus signifying a gap. \\n20 insecure transport such as short message service (SMS) is inappropriate. Further, the use of \\nprivacy filters or screens as a method to dissuade shoulder surfing is not included in the Practice \\nGuide as a threat mitigation tactic. The Practice Guide attempts to find a reasonable balance \\nbetween security and user functionality. As such, the use of screen filters was not included in the \\nPractice Guide because it minimally reduces the threat surface while simultaneously having a \\nnegative effect on mobile device functionality due to reduced screen viewing area. The ISM Control Manual encourages adopting organizations to ensure that the carrier service \\ncan provide security updates to the mobile device as soon as they become available. This is an \\nimportant consideration for organizations, especially those that rely on Android devices. Updates \\nto the Android operating systems are typically delivered through the carrier that provides service \\nto the device [27]. This can lead to unreasonable delay in receiving important security updates. \\nThe Practice Guide does not incorporate this risk into the guidelines, but it is advisable for \\nadopting organizations to assess this risk. A final observation is that some of the gaps identified between the ISM and the Practice Guide \\nare largely due to the difference in the intended audience. The intended audience for the Practice \\nGuide is industry rather than government. The Practice Guide attempts to provide practical, real-\\nworld security guidelines that most organizations can adopt rather than bespoke solutions that a \\nfederal agency charged with protecting classified data requires. 5.1.2 Technical findings Data Protection ISM Control 0869 directs the use of cryptographic protection on all mobile devices utilized by an \\norganization. This is directly addressed by the Practice Guide with a device-level encryption \\npolicy that recommends using the file encryption on mobile device capability, which employs \\nFederal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2approved cryptographic modules. Control 1085 directs the use of encryption over public communication mechanisms for sensitive \\nor classified information. The Practice Guide does not address any classified data but does \\nrecommend data-in-transit encryption for all communications over untrusted networks. The \\nPractice Guide documents the use of transport layer security (TLS) for all communications to \\ncloud services and on-premises components. Control 0864 directs agencies to prevent device owners from disabling security functions once \\nprovisioned. For example, if a security policy disables the use of the camera, the device user \\nshould not be able to circumvent the control and activate the camera. This control is directly \\naddressed in the Practice Guide and involves using a mobile device management (MDM) \\ncapability built into the mobile operating system. The mobile operating system prevents any \\nmodification of security policy by the device user when under management. Controls 0705 and 1345 disable the use of VPN split tunneling on devices when the mobile \\ndevice is capable of such a configuration. Split tunneling could potentially allow an attacker \\nfrom an unsecured network to infiltrate a secure VPN connection. The architecture described in \\nthe Practice Guide does not allow the use of split tunneling when accessing organizational \\nresources by the established network security policies and a lack of VPN exercised within the \\narchitecture. \\n21 Controls 0700, 0701, and 0702 all relate to the ability to destroy data that resides on the device in \\nan emergency. This functionality is supported in the Practice Guide through the remote wipe \\ncapability within the MDM. When executed, remote wipe renders access to enterprise data \\ninfeasible through cryptographically secure processes. Data Isolation ISM Control 1047 mandates the use of a technical means to separate sensitive organization-\\nowned data from any personal information that is stored on the mobile device. This functionality \\nis described in the Practice Guide: Use native operating system process isolation techniques that \\nprevent applications from accessing, gathering, or modifying information from other \\napplications. Device Integrity ISM Control 1399 permits the use of personally owned mobile devices only when the \\nconfiguration of the mobile device meets security policy. This is supported by the Practice Guide \\ncloud-only architecture through the deployment of mobile threat detection (MTD) on the mobile \\nendpoint. The MTD client has the capability of reporting device integrity status (such as if the \\ndevice has been rooted or jailbroken) to an administrator. IT security personnel can revoke \\naccess to organization resources if the MTD client reports that a mobile device is out of \\ncompliance. Control 1367, similar to control 1399, directs the use of a security policy enforcement capability \\nwhen the mobile device is organizationally owned. The Practice Guide hybrid architecture \\nsatisfies this requirement by using MDM capabilities. IT security personnel can revoke access to \\norganizational resources when the MDM reports noncompliance of a mobile device. Monitoring Controls 0862 and 0863 recommend regular auditing and configuration control of mobile devices \\nin the same manner as devices in an office environmentas a method to ensure that the state of \\nsecurity on the mobile device has not degraded over time. As mentioned in previous sections, the \\nuse of an MDM will apply technical controls to a mobile device that complies with \\norganizational security policy, but regular monitoring is essential to detect abnormalities that \\nrepresent a coordinated attack. The hybrid architecture in the Practice Guide addresses this \\nrequirement by deploying a systems management software product in the enterprise. The \\nsolution can deploy configuration controls for both traditional workstation endpoints and mobile \\ndevices through one administrative console. Similarly, hardware and software inventories are \\navailable for audit through the systems management solution. Identity and Authorization The ISM control manual coverage of identity and authorization security characteristics is at an \\nenterprise level and is not mobile specific. Specifically, the ISM Control Manuals Access",
