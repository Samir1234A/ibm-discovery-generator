ICT-2 \\nYou should be aware of the personal information you hold on your ICT system and where it is \\nlocated. ICT-3 \\nYour ICT security measures should ensure that all of your systems are secure and that they \\nprovide a safe environment for your staff to carry out your business. ICT-4 Your ICT security measures should ensure that all of your systems are secure and that they \\nprovide a safe environment for your customers to interact with your agency or business, for \\nexample, when they make payments or provide their banking details and/or other personal \\ninformation. ICT-5 \\nICT security measures help mitigate the risks of internal and external attackers and the \\ndamage caused by malicious software such as malware, computer viruses, and other harmful \\nprograms. ICT-6 \\nYou need to consider the security of all systems that use or interact with your ICT system. \\nThis includes securing your website(s), social media platforms, and mobile device applications \\n(apps). ICT-7 \\nAs well as ICT security against external and internal threats, it is important to consider the \\npossibility of human error (for example, misplacing devices such as laptops and data storage \\ndevices, noting that encryption and password protection can mitigate this risk). ICT-8 \\nAs well as ICT security against external and internal threats, it is important to consider the \\npossibility of hardware or software malfunctions. ICT-9 \\nAs well as ICT security against external and internal threats, it is important to consider the \\npossibility of power failure. ICT-10 \\nAs well as ICT security against external and internal threats, it is important to consider the \\npossibility of system failure caused by natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and \\nextreme weather conditions. \\nTable 6 maps the requirements above to the security characteristics found in the Practice Guide.

The recent introduction of the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data \\nBreaches) Act 2017 will require organizations with obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 to \\ncomply with data protection regulations when handling personal information [28]. Australian \\norganizations should consider the effect of mobile device usage within their organization when \\nhandling personal consumer data, and more broadly, the Australian Privacy Principles. The ICT requirements if adapted for the mobile environment provide broad coverage of the \\nsecurity characteristics described in the Practice Guide. One characteristic that is covered in the \\nPractice Guide but not addressed specifically by the ICT is privacy protection. It is worth noting \\nthat the focus of the Practice Guide is on specific security controls and standards that support \\nprivacy, for example, by enabling confidentiality of data. Such detailed controls and standards \\nare often missing from government regulations or guidelines, which is not necessarily an issue if \\nthe goal of such documents is to provide high-level direction rather than specific technical \\nguidelines. For this reason, companies following the ICT requirements would need to augment Green denotes that the Practice Guide security characteristic was mapped to two or more \\nrequirements, while yellow represents a mapping to one requirement. Red denotes that the security \\ncharacteristic was not mapped to any requirements, thus signifying a gap. \\n30 that information with practical mobile-specific guidelines that address the challenges faced when \\nimplementing a secure mobile program. Conversely, the Practice Guide does not address four \\nICT requirements that relate to IT governance because they are out of scope for this particular \\nPractice Guide. 5.3.2 Technical Findings Data Protection ICT-5 and ICT-7 are broad requirements to ensure that security measures are in place to protect \\nagainst external and internal threats. These requirements cite a need for protection against \\nmalicious software and human error, both of which apply to mobile devices. The Practice Guide \\narchitectures (cloud-only and hybrid) protect against malicious software (more commonly \\nreferred to as malware in a mobile context) with the deployment of an MTD client on the mobile \\ndevice as a requirement before the device owner is permitted to access organizational resources. \\nIn addition, the Practice Guide describes the use of device ecosystemprovided application store \\nmalware detection tools (e.g., Google Play Protect) that scan applications from developers as \\napplications are uploaded, which prevents the spread of malware to end users. Human error, \\nsuch as the device owner losing the mobile device, is protected against by use of an MDM. With \\nappropriate organizational policy, the device owner is required to report a missing device to the \\nappropriate personnel. The MDM administrator is then able to take actions such as wiping or \\nphysically locating the phone through features of the MDM. Data Isolation The Practice Guide architectures protect against mobile malware (ICT-5) by using common \\noperating system techniques. Process isolation prevents malware on the mobile device from \\naccessing, gathering, or modifying information from other legitimate applications. Trust \\nexecution environments further isolate sensitive operations from malware on the device. Device Integrity The Practice Guide architectures protect against mobile malware (ICT-5) by using device-\\nspecific integrity checks such as operating system boot validation, cryptographically protected \\napplication, and operating system updates. The first technique blocks the execution of the \\noperating system when modifications have been detected. The use of cryptographically protected \\napplications and operating system updates increases the difficulty of an attacker to distribute \\nmobile malware. Monitoring Requirement ICT-1 uses regular monitoring of systems as a method to detect threats and \\nvulnerabilities that may provide an attacker a vector to access, gather, or modify personal data. \\nThe Practice Guide hybrid build supports this requirement through automated alerts that are sent \\nto designated personnel when policy violations occur, such as when malware is detected on the \\ndevice. The mobile device can then be remotely wiped or other actions performed as \\norganizational policy dictates. \\n31 Identity and Authorization Requirement ICT-7 suggests the use of passwords as a mechanism to protect against human \\nerror, such as when a device is lost by the device owner. The Practice Guide cloud-only and \\nhybrid builds support this requirement through enforcement of an MDM policy that requires the \\ndevice user to set a pass code needed to unlock the device. The device automatically locks after a \\nconfigured number of attempts and can be unlocked only by administrator action. At an \\napplication level, the hybrid build further requires an enterprise password to access resources \\nsuch as email, calendar, and contacts. Privacy Protection No ICT requirements directly map to this Practice Guide security characteristic. This is discussed \\nfurther below. 5.4 Mapping Overview \\nA diagram summarizing MITREs mapping of key Australian mobile security guidelines to the \\nPractice Guide is provided in Figure 4. Three of the six security controlsdata protection, data \\nisolation, and device integritywere addressed by all three Australian documents to some \\nextent. One of the controls, monitoring, was addressed only by the ISM. Another control, \\nidentity and authorization, was addressed by the Essential Eight and ICT guidelines but not in the \\nISM. The privacy protection security control was found to be a gap across all three Australian \\nguidelines. In addition, privacy on mobile devices can be achieved by implementing other \\ntechnical security controls. For example, in the Practice Guide, privacy protection as a security \\ncontrol includes informed consent of user, data monitoring minimization, and privacy \\nnotification provided to user. \\n32 Figure 4 Security Control Mapping Comparison ISM Control Mapping Essential Eight Mapping \\nGuide to Securing \\nPersonal Information Mapping \\n33 Findings and Recommendations \\nMany organizations in Australia, most notably SMEs, have little understanding of the risks",
