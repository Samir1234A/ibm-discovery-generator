Third, FFS is not conducive to the pursuit of care delivery innovations that are capable of better addressing complex issues, such as social determinants of health and care management for patients with multiple chronic conditions. This is because solutions to these types of issues require considerable coordination beyond the walls of the clinic or hospital, which cannot realistically be itemized on a fee schedule. By supporting successful initiatives to address social determinants and chronic comorbidities, value-based payments can improve, but not completely remediate, outcomes related to patients complexities. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2546. 20 As illustrated in Figure 3, Category 4 APMs have the potential to give providers additional opportunities and flexibility when establishing and maintaining delivery system components that improve the value of care (compared to Category 3 APMs). This is because Category 4 APMs provide stronger incentives to decrease costs while using quality and appropriateness-of-care measures to hold providers accountable for maintaining or improving quality standards. Category 4 APMs can also be more administratively efficient to pay providers prospectively, instead of reimbursing each individual claim and undergoing an extensive retrospective reconciliation at the end of the performance period. However, individual providers should not feel compelled to enter Category 4 arrangements if they believe doing so could adversely impact practices and patients. As discussed in Principle 6, providers should only assume as much risk as needed to maximize the value of care delivered, which means Category 3 will serve as an ultimate destination for some providers. Above all, the systemic imperative to move payments into Categories 3 and 4 will need to be balanced against individual providers readiness to change payment and delivery models. Striking the proper balance between these potentially conflicting priorities will require considerable trust amongst all stakeholder groups, in order to move at the best pace for patients and consumers. Principle 4: To the greatest extent possible, value-based incentives should reach providers across the care team that directly delivers care. Payment reforms for quality improvement and cost reduction are most effective when they directly impact payments for clinicians who are principally responsible for providing care to patients. These incentives are effective because providers delivering patient care are best positioned to develop processes and practices, which drive well-coordinated, and high-value care that ultimately lead to better outcomes. For example, an ACO that is at risk for cost and quality would ideally design financial incentives for physicians and their care teams and hospitals that achieve outcomes that matter to patients. It may not always be possible to measure accurately the degree to which incentive payments reach front-line providers. Nevertheless, this should become a best practice, because making population-based payments to provider organizations that, in turn, pay care teams on an FFS basis will not harness the full potential of the incentives in the APM. This is particularly important in light of the recent growth in physician employment, because employed physicians often do not receive performance feedback directly.14 The question of how far incentive payments should reach, and whether it is appropriate for individual clinicians to receive incentive payments, raises difficult and complicated issues. On the one hand, it is essential to reward clinicians who deliver high-value, person-centered care, because they are the ones who work directly with patients to achieve positive outcomes. On the other hand, risk-adjustment methodologies and illness severity scales do not always sufficiently account for patient complexity, so rewarding individual providers could unintentionally encourage adverse selection against patients with complex medical needs. Additionally, when compared to financial incentives for practices or physician \\n14 See, for example: Farmer S., Darling M.A., George M., Casale P.N., Hagan E., and McClellan M.B. (2017). Existing and Emerging Payment and Delivery Reforms in Cardiology. JAMA Cardiology, 2(2), 210-217. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2546. 21 groups, financial incentives for individuals may not be reinvested as much in improvements to care delivery. Therefore, APMs need to carefully evaluate incentive structures for provider groups and individual clinicians, to ensure that there are sufficient protections for complex patients, that individual clinicians are fairly compensated for delivering exemplary care, and that incentive payments are used to sustain delivery system transformations. Additional patient protections such as independent oversight and robust venues for voicing patient concerns may also be needed during the transition from FFS to population-based payment. Principle 5: Payment models that do not take quality and value into account will not be designated as value-based. They will not be considered APMs for the purposes of tracking progress toward payment reform. As illustrated in Figure 4, the APM Framework represents a continuum of payment approaches across four Categories. Category 1 represents FFS payment not linked to quality incentives. Categories 2 through 4 advance successively beyond traditional FFS payment. There is limited merit in moving toward population-based payments if the resulting payment models do not include incentives to deliver quality care based on current clinical evidence on how to achieve outcomes that matter to patients. Although specific recommendations about what constitutes meaningful quality measurement is beyond the scope of this paper, several general elements are critical. APMs should use harmonized measure sets that include measures of process, clinical outcomes, patient-reported outcomes, and patient experience of care. Quality measures should be appropriately adjusted for patient mix, and whenever possible the measures used should be nationally vetted and endorsed by professional organizations, the National Quality Forum, the Core Quality Measures Collaborative, and others involved in developing consensus on measure specifications and core sets. Measure sets should also be robust enough to provide a comprehensive portrait of a populations clinical and behavioral health. Measure sets should address the full spectrum of care, care continuity, and overall performance of specific models, but individual measures should be granular enough to enable patients to make informed decisions about providers and treatments. Payment models that represent some movement away from traditional FFS, but do not take quality and appropriateness into account, will be placed under the corresponding payment category and marked with an N to indicate No Quality considerations (e.g., population-based payments not linked to value will fall into Category 4N). Accordingly, such models will not be considered to represent progress toward true payment reform, and are not tracked as part of measuring the achievement of the LANs goals. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2546. 22 Principle 6: In order to maximize the value of care that providers deliver and to reach the LANs goals for payment reform, value-based incentives should be sufficiently meaningful for providers to invest in and implement delivery reforms, without subjecting providers to risk that is beyond their financial means and/or clinical scope of care. When considering approaches to making value-based incentives meaningful for providers, it is useful to distinguish between two kinds of risk even though they are difficult to separate in practice (for further discussion, please see the description of Category 4 APMs below): management risk, and insurance risk. There is widespread agreement on three different principles about how risk should be deployed in APMs. First, individual providers should not be placed in the position of assuming insurance risk, because payers and large health systems are specifically designed to perform this function. Second, APMs can be effective stimuli for delivery system change because providers will develop and sustain innovative approaches to care delivery when they are subjected to certain levels of management risk. Third, excessive levels of management risk can lead to perverse consequences, such as the delivery of inappropriately intensive care (either too much or too little), and potential access problems if critical provider groups are forced out of business. Therefore, value-based incentives should avoid imposing insurance risk on providers, while seeking to find the optimal degree of management risk to maximize beneficial drivers of health care transformation and simultaneously minimizing counterproductive drawbacks. When striking this balance, the overarching objective should be to maximize the value of care for patients and consumers: levels of management risk should not be based on goals for payment reform that are dissociated from goals for improving care delivery. When considering levels of management risk, it is important to consider attributes of the providers who will assume that risk. For example, compared to small providers, large providers are better equipped to manage financial risk by making service adjustments. Therefore, management risk will need to be higher for large providers to make meaningful transitions to value-based care delivery. Similarly, factors such as practice size, availability of cash reserves, provider readiness, scope of practice, and geography can all impact the amount of financial risk that providers are able to bear. Safety-net providers experience considerable volatility in their financial margins and typically have to operate without substantial cash reserves; these factors make it difficult and potentially counterproductive for them to take on significant amounts of performance and financial risk. Practices with a large scope and diversity of care will have greater influence over the total costs of care for its",
