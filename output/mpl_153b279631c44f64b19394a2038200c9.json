Public Release Case Number 18-4487 Fighting Polio in Africa, Thanks to MITRE's Civic Leave Program As a group leader in the International Operations Department, Melissa Utzinger travels the globe helping \\nforeign governments overcome engineering issues. Her typical challenge involves providing rigorous \\nengineering analysis to inform key decision making of partner nations and the U.S. Their goal: to develop \\nan integrated, cohesive system that gets the job done. But recently, she was overseas to tackle a much \\ndifferent challengehow to administer a polio vaccine to a child under five years old. I was a little nervous about it because I dont have a medical background, but fortunately it was drops \\nand not an injection, she says. And I brought boxes of raisins and gave one to every kid after they got \\ntwo drops under their tongue. Pretty soon, the adults were encouraging more kids to do it, so they could \\nget raisins too. Utzinger joined a humanitarian mission sponsored by Rotary International in Benin, a tiny sliver of a \\ncountry on the border of Nigeria in West Africa. Rotary is a founding partner of the Global Polio \\nEradication Initiative, which has immunized more than 2.5 billion children against the disease in 122 \\ncountries. And despite Utzinger's busy work schedule, MITRE not only supported her desire to help others, but also \\nprovided paid time off through our civic leave program. Working for the Health of Childrenand Trees Using her 40 hours of paid volunteer service time, Utzinger flew into the capital city of Cotonou on \\nOctober 2 and spent part of the next week vaccinating the people most vulnerable to this deadly \\ninfectious disease. By the end of her stay, the Rotary volunteers had provided inoculations to more than \\n200 children. The volunteers met in the mornings at a health center where local mothers and children were already \\nlined up to receive the vaccinations. People got so dressed up to come, she says. You could tell it was \\nan important event for them. In the afternoons, Utzinger and her teammates went door-to-door in the neighboring slums. Each person \\nhad a distinct job: locate eligible children, maintain a wearable freezer compartment to keep the \\nvaccines cold, administer the vaccines, and place a mark on each childs left pinky to identify those who \\nreceived inoculations. Team members made their way through the streets, leaving chalk marks on each house to indicate how \\nmany children lived in each one and how many had been inoculated. If they missed any children the first \\ntime around, the team stopped in again on the way home to try and find them. As part of the mission, Rotary International gave each participant a day away from the inoculation work \\nto pursue other volunteer work. Utzinger opted to spend her day planting trees outside the city. She \\nplanted a variety of fast-growing saplings, some for firewood and some with medicinal purposes, such as \\npain relief. Copyright \\nApproved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-4487 Back in her office in Bedford, Massachusetts, Utzinger has been working on a project to help a partner \\nnation integrate their missile defense capabilities into its overall defense architecture while enhancing \\ncoalition, U.S., and regional security capabilities. But the lessons from Benin are never far from her mind. The experience really gave me a better perspective on life here, she says. You realize how fortunate \\nwe are here to have something as basic as clean running waterand you realize how important it is to \\nreach out and help other people. What Is MITRE's Civic Leave Program? The civic leave program offers MITRE employees up to 40 hours of paid time each year for volunteering \\non civic and community projects. It's been around for decades and is extremely popular, says Sue \\nStapleton, who runs the program. In 2018, about 1,300 employees applied for it. The projects include international work, such as providing public health education on HIV in India and \\nconstructing orphanages in the Dominican Republic. Closer to home, the program covers work in \\nfoodbanks, STEM mentoring and outreach, hurricane relief, and work with veterans and senior citizens. \\nRequests must be approved by the appropriate manager. The civic leave program really underscores how important working in the public good is here at MITRE, \\nStapleton says. As a company, our commitment doesnt end with the work day. We really want to \\nsupport our employees in giving back to their communities in their personal lives as well. --by Twig Mowatt PHOTO: _top\\n _Hlk531610489\\n _GoBack \",",

  "text": "value of network traffic presumed to be observed under shortest path. This is a shortfall, and must be addressed in future research. The first definition of an attack with observers will use the following data. SET CONDITION DESCRIPTION N Set of underneath nodes N0 N0 N Super node set representing external attack origins L L N,N0 L = Leaf nodes A Set of arcs attacks can occur over NM NM N Nodes containing observers of value to the attacker AM AM (N\\\\N0) (N\\\\N0) Set of node pairs (s, t) with valued traffic The physical network contains NM and AM , defining the observers and the pairs of nodes between which observing their traffic is desirable. The assumption will be that traffic for (s, t) AM will travel along the shortest path from s to t, using only nodes that have not been attacked. If that path is incident with a node in NM , the traffic (s, t) will be considered observed. PARAMETER CONDITION DESCRIPTION ca a A Cost to attack via an arc b Budget for attacks 17 VARIABLE CONDITION DESCRIPTION wi i N\\\\N0, wi [0, 1] Indicator of disabling of a node pa a A, pa [0, 1] Indicator of an attack via an arc ui,a i N/baclaN, Attack path indicator for each node a A, ui,a [0.1] m(s,t) (s, t) AM ,m(s,t) [0.1] Indicator traffic is monitored g(s,t),a (s, t) AM , a A, g(s,t),a 0 Shortest path flow x(s,t),i (s, t) AM , i N\\\\N0 Shortest path dual values The assumption will be that attacks may choose to disable any node it attacks, or leave them functioning. Attacks could be modeled with Big M flow constraints, in this case, since any node may be attacked. However, the shortest path calculations would be expected to dominate the order of the size of the problem, this model will stick with the Steiner formulation. A Big M coefficient would be at the head of the binary decision dependencies and could cause pseudo randomness in traditional means of finding solutions. Shortest path calculations pose an issue, since shortest path must be en- forced while the objective functions run counter to the network adhering to the condition. As such, each shortest path will be modeled with both the primal and dual versions for enforcement. Before getting to the model, some discussion is required regarding the pri- mal/dual formulations of shortest path. Using the defined parameters and for some s, t N\\\\N0, and a vector h {1.0.1}\\n|N\\\\N0|, where hs = 1, ht = 1 and hi = 0 otherwise, the primal formulation of the shortest path from s to t is min 1Tg (19) s.t.\\n (j,i)A,j 6N0 g(j,i) \\n (i,j)A,j 6N0 g(i,j) = hi i N\\\\N0 g 0 The variable g can be assumed to be binary. The resulting dual problem is max xt xs (20) xj xi 1 i, j N\\\\N0 : (i, j) A (21) A primary problem in implementing shortest path as a way to model network traffic is that attacked nodes need to be removed form the internal formulation. Moreover, the resulting problem could be infeasible. Both cases must be han- dled. The case that the resulting problem becomes infeasible First, consider the new shortest path formulation when nodes V = {i N\\\\{N0 {s, t}} : wi = 1} are removed. The resulting primal formulation is 18 min 1Tg (22) s.t.\\n (j,i)A,j 6{N0V } g(j,i) \\n (i,j)A,j 6{N0V } g(i,j) = hi i N\\\\{N0 V } g(i,j) 0 (i, j) A : i, j N\\\\{N0 V } To convert model 19 to model 22 using w as a variable, the constraints g(i,j) + wi 1 i, j N\\\\N0 : (i, j) A g(i,j) + wj 1 i, j N\\\\N0 : (i, j) A can be applied and note that on deleted constraints on associated attacked nodes trivially equal 0. The modified dual is max xt xs (23) xj xi 1 i, j N\\\\{N0 V } : (i, j) A To convert model 20 to model 23 using w as a variable, the constraints on attacked nodes need to be removed. The constraints can be modified by adding a Big M reduction xj xi |N\\\\N0|(wi + wj) 1 i, j N\\\\N0 : (i, j) A where it is known the longest shortest path is limited by the nodes in N\\\\N0. These modifications leave the case where the resulting shortest path is in- feasible, either due to s or t being attacked or s and t having a cut set being attacked. One workaround, used here, is to modify h using m(s,t). The premise is that shortest path will only be calculated if m(s,t) = 1, that is the network traffic passes through an observer. If the s, t pair is cut or the shortest path is not incident with an observer, m(s,t) will be forced to 0 and make the primal/dual trivial with 0 solutions. These modifications can be made by setting hs = m(s,t) ht = m(s,t) and then requiring that some observer be incident to the path with (i,j)A:i,jN\\\\N0,iNM or jNM g(i,j) m(s,t) 0 and then requiring primal/dual equality with 1Tg (xt xs) = 0 19 . These shortest path models must be done for each (s, t) AM . The proposed overall model will additionally trim some unnecessary variables out which are always 0 due to optimality conditions. The assumption made on the model that any monitored path is lexicograph- ically longer than an unmonitored path of the same length is not explicitly modeled. Perturbations on the primal/dual of the shortest path sub-models easily achieve this. The proposed model following combines the Steiner Attack formulation with a new functional decision tree objective and the discussed shortest path sub models for each (s, t) AM . 20 min moeopr(w),moeobs(m) (24) s.t. cTp b (25)\\n (n0,j)A:n0N0 uk,(n0,j) wk = 0 k N\\\\N0 (26)\\n (i,k)A uk,(i,k) wk = 0 k N\\\\N0 (27)\\n (j,i)A uk,(j,i) \\n (i,j)A uk,(i,j) = 0 k N\\\\N0,i N : i 6 N0, i 6= k (28) uk,a pa 0 k N\\\\N0,a A (29)\\n (s,j)A,j 6N0 g(s,t),(s,j) m(s,t) = 0 (s, t) AM (30)\\n (i,t)A,i6N0 g(s,t),(i,t) m(s,t) = 0 (s, t) AM (31)\\n (j,i)A,j 6N0 g(s,t),(j,i) \\n (i,j)A,j 6N0 g(s,t),(i,j) = 0 (s, t) AM ,i N\\\\{N0 {s, t}} (32)\\n (i,j)A:i,jN\\\\N0,iNM or jNM g(s,t),(i,j) m(s,t) 0 (s, t) AM (33) g(s,t),(i,j) + wi 1 (s, t) AM ,i, j N\\\\N0 : (i, j) A (34) g(s,t),(i,j) + wj 1 (s, t) AM ,i, j N\\\\N0 : (i, j) A (35) x(s,t),j x(s,t),i |N\\\\N0|(vi + vj) 1 (s, t) AM ,i, j N\\\\N0 : (i, j) A (36) 1Tg(s,t) (x(s,t),t x(s,t),s) = 0 (s, t) AM\\n(37) p {0, 1}|A| (38) u {0, 1}|N\\\\N0||A| (39) v {0, 1}|N\\\\N0| (40) m {0, 1}|AM | (41) g 0 (42) 21 The objective function now has two functional decision trees. Constraints 25,26,27,28,29 are from Steiner Attack. Constraints 30,31,32 are similar path constraints, requiring traffic that is observed have a flow of one from the sender to the receiver. Constraint 33 requires observed traffic be incident with some observer. Constraints 34,35 prohibits network traffic from using a disabled node. Constraints 36,37 form the duals for the shortest paths, enforcing that shortest paths are simple, shortest paths. Constraint 37 has a Big M coefficient to trivialize constraints that should not be in the dual due nodes being disabled. 22 \",",
