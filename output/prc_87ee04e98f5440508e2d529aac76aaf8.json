  "text": "value over the course of an approach and a WSL that initially did not apply for \\ncertain aircraft (see Figure 4-6). Several questions were then related to their ability to provide \\nseparation with respect to these limits. The first part of the hypothesis, acceptability, was measured by controller responses to the \\nfollowing Day 1-2 post-run (QT1) question: I could easily assess whether the IM Trail Aircraft \\nwould remain behind the CSL during the approach. As described in Section 5.5.3.1, All Week 2-\\n3 TRACON controllers agreed for both monitor configurations and for All IM PA Tools On and All \\nIM PA Tools Off. The same question was asked with respect to the WSL: I could easily assess whether the IM \\nTrail Aircraft would remain forward of the WSL during the approach, when applicable. \\nAlthough, as described in Section 5.5.3.2, all Week 2-3 TRACON controllers agreed for the \\nCombined Monitor position with IM PA Tools On, a majority (86%) agreed for the Combined \\nMonitor position with IM PA Tools Off. To examine whether there was a statistically significant difference between the CSL and WSL \\nresponses for this question, a three-factor ANOVA test was performed on the Week 2-3 \\nTRACON controller post-run data with respect to safety limit (CSL versus WSL), Monitor \\nconfiguration (Combined versus Separate [28R]), and IM PA Tool configuration (On \\nversus Off). The probability of finding an effect when there was none, alpha (), was set \\nto 0.05. The descriptive statistics (n, M, and variance) for the three main factors are \\nshown in Table 5-72. The ANOVA results are shown in Table 5-73. Table 5-72.

No statistically significant differences were observed \\nbetween Monitor and IM PA Tool configurations or any of the factor combinations. The unanimous agreement for the CSL suggests controller participants did not have an issue \\nwith it changing over the course of the approach. However, the WSL did appear to increase the \\ndifficulty of the monitoring task. Given that no significant difference was found in IM PA Tool \\nconfiguration, the challenge was likely due to the CSL being displayed from the start of the \\noperation versus the WSL only becoming active late in the operation. Therefore, a Pre-\\nActivation feature that starts sooner than that implemented in the HITL would provide \\ncontrollers more information about what to expect and therefore likely reduce the challenge of \\nmonitoring with respect to the WSL. This is consistent with participant comments as reported in \\nSection 5.5.3.2. --------------------------------- The second part of the hypothesis, feasibility, was measured by controller responses to the \\nfollowing Day 2 end (QT3) question: Overall, I was confident that I could assess whether the \\nseparation between the IM Trail Aircraft and their Lead Aircraft would be maintained. As \\ndescribed in Section 5.2.5, the majority (80%) of TRACON controllers agreed. This self-\\nassessment was supported by the objective separation analysis in Section 5.2.5.2, which found \\nonly a single instance of a within-pair IM PA separation violation. Conclusion: This hypothesis is supported by the simulation results. Overall, controllers found it \\nacceptable and feasible to provide PA separation with respect to separation values that change \\nover the course of an approach, given an appropriate tool set. This did not appear to be affected \\nby monitor configuration. H3(RQ3): Controllers will find a WSL Pre-Activation indication and distances to 6.8.3\\nthe CSL and WSL useful, but not minimum requirements. The first part of this hypothesis was measured via responses to questions related to usefulness \\nof the WSL-P and WSL Data Block W features. At the end of Day 2 (QT3) controllers were \\nasked if the WSL-P was useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task. As described in Section \\n5.5.3.2, all (100%) TRACON controllers agreed. In the same questionnaire, half (50%) felt the \\nWSL-P should always be on and half felt that it should be user toggleable (Figure 5-69) for the \\nIM PA monitoring task. Two controllers indicated in comments that aircraft type differences cxi\\n would indicate an active WSL to the controller, which suggests that though helpful, the WSL-P \\nmay be an optional feature. When asked in the same questionnaire if the WSL Pre-Active Indication (W) features were \\nuseful for the overall IM PA monitoring task, TRACON controller responses were variable and a \\nmajority (70%) of TRACON controllers disagreed it was useful, as described in Section 5.5.3.2. To determine if there was a statistically significant difference between controller responses to \\nthe two display elements, a paired-sample T-Test analysis was run on the TRACON controller \\nagreement ratings for the following two questions: The WSL-P was useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task.\\nThe WSL Pre-Active Indication (W) features were useful for the overall IM PA \\nmonitoring task. The descriptive statistics (n, M, and SD) for each question are shown in Table 5-43. The \\nprobability of finding an effect when there was none, alpha (), was set to 0.05. The \\nresults of the two-tailed, paired sample T-Test analysis resulted in a statistically \\nsignificant p = 0.0002. This suggests a significant difference in controller agreement for \\nthe usefulness of the two elements, with controllers appearing to prefer the WSL-P \\ninstead of the WSL Pre-Active Indication (W) feature in the data block. --------------------------------- The second part of this hypothesis was measured via responses to questions related to \\nusefulness of the CSL and WSL Data Block Distance feature. At the end of Day 2 (QT3) \\ncontrollers were asked if the Data Block Distance to CSL was useful for the overall IM PA \\nmonitoring task. As described in Section 5.5.3.1, all but two controllers disagreed. In the same \\nquestionnaire, four of ten controllers rated it as not needed and the others suggested it should \\nbe user toggleable (Figure 5-69) for the IM PA monitoring task. The same question was asked with respect to the WSL Data Block Distance feature: if the Data \\nBlock Distance to WSL was useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task. As described in \\nSection 5.5.3.2, all but two controllers disagreed. In the same questionnaire, four of ten \\ncontrollers rated it as not needed and the others suggested it should be user toggleable (Figure \\n5-69) for the IM PA monitoring task. Conclusion: This hypothesis is partially supported by the simulation results. Controllers did \\nappear to find the WSL-P useful, but not a minimum requirement. However, controllers did not \\nappear to find the Data Block W Indication useful. Almost all controllers also rated the Data \\nBlock Distances to the CSL and WSL as not useful, at least to them. H4(RQ3): A representation of the safety limits and an alert when the IM Trail 6.8.4\\nAircraft begins to encroach on the limits will be useful to Monitor controllers. The first part of this hypothesis was measured via responses to questions related to the \\nusefulness of the safety limit features. As described in Section 5.5.3.1, at the end of Day 2 (QT3) \\nall (100%) TRACON controllers found the CSL Line useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task. \\nIn the same questionnaire, all controllers recommended that the CSL Line always be on (Figure cxii\\n 5-69) for the monitoring task. The results were the same for the WSL Line, as described in \\nSection 5.5.3.2 and Figure 5-69. --------------------------------- The second part of this hypothesis was measured via responses to questions related to \\nusefulness of the longitudinal alerting features. Results were examined with respect to the two \\nlevels of longitudinal alert presented in the HITL experiment: the Predictive Alert and the \\nCaution Alert. As described in Section 4.2.7, controllers were only required to take action in \\nresponse to the Caution Alert. At the end of Day 2 (QT3) controllers were asked if the IM PA Predictive Alert and IM PA \\nCaution Alert features were useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task. As described in \\nSection 5.5.4.1, all (100%) TRACON controllers agreed for the Caution Alert and a majority (90%) \\nagreed for the Predictive Alert. In the same questionnaire, a majority of TRACON controllers \\n(90%) responded that the Predictive and Caution Alerts should always be on (Figure 5-69)",
