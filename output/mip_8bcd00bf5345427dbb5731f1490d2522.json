  "text": "was easier for the CSL than the WSL. This hypothesis was further supported by the \\nseparation violation analysis, in which only a single aircraft was observed to exceed one of the \\nsafety limits. WSL Monitoring and Preview. Though a CSL always applies and is displayed from the start of \\nthe operation through landing, the WSL requirement may depend on facility and approach \\ngeometry, wake class pairings, and prevailing crosswinds. Even in conditions where a WSL is \\nrequired, it may not apply until the last portion of the approach. This can complicate IM PA \\nMonitoring as it reduces controller certainty with respect to: when a WSL is required for an IM \\nPA Pair, where it will start to apply, and the IM Trail Aircrafts proximity to it at the time it \\nbecomes active. Therefore, there is the potential for controllers to be surprised by a WSL \\nsuddenly popping up on the display. Two WSL Pre-Activation display features designed to reduce this uncertainty were evaluated. \\nFirst, a WSL-P was implemented to provide an advance indication of where the WSL will appear \\nwhen it becomes active. It was represented by a grey line at the location where the WSL would \\neventually appear and was first displayed when the IM Trail Aircraft was approximately 7 NM \\nfrom the runway threshold. Second, Line 3 in the data block displayed a W with no \\ncorresponding numeric value in cases where a WSL would eventually apply, but was not yet \\nactive. The availability of these two features was varied as levels of an independent variable. It was hypothesized that one feature would be required by controllers, but not both. However, \\nthe underlying WSL may become predictable over time and this additional display feature could \\npossibly be considered display clutter by controllers. It was therefore hypothesized that one \\nor both of these features may be useful, but not a minimum requirement. Controller uncertainty regarding WSL separation was reflected in various results. Though they \\nusually agreed the overall separation task was acceptable with respect to both limits, they \\nappeared to agree more strongly with respect to the CSL than the WSL, regardless of which IM \\nPA Tools were available. Across their various responses and consistent with the hypothesis, \\ncontrollers reported that the WSL-P was helpful for the overall IM PA monitoring task, but that \\nthe Data Block W Indication was not. Given the increased variability in the WSL monitoring \\nresponses, a WSL-P feature that starts sooner than that implemented in the HITL may reduce \\nthe challenge of monitoring with respect to the WSL. The desire for an earlier WSL-P display was \\nreflected in several question responses and controller comments. vi\\n When deciding whether to display the WSL-P earlier in the operation, it should be considered \\nthat at greater groundspeed differentials between the IM Trail Aircraft and IM Lead Aircraft, the \\nWSL-P can first appear in front of the IM Trail Aircrafts current position. Then, as the IM Trail \\nAircraft catches up, it crosses over the WSL-P. It is possible that this may prove confusing and \\nundesirable to controllers. This case was included in the scenarios and no participant controllers \\nnoted any concerns in the responses, comments, or debrief discussion. However, the earlier a \\nWSL-P is displayed, the further behind it an IM Trail Aircraft may appear. This could eventually \\nbecome confusing and counterproductive to the monitoring task. This is an area that would \\nbenefit from further evaluation. Longitudinal Alerting. As IM PA intra-pair spacing will be smaller than what controllers are used \\nto today, and because the controller will be required to take action before an IM PA Aircraft \\nlongitudinally encroaches on either the WSL or CSL, it is expected that alerting will be helpful to \\ncontrollers to indicate when an intervention is required. Therefore, the IM PA alerts indicated to \\nthe controller when: 1) an IM Trail Aircraft was potentially at risk of encroaching on either of the \\nsafety limits (IM PA Predictive Alert), and 2) when the controller must take an action (e.g., \\naircraft breakout) to maintain separation (IM PA Caution Alert). The two alert types shared the \\nsame logic; only the timing values were different. Based on the fielded ATPA Phase 1 alert \\nimplementation, it was hypothesized that a similar IM PA two-level alerting scheme would be \\nacceptable to controllers. This hypothesis is supported by the simulation results. Controllers generally found that the \\nPredictive and Caution Alerts were useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task and suggested \\nthey should always be active. Responses were stronger for the Caution Alert than the Predictive \\nAlert. On average the controllers agreed: they wanted to be able to see a situation developing \\nversus only being provided an alert when they had to take action; the IM PA-related tools \\nallowed for a timely detection of any impending exceedance of the WSL or CSL or spacing or \\nseparation issues; and their responsibilities with respect to a both alert types were clear. With \\nrespect to display implementation, they appeared to find both the data block line 3 and \\nCSL/WSL Line color changes helpful. The default Predictive / Caution alert timings were the same as those implemented for ATPA: 45 \\nseconds and 24 seconds, respectively. However, reduced timings may ultimately be used to \\nmitigate against nuisance alerts (which would occur more frequently with greater timings). \\nTherefore, two additional alert timings were investigated in the HITL to examine whether \\nsmaller values than those chosen for ATPA remain acceptable to controllers for the IM PA \\nmonitoring task. These were: 35 seconds / 20 seconds and 25 seconds / 15 seconds, for the \\nPredictive and Caution Alerts, respectively. The controllers found both alert types to be effective in providing sufficient advance notice \\nacross all of the evaluated alert timing values and no significant difference was observed \\nbetween average controller response times for any of the timings. The majority of Week \\n2-3 TRACON controllers reported preferring a 35 second value for the Predictive Alert \\nwith respect to both safety limits, and a 15 or 20 second value for the Caution Alert. This \\nsuggests that the default ATPA alert timing value of 45/24 sec could possibly be \\nacceptably decreased; however, responses also suggested that the 25/15 sec alert timing vii\\n value was the most difficult for controllers to assess whether the IM PA Trail Aircraft \\nwould remain behind the CSL and forward of the WSL. Further research is recommended \\nin this area to optimize the balance between nuisance alerts and the time available to \\ntake action once an alert is triggered. Participant discussions suggested a potentially confusing consequence from how the alerts \\nwere designed to be time-based and dependent upon ground speed matching. \\nDepending on the speed differences, an alert may not be displayed even if an aircraft \\nwas a very short distance to the limit. Then, if there was a sudden change in the ground \\nspeed differential between an IM Lead and Trail Aircraft, a Caution Alert could be \\ntriggered without a preceding Predictive Alert. Though this behavior was explained to \\nthe participants, it still appeared to require some experience with the operations and \\nalerts to understand why an aircraft could be physically very close to a limit without a \\ncorresponding alert, or to have a Caution Alert suddenly appear. Strategies for \\nminimizing the potential for confusion or sudden state changes should be considered in \\nthe further design of the IM PA alerting. Longitudinal Alert Response Procedures. Further discussion and open-ended comments \\nsuggested that controllers desired more manual control to resolve a situation when it \\nbecame clear via speed differences or a Predictive Alert that an aircraft was going to \\nencroach upon a safety limit. Several controllers expressed frustration that they were \\nunable to manually issue a speed to keep an IM Trail Aircraft within the limits. This was \\nbecause issuing a speed to an IM Trail Aircraft terminates the FIM Equipment-generated \\nspeeds, and the HITL procedure when that happened was to issue a go-around to the \\ntrail. Although it is assumed that the PA separation standard will be designed to not \\nrequire IM and FIM Equipment-generated IM Speeds, this HITL procedure was \\nimplemented because it seemed unlikely that controllers would be willing to manually \\nissue speeds to keep the aircraft within limits due to their workload and other tasking. Several controllers, however, expressed a strong desire to manually provide speeds to the \\nIM Trail Aircraft when they observed a spacing situation start to develop. It was \\nacceptable to them to keep the aircraft within the safety limits for the remainder of the \\napproach and save a go-around. One instance was observed in which a controller \\nattempted to do this, but was unsuccessful. This, and five observed instances of safety \\nlimit crossings that were not counted as violations due to a PTT click before the aircraft \\npassed the line, occurred with the shortest alert timing values (25/15 sec). The average \\ncontroller PTT response before each crossing was 10.8 seconds (SD = 3.6). If a future PA \\nseparation standard would allow controllers to manually manage Trail Aircraft speeds,",
