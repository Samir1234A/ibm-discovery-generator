Ultimately, a public-private partnership could increase the likelihood of an NTCs longevity and allow scalability as new testing demands are recognized. Per discussions with stakeholders, past federal efforts did not consider this aspect early in the development and implementation phases. \\nBarriers and Facilitators to the Development, Implementation, Sustainability, Governance, and Scalability of an NTC\\nIn order to develop, implement, sustain, govern, and scale an NTC, it will be important to consider the barriers that might exist, as well as the potential facilitators. This section details these barriers and facilitators. \\nNTC Establishment\\nBarriers to Establishment\\nThe barriers to the establishment of an NTC include the following:\\nLack of stakeholder engagement and buy-in to the proposal due to concerns about scale of the proposal, protection of PHI, return on investment for test executors, and effects on clinical workflow\\nLack of meaningful incentives for participants\\nComplexity of developing legal agreements and mechanisms that will adequately protect PHI if data are exchanged outside of a clinical providers EHR environment\\nCompeting priorities among stakeholders for which use cases to establish first \\nAcquiring enough funding to establish an NTC and fund it on an ongoing basis\\nSecuring arrangements with, and engaging enough, diverse EHR and other health IT developers, clinical providers, patients, and potentially other types of participants to allow thorough assessment of health IT applications, including of edge use cases\\nDeveloping pre-defined patient cohorts for each use case\\nFacilitators to Establishment\\nActivities that would facilitate the establishment of an NTC include the following:\\nEngaging a diverse group of stakeholders at an NTC concept development phase\\nBuilding on existing health IT infrastructure at clinical sites\\nConsidering a top down approach within Health and Human Services (HHS) to ensure traction for the effort at the highest level of leadership \\nApplying a phased approach to the introduction of use cases \\nProviding frequent feedback to stakeholders about the advances of an NTC\\nAllocating government funding for the piloting phase of an NTC \\nEngaging many diverse types of clinical practices\\nIncentivizing participants of an NTC\\nApplying standard processes to address legal issues related to PHI use (e.g., HHS IRB pre-approved forms, TEFCA)\\nBuilding on lessons learned from previous attempts to use real-world data to test health IT applications\\nUtilizing the IDIQ vehicle established by AHRQs ACTION network\\nEngaging patients and patient advocates to learn how an NTC could support their needs\\nNTC Implementation\\nBarriers to Implementation\\nThe barriers to the implementation of an NTC include the following:\\nDifficulties maintaining stakeholder engagement\\nSecuring funds for expansion and maintenance of an NTC \\nEnsuring PHI requirements are met (e.g., IRB approval for research projects)\\nAddressing lack of interoperability across systems\\nDeveloping patient cohorts for each use case\\nFacilitators of Implementation\\nActivities that would facilitate the implementation of an NTC include the following:\\nProviding frequent feedback to NTC participants \\nLeveraging ONC efforts to implement the 10-Year Interoperability Roadmap[endnoteRef:26] [26: ONC, Connecting Health and Care for the Nation: A Shared Nationwide Interoperability Roadmap, [Online].

As described, prior efforts in this space failed to become viable options; some of the factors cited as reasons for these failuresinsufficient early stakeholder engagement and lack of consensus among stakeholders; the associated time requirements and opportunity costs for participants; the challenges associated with legal and technical aspects of privacy, security, and data sharing; and lack of development of a sustainable business model early in the development and implementation phasesare key areas that must be addressed and have solutions in place to build a viable NTC. Critical building blocks will include the following: organizing a multi-disciplinary stakeholder group for governance, developing incentives that induce participation, developing solutions for PHI protection and data sharing agreements, and securing a stable funding source to help build a sustainable infrastructure. \\nBased upon this initial analysis, the Health FFRDC recommends the actions listed in the following section to further the goal of establishing an NTC. \\nRecommendations\\nThe following recommendations were generated as part of this analysis regarding next steps to achieve the NTC.\\nConduct a thorough assessment of prior efforts to develop scalable real-world testbeds and tools, including landscape analyses and data calls for information generated from prior efforts to understand the root cause of failed efforts.\\nEngage stakeholders to determine stakeholder interests, needs, expectations, and level of interest/influence. This will assist in targeting key stakeholders given limited resources.\\nIdentify and engage with interested stakeholders from the critical stakeholder list to form a governance group; consider engaging HHS stakeholders at all organizational levels (i.e., from executive to staff level) to create more visibility and buy-in for an NTC.\\nEngage with stakeholders from AHRQs ACTION network to assess the viability of building on their contracting mechanism through the possible inclusion of additional and NTC-relevant organizations.\\nDevelop an incentive plan to engage participants. Leverage this plan to develop a summary document for participants and other stakeholders to understand how they may benefit from participation in an NTC.\\nDevelop a vetting and triage checklist to assess potential participants.\\nPlan the implementation of an NTC as a phased approach, starting with a pilot, to ensure opportunities to build on lessons learned at each implementation phase.\\nDevelop a business plan that will ensure sustainability of an NTC (e.g., public-private partnership).
