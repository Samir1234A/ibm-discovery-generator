  "text": "the physical implementation of a typical BB84 fiber-based system with polarization encoding. In such a system, the quantum state of photons transmitted by Alice is typically measured by Bob by routing the photons through a series of beamsplitters (non-polarizing and polarizing) and additional optics such that a photon in one of the four polarization states used is ultimately detected by a photodetector (out of four total) that is associated with that polarization state. Hence, when Bob receives a signal from a photodetector associated with a certain polarization state, he knows that he has received a photon in that polarization state. Figure 1 shows a typical BB84 receiver that achieves this measurement of the photon state. It consists of two arms, each with two single photon detectors. Each arm is associated with one of the two BB84 bases (HV or AD), and is responsible for measuring photons in its basis. The 50-50 beamsplitter that connects the two arms performs the step of randomly choosing the basis for Bob by sending the incoming photons into either the HV or the AD arm with equal probabilities. If the photon travels straight through the first beamsplitter, it enters the HV arm and Bob is measuring in this basis. The measurement process begins when the photon passes through a polarizing beamsplitter that directs the photon according to its polarization. For example, an H polarized photon continues straight through and is detected by an avalanche photodiode (APD), a common type of photodetector. Thus, when Bob sees this specific APD fire, he knows that he has chosen the HV basis, and the result of his measurement was H (which can be translated to a bit value). Similarly, a V polarized photon gets deflected by the polarizing beamsplitter and is directed into the second APD in the HV arm, registering as a V measurement. Most commercial fiber-based QKD systems actually employ alternative encoding schemes due to the susceptibility of the polarization states to disturbances from birefringence and other environmental effects that are difficult to manage outside of the laboratory setting [22]. 8 Figure 1: Schematic of a typical BB84 receiver layout. Figure credit: Stephen Pappas, MITRE & Colin Lualdi. On the other hand, if the photon is directed into the second measurement arm by the first beamsplitter, then Bob is measuring in the AD basis. As the beamsplitters measure in the HV basis, Bob needs to first rotate the polarization of the incoming AD photon by /4 using a half-wave plate (HWP) so that a D photon becomes an H photon and an A photon becomes a V photon. The remainder of the measurement process is the same as in the HV arm except that when one of those APDs fires, Bob knows he is measuring in the AD basis and records an A measurement for one and a D for the other. Those APDs have a design flaw that could serve as a source of information leakage. First pointed out by Kurtsiefer et al., this attack relies on the curious fact that avalanche photodiodes are known to emit backflash photons upon photonic stimulation due to the physics of those detectors [6]. Their operating principle lies in the use of a semiconductor p-n junction. Prior to single photon detection, the reverse bias voltage of the p-n junction is raised to a breakdown voltage Vb. At this voltage, absorption by even a single photon is sufficient to create carriers in the conduction band of the diode, which can then trigger an avalanche process, creating a measurable current in the milliamp range indicating photon detection. Different semiconductor materials are used for photons of different wavelengths. Silicon (Si) APDs are most sensitive to wavelengths in the 400-1000 nm range (ideal for laboratory 9 experiments), while alternative semiconductor materials such as indium gallium arsenide are well suited for telecommunication wavelengths of 1300 nm or 1550 nm (ideal for long distance transmission). When photons strike the semiconductor material, they cause electron excitations, creating electron-hole pairs. The electrons function as charge carriers (i.e. hot carriers or free carriers) and multiply, causing the avalanche. Interestingly, a photoemission also occurs as a result of those avalanches. Explanations for those photoemissions are varied and include radiative electron-hole recombination and carrier energy relaxation (direct, phonon- assisted, or Bremsstrahlung) [24, 25]. Those secondary photons may be either absorbed in a quiescent region of the semiconductor, initiating new avalanches, or they may find their way out of the detector [4]. Photons that manage to escape the detector could potentially be a source of information leakage when APDs are used in a QKD implementation. Such backflash photons could couple with the optical fiber leading into the APDs, find their way through Bobs QKD receiver, and out into the quantum channel traveling in the opposite direction of the incident photons from Alice. An eavesdropper could then discreetly siphon off the backflash photons, leaving the original photons untouched. If those backflash photons carry meaningful information corresponding to the information carried by the original photons, Eve could potentially perform measurements on her backflash photons to gain information about the results of Bobs measurements and, in extension, the secret key. Since the creation of backflash photons is a random process, Alice and Bob have no knowledge of or control over photons that escape Bobs receiver. Thus, this attack allows Eve to obtain copies of the photons used by Alice and Bob without their knowledge, and thus leave the QBER unaffected. Consequently, this represents a dangerous potential QKD vulnerability. 5 Demonstration of Information Leakage from APD Backflashes We consider the hypothetical attack scenario shown in Figure 2. Alice and Bob are using a fiber-based BB84 QKD implementation with polarization encoding. It is assumed that Eve has full access to all classical communica- tions between Alice and Bob. We also propose that Eve is able to tap into the quantum channel, perhaps with the use of an optical circulator. This would allow all the photons sent by Alice to Bob to travel uninterrupted, but diverts to Eve the backflash photons traveling in the opposite direction. 10 Figure 2: Overview of a potential QKD attack exploiting APD backflash emission. Due to the design of the BB84 receiver (see Figure 1), all backflash photons acquire specific polarization information as they exit their originating APD and travel through a sequence of polarizing beamsplitters and half-wave plates. For instance, APD1, being parallel to its polarizing beamsplitter, is responsible for measuring H-polarized photons. Therefore, when backflash photons exit APD1, they return through the polarizing beamsplitter where onlyH light is transmitted, and photons of different polarizations are reflected and lost. Those H photons then reach the main beamsplitter, where half of them are transmitted through to the quantum channel and the other half are lost. A similar process occurs with the remaining APDs: backflashes from APD2 reach the quantum channel as V photons and APDs 3 and 4 also produce D and A-polarized backflashes, respectively, as they exit the polarizing beamsplitter and half-wave plate set to 45 degrees. It is important to emphasize that there is no direct coherence, classical or quantum, between the incident photons from Alice and the backflash photons. This is because the original photon is completely destroyed in the measurement process within the APDs. The resulting backflash creates a pulse of light that is created simply as a result of hot carrier relaxation. However, as those backflashes exit the BB84 receiver, the key polarization information is imprinted onto them by the various optical elements used. Additionally, a single QKD photon may create many backflash photons, allowing Eve to measure the polarization of the QKD signal with very high fidelity. 11 Figure 3: Schematic of the experiment setup used by the authors to investigate BB84 backflashes. 5.1 Experimental Apparatus Figure 3 provides an overview of the experimental setup. A function generator acts as a pulse generator and serves as the timekeeper for the entire apparatus by setting the reference time. It triggers a 850 nm pulsed diode laser. A variable attenuator significantly reduces the lasers power so that it generates faint pulses in an approximation of a single photon source. The resulting photons are then directed through a linear polarizer set to 45 degrees with respect to the fast and slow axes of the immediately following quarter wave plate. This transforms the incoming photons into circular polarization. This is necessary in order to ensure the balanced distribution of all incoming photons among the four BB84 detectors as polarized beamsplitters evenly split circularly polarized light. The photons then pass through a neutral density (ND) filter with an optical density of 3.0 rotated 20 degrees off the beam axis and then routed to the BB84 receiver (see Figure 1 for details). Each BB84 measurement port contains a Si APD for photodetection. Some of the secondary photons resulting from the avalanches within those APDs manage to escape into the BB84 receiver, becoming backflash photons. A portion of those photons then exit the BB84 receiver (purple beam in Figure 3) and find their way",
