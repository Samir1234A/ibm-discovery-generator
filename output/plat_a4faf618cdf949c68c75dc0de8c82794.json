  "text": "useful (M=81.8; SD=20.1). However, pilot responses were variable as to whether\\nit was a minimum requirement (M=59.2; SD=30.3). Pilots were then asked whether the\\ngraphical progress indicator was unnecessary. Responses were variable (M=59.3; SD=31.8). The following was captured in comments made to the observer, or were in notes from the\\nobserver. The graphical progress indicator was generally preferred (over only the ASG and SI) to\\ndetermine whether or not the ASG would be achieved or maintained. Without the graphical\\nprogress indicator, pilots had no clear information on the tolerances. Even with the graphical\\nprogress indicator, the situation could change as the operation evolved. A situation that was, at\\none point, out of tolerance, could get within tolerance at a future point. Pilots wanted clear\\nguidance from the avionics on when to report unable interval spacing. Pilot responses were variable about whether the speed tape was useful (M=59.3; SD=31.8).\\nThree pilots commented that they wanted it on or near the PFD. The responses were variable\\nas to whether it was a minimum requirement (M=32.9; SD=27.6), though the majority\\ndisagreed that it was a minimum requirement (13/18; 72%). Figure 4-65 depicts these results. Figure 4-65. Summary of Pilot Responses on Min+ Display Element Statements 4-75 In the post-scenario questionnaire, pilots were asked whether they had the necessary display\\nelements to conduct IM. Table 4-45 and Figure 4-66 shows pilots, on average, agreed,\\nregardless of role or tool set. As mentioned in Section 4.1.3, a statistical test was run on this\\nmeasure and no statistically significant difference was found. Table 4-45.

Pilot Responses to Post-Scenario Statement I had the necessary display\\nelements for conducting IM 4-76 The majority of pilots reported the min (13/18; 72%) and the min+ (16/18; 89%)\\nimplementations included all the necessary information to conduct IM (Figure 4-67). Figure 4-67. Pilot Responses to Did the combination of both the AGD and CDTI\\nimplementations include all the information necessary for you to conduct IM? The majority of pilots reported that no display elements were confusing or misleading on\\nneither the AGD (16/18; 89%) or CDTI traffic display (17/17; 100%; missing=1) (Figure 4-68). The\\nreports of misleading information appeared to be due to initial misunderstandings or\\nsimulation issues (e.g., didnt understand the box at first), not on-going issues. Figure 4-68. Pilot Responses to Did you find any elements on the displays to be confusing or\\nmisleading? 4-77 Pilots reported being able to focus more on the AGD than the CDTI. The PFs reported spending\\n83% of their time on the AGD while the PMs reported spending 67% of their time on the AGD\\n(Figure 4-69). Figure 4-69. Pilot Responses to Considering total time on the IM displays, estimate the total\\npercentage of time using each display 4-78 The majority (17/18; 94%) of pilots reported being able to perform IM by primarily focusing on\\nthe AGD (M=87.4; SD=14.1). When asked if they could integrate the displays into their normal\\nscan, the majority (16/18; 89%) of the pilots agreed for the AGD (M= 75.1; SD=27.1) but the\\nresponses were variable for the CDTI (M=54.6; SD=32.8). The majority (16/18; 89%) of the pilots\\nagreed that the necessary scan time was acceptable (M=74.4; SD=24.4). Pilot responses were\\nvariable (M=63.7; SD=30.1), but the majority (13/18; 72%) agreed that the amount of head\\ndown time was acceptable. Figure 4-70 depicts these results. Figure 4-70. Summary of Pilot Responses on the Instrument Scan 4-79 Pilot were asked whether the display combination was acceptable for the CDTI states of\\nclearance entry, entry evaluation, and execution. The majority of pilots agreed for all states. Clearance (awaiting) entry (15/18; 83%) (M= 79.1; SD= 23.7) Entry evaluation / cross flight deck coordination (16/18; 89%) (M= 83.4; SD= 18.5) Execution / IM conduct without graphical progress indicator (15/18; 83%) (M= 69.3; SD=\\n23.1) Execution / IM conduct with graphical progress indicator (16/18; 89%) (M= 83.0; SD=\\n18.9) For the awaiting entry state, the research observer noted that participants often chose to type\\nin the lead aircraft identification instead of selecting the lead aircraft and having the field\\nautomatically populated (as described in Section 3.1.1.2). This appeared to be due to the\\ndifficulty / burden associated with finding the lead aircraft on the CDTI traffic display. Finally, when asked if they would be willing to perform IM with the tested displays, the majority\\n(16/18; 89%) agreed for both the minimum (M= 74.9; SD=22.3) and the minimum+ (M= 79.1;\\nSD=25.5) implementations. Figure 4-71 depicts the results. As would be expected, pilot comments included ones stating a preference for having the IM\\ninformation integrated into the PFD and navigation display. Figure 4-71. Summary of Pilot Responses to Display Acceptability Statements 4-80 4.8 Roles and Responsibilities\\nParticipants were asked whether their roles and responsibilities were clear. The majority (8/9;\\n89%) of the controllers agreed for IM aircraft (M= 87.0; SD=17.8) and all controllers agreed for\\nnon-IM aircraft (M= 93.0; SD=7.9). The majority (17/18; 94%) of the pilots agreed (M= 87.1;\\nSD=19.2). Figure 4-72 depicts the results. Figure 4-72. Summary of Controller and Pilot Responses on Role and Responsibilities\\nStatements 4.9 Time on RNAV Arrival\\nWhen aircraft were conducting IM, they were on their RNAV procedure 98.2% of the time. Non-\\nIM aircraft were on their RNAV procedure 93.8% of the time. IM aircraft were off the RNAV\\npath on average 222.2 seconds (SD=187.0) and non-IM aircraft for 317.7 seconds (SD=182.0)\\n(Table 4-46). As can be seen, less time was spent off the RNAV path for IM aircraft as compared\\nto non-IM aircraft. Table 4-46.

The majority (7/9; 78%) of\\ncontrollers agreed for capture then maintain (M=80.4; SD=22.1) and controller responses were\\nvariable for achieve-by (M=57.9; SD=30.6) clearances. Four controllers reported wanting to\\nkeep the clearance concise. Two mentioned that data link communications would help. Participant pilots only received achieve-by clearances and the majority (16/18; 89%) agreed\\nthat they were acceptable (M=84.6; SD=27.3). The majority (16/18; 89%) of the pilots reported\\nthat the necessary information was available in the clearance to detect and select the lead\\naircraft (M=82.8; SD=22.2). Participants were asked whether the use of the lead aircraft identification in the IM clearance\\nwas acceptable. The majority (7/9; 78%) of controllers agreed (M=82.9; SD=19.9). Pilot\\nresponses were variable (M=79.4; SD=27.6) but the majority (14/17; 82%; missing=1) agreed.\\nFigure 4-73 depicts these results. Figure 4-73. Summary of Controller and Pilot Responses on Phraseology Statements 4-82 When asked whether they had any issues when the lead aircraft identification was used in\\ncommunications, the majority (8/9; 89%) of controllers and the majority (15/18; 83%) of pilots\\nreported they did not (Figure 4-74). Figure 4-74. Controller and Pilot Responses to Did you have any issues during\\ncommunications when the lead aircraft call sign was used? 4-83 4.11 En Route Initiation\\nThe main topic to examine in the simulation was controllers initiating IM in the TRACON.\\nHowever, some questions existed about receiving aircraft into the TRACON that were already\\nconducting IM. Since the en route IM initiation scenarios were outside the main set of\\nscenarios, the majority of the post-scenario results are presented separately in this section. The\\nresults are shown in Figure 4-75. Note that the post-simulation questionnaire did not\\ndistinguish between TRACON and en route initiation so the results are only from the post-\\nscenario questionnaire. In the post-scenario questionnaire, controllers, on average, agreed when there were asked\\nwhether they: Were confident the spacing of the aircraft would remain outside their separation\\nrequirement o Higher variability existed for IM aircraft for all tool sets and for non-IM aircraft for\\nthe basic+ cue tool set Could detect spacing or separation issues o Higher variability existed for IM aircraft for the basic+ cue and the basic+ cue and\\nprediction tool sets IM is operationally acceptable o Higher variability existed for IM aircraft for the basic+ cue tool set Had the necessary display elements to conduct IM o Higher variability existed for IM aircraft for the basic+ cue tool set 4-84 Figure 4-75. Controller Responses to Post-Scenario Statements on En Route Initiation 4-85 In the post-scenario questionnaire, controllers were asked to rate their average overall\\nworkload during en route initiation on the Bedford Workload Rating Scale. Figure 4-76 shows\\nthe ratings. Controllers generally found workload to be acceptable across the tool sets. Figure 4-76. Controller Responses to the Bedford Workload Rating for En Route Initiation In the post-scenario questionnaire, controllers were asked to rate their acceptability of IM\\nduring en route initiation with Controller Acceptance Rating Scale. Figure 4-77 shows the\\nratings. Controllers generally found IM operationally acceptable across the tool sets but the\\nbasic+ cue and prediction tool set average is in the improvement needed category. Figure 4-77. Controller Responses for Controller Acceptance Rating Scale for En Route\\nInitiation There were zero cases of aircraft spacing below the applicable separation and no IM\\nterminations occurred. 4-86 4.12 Simulation Assessment\\nParticipants were asked whether the training they received was adequate. All controllers\\nagreed for IM (M=93.0; SD=7.4) and TSAS / terminal metering (M=93.1; SD=7.1). The majority\\n(16/17; 94%; missing=1) of the pilots agreed (M=82.2; SD=14.0). Participants",
