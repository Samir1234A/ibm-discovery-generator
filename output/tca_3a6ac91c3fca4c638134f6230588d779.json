  "text": "the system was not\\ncorrecting (e.g., Bone et al., 2008a). However, this effect was not necessarily observed in the\\ncurrent study. The majority of pilots felt that they had a clear understanding of their spacing\\nand how well it was being achieved. This, coupled with high IM speed conformance and\\nminimal initiated speeds not issued by IM, indicated they appeared to trust the performance of\\nthe system and were not confused by the differential ground speed. As with other simulations,\\nthere were pilots that reported wanting more salient new IM speed annunciations, including\\nmentions of an aural annunciation. 2-50 2.5.2.2 Flight Deck Display Spacing Information Research Needs\\nAs can be seen from past work, much is understood about useful IM flight deck display\\nfeatures. However, some questions remain open. Key topics that still need to be resolved are\\nrelated to the necessary and appropriate spacing and trend information as well as the\\nappropriate alerting associated with IM speed changes and deviations. Appropriate alerting to IM speed changes has been challenging to specify. Some pilots have\\nexpressed a desire for aural alerting, though overall pilot feedback has been varied on whether\\naural alerting is necessary at all, and, if so, for what issue (e.g., new IM speed, deviation from\\nIM speed). There are also some concerns about the intrusiveness and the appropriateness of\\naural alerting. This is an area where further study is necessary. For the spacing and trend information, past simulations have examined different display\\nfeatures to support the flight crews in their desire to monitor the progress of and trust in the\\nIM operation. The spacing information has taken on numerous forms including: current interval\\nrelative to the ABP, projected interval at the ABP, differential ground speed, closure rate,\\nstraight-line range, etc. Past work has shown that certain information can lead to confusion, additional workload and\\nhead-down time, or lack of use. Most past work has found some analog, graphical display of\\nthis information to be most useful. Some work has been successful in specifying and requiring a\\nfeature for conveying required spacing relative to current spacing and spacing trend\\ninformation (i.e., Hoffman et al., 2006). However, other past work has continued to recommend\\n(e.g., Bone et al., 2008a; Baxley et al., 2014) a similar feature, yet the exact implementation has\\nbeen difficult to specify / develop. DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a) includes requirements and\\nrecommendations for a progress indicator that should now be considered in the design of such\\na feature. This is an area that would benefit from additional study. The past work shows that an ideal, or even reasonable minimum, implementation has been\\nchallenging to finalize. Some tools may also only be necessary for certain IM algorithms (e.g., a\\nfast / slow indicator in the NASA work). This HITL simulation will continue to study these issues by examining the minimum\\nimplementation defined in DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a) and an implementation that adds additional\\nelements to increase pilot confidence in the operation. 3-1 3 Method\\nA majority of the simulation methodology described in this section was reviewed with key FAA\\nstakeholders during the concept evaluations (reviewed in Section 2.4.2.3). Reviews of the\\nmethodology allowed the stakeholders to provide feedback that could be incorporated in the\\nfinal simulation design. After incorporating inputs, dry run testing was executed with internal\\nand external participants. Suggestions for changes from the development activities were\\nincorporated prior to data collection activities. 3.1 Simulation Environment\\nThe simulation was conducted in the MITRE IDEA Laboratory. The simulation utilized controller,\\nflight crew, and pseudo-pilot workstations from past ADS-B simulations that were modified as\\nnecessary for this effort. The following sections describe the utilized capabilities. 3.1.1 Flight Deck Workstation\\nThe flight deck simulator consisted of a typical Boeing 777 flight deck layout as shown in Figure\\n3-1. The equipment included standard elements such as a MCP, two radio management panels,\\nEICAS, a Flight Management System (FMS) with CDU interfaces, dual PFDs, and dual navigation\\ndisplays. The simulator also included a 180-degree out-the-window visual capability. New traffic\\ndisplay components were added to accommodate IM (i.e., elements on the CDTI traffic display\\nand AGD). Two CDTI traffic displays were hosted on auxiliary displays: one at the captains\\neleven oclock position and the other located at the First Officers (FOs) one oclock position.\\nThe AGD was located above the stand-by attitude indicator. The locations of the CDTI traffic\\ndisplay and AGD are shown in Figure 3-2. The utilized CDTI traffic display and AGD elements\\nwere based on requirements for ADS-B and IM (DO- 317B / RTCA, 2014, DO-361 / RTCA, 2015a).\\nMost all the requirements were met, however, some were not implemented based on the\\nexpectation that they would not be utilized in the simulation (e.g., IM turn requirements). The\\nIM algorithm utilized was specified in DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a) and is described further in Section\\n3.1.2. The flight deck IM equipment did not have an interface to the FMS or autothrottle system\\nbased on the desire to examine a near-term, retrofit implementation. The following sections\\nreview the IM implementation in detail. 3-2 Figure 3-1. Flight Deck Simulator Figure 3-2. CDTI Traffic Display and AGD Locations 3-3 3.1.1.1 CDTI\\nPer DO-317B (RTCA, 2014, p. 96), the CDTI is defined as the displays and controls necessary to\\nsupport [ADS-B In applications] \\ncontrol sub-elements. Based on that definition, the CDTI implementation in this simulation\\nconsisted of two display elements: the CDTI traffic display and the AGD. As noted previously, the IM features were based on requirements in DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a).\\nDO-361 (RTCA, 2015a) specifies five CDTI states: Awaiting entry: IM operation is not yet active but system / input interface is ready for\\nflight crew entry. Evaluate: IM information is being processed and is available for flight crew coordination\\n confirmation. Execute: IM operation is active. Suspend: IM operation is temporarily inactive. Terminate: IM operation is complete / inactive.\\nDO-361 (RTCA, 2015a) also defines over 20 information elements (e.g., IM speed, ASG, suspend\\nindication, alerts) that have different display requirements per each of the five CDTI states.\\nInformation elements are either required to be displayed, available to be displayed with simple\\naction, or required to not be displayed. Some of the information elements are required to be\\ndisplayed in the primary field of view. Other information elements are also recommended to be\\ndisplayed (e.g., the graphical route of the lead aircraft). The required features were\\nimplemented per the standard. Particular features of interest for this simulation and further\\ndescription include the progress indictor, feasibility check status indication, and the IM speed\\nconformance monitoring status visual advisory. The behavior of the IM speed conformance is defined in DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a). After an IM\\nspeed is presented to the flight crew, an 11 second delay is activated that allows time for the\\nflight crew and aircraft to react to the new speed. After the 11 seconds has transpired, the\\naircrafts current speed is compared to an expected speed change profile (0.5 knots [kts] per\\nsecond), built as a linear change of speed between the current aircraft speed and the IM speed.\\nIf the aircraft deviates from that speed change profile by more than 5 knots (faster for a\\ndeceleration or slower for an acceleration), the IM speed conformance visual and aural advisory\\nis displayed to the flight crew. When the aircraft speed is brought within 5 knots of the IM\\nspeed, the speed conformance monitoring stops and no additional advisories are provided.\\nMonitoring is stopped at this point because the flight crew is within acceptable tolerances of\\nthe IM speed. If any corrections are necessary after that point, a new IM speed will be\\npresented and monitoring will be resumed. The HITL simulation implementation of the conformance monitoring and alerting\\nunintentionally deviated from that defined in DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a). The HITL implementation\\ntriggered the advisory at any speed off the expected speed change profile (i.e., the 5 kt\\ntolerance was not implemented). It also advised after the aircrafts speed got within 5 knots of 3-4 the IM speed, but then again went greater than 5 knots of the profile speed (i.e., the\\nmonitoring and alerting was not inhibited after the aircraft was within 5 knots of the IM speed). Per DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a), the feasibility check status indication was provided when the\\nequipment determined the ASG could not be achieved even if the IM trail aircraft flew its\\nfastest or slowest speeds relative to the speed profile. It was only provided during the achieve\\nstage when greater than 30 NM from the ABP. A visual advisory was provided to the flight crew.\\nIf the aircraft was unable to slow enough to achieve the ASG [as determined by the equation\\n(Predicted Spacing Interval [PSI] + 0.15 x time-to-go [TTG]) < ASG], the flight crew was provided\\nwith the message: Not feasible, ASG too large. If the aircraft was unable to speed up enough\\nto achieve the ASG [as determined by the equation (PSI 0.11 x TTG) > ASG] the flight crew was\\nprovided with the message: Not feasible, ASG too small. The multiplier for the TTG value is\\nlarger because the aircraft has a greater capability to slow down than it does to speed up. For time-based ASGs, a progress indicator is required to be provided to the flight crew for\\nsituation awareness information during the maintain stage and when within 30 NM of the ABP\\nfor the achieve stage. At a minimum, the progress indication is defined as simply the display of\\nthe numerical values of the ASG and either the PSI (during the achieve stage) or the Measured\\nSpacing Interval (MSI) (during the maintain stage)3.
