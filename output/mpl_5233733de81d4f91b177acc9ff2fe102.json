They can often directly manipulate or respond to the physical world \\nand/or directly respond to it. The result is a manifold increase in the possible consequences from undesired \\nfunctionality. These now include, but are not limited to, impacts on physical property, availability of critical \\nservices, availability of physical resources, potential impacts on the environment, and potential threats to \\nhuman health and safety. Taming system computational complexity is a difficult and ongoing challenge. To do that, it is critical to \\nhave a means to understand each system, its dependencies and interdependencies, and to understand how Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 18-1212 / DHS reference number 17-J-00100-01 Mittal, Cane, Schmidt, Tufarolo and Harris failures of one component impacts aspects of the whole. With the rise of IoT and its corresponding expanded \\nimpact pattern, an optimal mitigation strategy needs to encompass the new range of physical impacts as \\nwell. Figure 6: PES for IoT-Inclusive System Figure 7: PES hypergraph with only two LogicalDevice and two Connection-Wired entities The following section presents an approach to modeling systems with IoT devices. This modeling approach \\nprovides a way to apply rigor to the problem of tracing operational dependencies within such a system as a \\nmeans to highlight potential vulnerability sources. By identifying the most likely cascading failure sources, \\nand tracing the failure consequences to any eventual physical impact, one can determine how best to apply \\nmitigations that avoid the most damaging cascades (Zimmerman and Restrepo 2009). While this model \\ncannot predict the unpredictable (e.g., which systems will be attacked, or which will have a software \\nvulnerability), it can help one understand the relationship between components and better clarify where risk \\nmitigation strategies will be most effective. 6 IOT MODEL In order to model the IoT in its environment, we identify the following fourteen perspectives. Each \\nperspective is necessary to understand the multi-dimensional nature of IoT. The perspectives are \\nenumerated in Table 1. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.

Case Number 18-1212 / DHS reference number 17-J-00100-01 Table 1: Fourteen IoT-Inclusive System Perspectives ID Perspective Description 1 Behavior Describes the overall macro IoT behavior as a whole. The behavior could be \\nemergent (i.e. IoT resulted from devices just being connected to the Internet) or \\nengineered (i.e. IoT resulted from following engineering practices). 2 Application \\nDomain Identifies various environmental variables and properties that monitor the \\nusefulness of a particular IoT solution and its application to a single or multiple \\nsectors. It also describes the effect a particular IoT solution has on a sectorial basis. 3 Physical \\nstructure Describes the logical structure of a Thing: a sensor, an actuator, an aggregator \\nassembling multiple inputs for a single output, or more specifically, a computing \\ndevice having variable computational power levels. 4 Services Describes various services a Thing consumes or provides to other components on \\nthe Network. Essentially, IoT solves a business problem or creates opportunities \\nto develop new business cases, eventually leading to formulation of new business \\nprocesses. 5 Resources Describes resources, their management and supply-demand within an IoT system \\ndeployment 6 Information Describes the knowledge structure as it is exchanged between resources, across \\nnetwork and various Things. 7 Network Describes the network structure between two Things. The geographical distance \\nand relative compatibility between two things may ultimately decide what kind of \\nresources are invoked along the pathways. 8 Vulnerability Describes the vulnerability inherent in the IoT deployment across multiple \\nperspectives. The vulnerabilities need to be specified at the intersection of various \\nperspectives define in this list. Various scoring systems such as Common \\nVulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) (First.org n.d.), Common Weakness \\nScoring System (CWSS) (Coley 2014), etc. can be used to assess vulnerability \\ninherent in an IoT deployment. 9 Organizations Describes various organizations having vested interest in a given IoT deployment. \\nMultiple organizations may be involved in multiple IoT deployments requiring \\nshared services, resources, information and applications 10 Security Describes security mechanisms and technologies 11 Privacy Describe privacy mechanisms and technologies 12 Analytics Describes the analytics required to ascertain the correct functioning of an IoT \\ndeployment. These will involve both macro and micro levels so that the impact \\nand influence of a Thing can be viewed in relation to a particular Application \\ndomain or Sector as a whole. Eventually, such analytic frameworks will be used \\nfor instrumentation and control at a critical infrastructure level. 13 Policy Describes the relationship between multiple perspective to specify and define \\npolicies at the intersection of various perspectives. Mittal, Cane, Schmidt, Tufarolo and Harris Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 18-1212 / DHS reference number 17-J-00100-01 14 Users Describes the users involved in an IoT deployment. It may include the end-user, \\nthe transient user (i.e., a user who indirectly uses an IoT as in third-party services, \\ne.g., marketing services), and the organizations that use the applications within a\\ntypical IoT deployment. The perspectives described in Table 1 portrays an abstract IoT-Inclusive system representation. Each \\nperspective is modeled as an SES aspect. The SES model can help identify relationships between various \\nIoT perspectives that need to be considered for an IoT deployed solution. These relationships are depicted \\nby walks as described for Figure 6. Figure 8 provides a sample depiction of an IoT-Inclusive SES model. \\nThis model exhibits the following options: Ignoring the multi-aspect numbers, we have: (2 Behaviors) x (4 LogicalDevice types) x (3 Services) \\nx (2 Connection types) x (5 CommunicationProtocol types) x (2 Timeliness analytics types) x (6 \\nComputingAnalytics types) x (4 ResourceItems types), resulting in 12000 IoT deployment \\noptions/use-cases. This number does not even consider the combinations associated with entities: \\nResource, DataElement, Domain, Capability, AttackEffects, and Orgs. One can easily imagine the \\nincrease in permutations from thousands to millions of options. As stated earlier, each structural option enumerated in the above permutation can be realized as a valid \\nsystem architecture. This exploration also involves constraints and scores attributable to each of the nodes \\nthat may help in overall risk assessment. Conducting performance and risk analysis on each option shown \\nin this high-level model would be resource intensive and cost-prohibitive. As more constraints are added \\nby applying the pruning process, the IoT model moves closer to the specific IoT solution, and therefore, the \\nrisk quantification should become more tractable, both visually and mathematically.

Case Number 18-1212 / DHS reference number 17-J-00100-01 The theoretical model brings forward fourteen perspectives in a foundational IoT-Inclusive-System. It \\nshows how various entities constitute cross-references in different nodes, resulting in hyperedges that have \\nentire graphs on either side of the hyperedge. Associating various vulnerability types and risk scores to each \\nof the entities in the abstract model yields the needed abstraction level to understand the risk impact at a \\nmacro level. Further specification of constraints helps us understand risk for a family of IoT-Inclusive-\\nSystems. 7 INTEGRATED RISK EVALUATION FRAMEWORK IoT bridges IT, which is primarily concerned with data processes and OT, which is concerned with physical \\nprocesses. Both IT and OT have mature and robust risk assessment and management methodologies. \\nHowever, now that these communities are connected by IoT, differences in each communitys perspective \\ncan skew or result in incomplete, risk assessments. Understanding the potential technical consequences \\nassociated with a device or functional unit is only one, early piece in a procedure for understanding the \\noperational risk associated with that device. To understand operational risk, technical consequences need \\nto be turned into operational consequences, which are expressed in terms of their impact on the IoT-\\ninclusive system as a whole. Doing this requires an understanding of the context in which a given technical \\nconsequence occurs. This sort of context could be provided by associating the technical consequence with \\nelements in a model of the IoT system, such as described in",

  "text": "T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t Enabling Big Changes in \\nMedicare Payment 2017 brings merit-based incentives for clinicians In October 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) released rules overhauling how the agency pays physicians and other \\nclinicians. Called the Quality Payment Program, the new approach rewards the delivery of high-quality care through two interrelated pathways: Advanced Alternative Payment Models (APMs) and the Merit- based Incentive Payment System (MIPS). MITRE provided CMS with strategic guidance for the design of MIPS, which rewards quality and efficiency improvement efforts and the use of electronic health record technology. We also contributed to the development of the Advanced APMs, which provide added incentives to deliver high-quality and cost-effective care. Recognizing that true delivery system reform requires working with a range of healthcare stakeholders, CMS asked MITRE to convene the Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network, which includes health plans, providers, patients, employers, consumers, states, federal agencies, and other partners. These stakeholders are now working together to promote the adoption of alternative payment models to achieve better care and smarter spending. n 27T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n Using Data to \\nDefeat Drug Fraud Approximately 78 Americans die every day from opioid overdoses. More than half of these deaths stem from the misuse \\nof prescription opioid pain relievers. Federal and state government agencies have launched a variety of efforts to address the opioid abuse epidemic. One of these, the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP), gives individual states the ability to collect data about controlled substance transactions. MITRE researchers saw the PDMP as a means to identify prescription fraud schemes involving patients, prescribers, and pharmacies. A MITRE team worked with the state of Indiana to apply advanced analytics to more than 12 million transactions registered with the Indiana Board of Pharmacy. They used that information to create two Web-based tools. One assists prescribers in determining a patients risk of drug-seeking behavior to help catch doctor shoppers. The other scores providers for potential fraud to help predict where fraud is most likely to occur. Preventing more fraud and abuse will save more lives. n As much as \\n$72 billion a year goes toward drug \\naddiction \\ntreatment 28 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t Approximately 78 \\nAmericans die every day from opioid \\noverdoses 29T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n 30 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t Applying Safety Science \\nto Child Welfare Every year, as many as 2,000 U.S. children die as the result of abuse or neglect. MITRE is partnering with the Department of \\nHealth and Human Services (HHS) to prevent these tragic deaths through data sharing and analysis. MITRE has already successfully partnered with government and industry to use an information sharing and analysis approach to improve aviation safety and to prevent avoidable patient safety events in medical facilities. To achieve these outcomes, we collect data from a variety of sources and analyze it to identify safety issues. We are conducting an analysis for HHS to assess the potential benefits of this approach in the field of child welfare. While our long-term vision is to develop national partnerships for the sharing of child welfare and related data, we are also working at the local level. For example, we are collaborating with the County of San Diegos Health and Human Services Agency to develop a system to collect and analyze child welfare, medical, and substance abuse data. Our effort there is generating important insights and will help to refine our efforts and approach at the national level. n Every day, 4 to 8 \\nchildren in the U.S. die from abuse or neglect MITRE is \\npartnering with \\nHHS to prevent tragedies through \\ndata sharing and analysis 31T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n Cyber Lab Helps Secure \\nthe Smart Home In 2016 MITRE worked with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to create a state-of-the-art lab at the National \\nCybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) to address the threats to security and privacy posed by the Internet of Things (IoT). The term IoT refers to devices equipped with software, sensors, and effectors networked with one another via the Internet. Although these networked devices can improve efficiency in the home, they also carry security risks. The new Consumer IoT Initiative (CITI) lab functions as a simulated smart home to enable researchers to explore these challenges. Leveraging MITREs trusted adviser role, researchers can then develop strategies for securing consumers security and privacy, as well as countermeasures to address the adverse impact a large group of compromised IoT devices can have on the Internet itself. CITI is now fully operational and welcomes research topics from industry, NIST, and other sponsors. Results from the labs experiments will inform and enhance NCCoEs efforts to help U.S. industry apply secure technologies that enable consumers to enjoy the many benefits of a smart home without sacrificing security and privacy. n IoT: MITRE helps balance benefit and risk 32 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t 33T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n More than 4.6 million \\nveterans live \\nin rural areas 34 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t Assisting Veterans \\nin Rural Areas MITRE is helping demonstrate the art of the possible for managing care The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) asked MITRE to come up with a system that would improve the provision \\nof care to the 30 percent of the nations veterans who live in rural areasa setting with unique healthcare challenges. In response, MITRE helped create and pilot a system focused on rural veterans receiving home healthcare. Today, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) contracts with home health agencies for these services. Coordinating that care is a manual process involving paper forms and phone calls. This often results in missed communications, inconsistencies in the patient record, and delays in the provision of care. To address these issues, MITRE automated the process in a secure Web-based environment to enable VA and home health providers to electronically share plans of care, record patient observations, reconcile medication discrepancies, and facilitate the communication of additional orders. This pilot is demonstrating the art of the possible for managing care in the community, reducing costs, and improving patient safety, and it positions the VHA as a national leader in moving toward patient-centered plans of care. n 35T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n Patching Vulnerabilities in \\nOur Digital Infrastructure Over 30,000 NIST practice guides have been downloaded to date The recent denial-of-service attacks on the Internet routing company Dyn shut down major swaths of the Internet, exposing \\nvulnerabilities in our digital infrastructure. What if the targets had been the power grid or the financial sector? To safeguard the nation from such scenarios, MITRE works with NIST to accelerate the adoption of advanced security technologies. MITRE is helping the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) to engage new collaborators to drive awareness and promote early adoption of new technologies and standards. In 2016, we assisted NCCoE in publishing four practice guides on such industry-identified challenges as Securing Electronic Health Records on Mobile Devices and Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities. Our efforts also helped NCCoE increase its key stakeholder relationships by 68 percent and garnered some 30,000 practice guide downloads. In addition, MITRE developed new ways to rapidly share NCCoEs pragmatic solutions. For example, our video of the Attribute-Based Access Control practice guide has been viewed more than 2,000 times on the NIST YouTube channel. n 36 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t In October 2016, a distributed denial- of-service attack shut down dozens of popular websites 37T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n Communications \\nTesting North of the Arctic Circle 38 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t Melting icecaps are creating access for trade routes, cruise ships, and natural resource exploration, all of which \\nimply missions for the Department of Defense.
