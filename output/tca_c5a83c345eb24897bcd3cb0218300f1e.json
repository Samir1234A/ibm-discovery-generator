Recommendations and CAP Goal 3 SubGoal alignment 27The MITRE Corporation CONCLUSION \\nThe collective dialog, observations, and recommendations emerging from the Federal Workforce Symposium on September 12, 2018 represent an important step \\nforward in advancing the goals in the PMA and creating broader public-private \\ncooperation to address federal workforce challenges Stakeholders from across the \\npublic and private sectors shared a common understanding of the challenges and \\nopportunities facing all organizations today, and the federal workforce specifically \\nWhile acknowledging obvious differences in their respective environments, common \\nthemes did emerge, such as the need to harness the digital transformation so that \\nit serves government and business workforce management and the importance of \\npeople-driven strategies to successful transformation A key objective of the symposium was to cultivate new partnerships to help address \\nthe governments challenges From the energy in the room and the feedback we \\nreceived, we feel that the symposium succeeded in laying this foundation The key \\nis now for OMB to take advantage of these new relationships and the openness and \\ninterest that participants brought to the table Continue to build on that momentum \\nby consistently engaging those who were there to get feedback on emerging \\nstrategies and actions Reach out to those who could not attend to share what \\noccurred and to bring them into future discussions And, finally, engage the federal \\nlabor organizations in collaborative discussions focused on shared interests Looking \\nahead, it is of vital importance to recognize that listening and learning about what \\ncan and should be done should continue to come from voices inside and outside \\nof the federal government As the symposium participants consider the outcomes \\nof an event they created together, we recommend embracing the people-centered \\nprocesses that enabled a full dayand a full futureof innovation on behalf of their \\nmissions, their organizations, and their people As described in the PMA and in the discussions at the symposium, the commitment \\nto change is long-term, and the partnerships the government needs to help solve \\nproblems should be equally enduring The federal governments partners are ready \\nand interested in advancing together As one participant said about the symposium \\nattendees after the session: We should not let each of us go our separate ways, \\ntaking action based on our individual perceptions without some reliance on that \\ndiverse aggregate. I believe we need to move forward together. 28 Report Symposium on the Federal Workforce for the 21st Century A M Fadida Consulting Accenture ACT-IAC Administrative Conference of the United States Amazon American University Association for Talent Development Association of Government Accountants A-Z Consultant Services Bipartisan Policy Center Booz Allen Hamilton Boston Consulting Group CPS HR Consulting Definitive Logic Deloitte Consulting U S Department of Agriculture U S Department of Commerce U S Department of Defense U S Department of Education U S Department of Homeland Security U S Department of Housing and Urban Development U S Department of Justice U S Department of the Treasury Domestic Policy Council Eagle Hill Consulting Ernst & Young ETW Fannie Mae Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council Federal Railroad Administration FedFusion General Services Administration George Mason University Mercatus Center George Washington University Georgetown University Government Matters Greater Washington Partnership Guidehouse Guild Education Harvard University Hemsley Fraser The Heritage Foundation HP Inc HumRRO IBEW IBM Center for the Business of Government ICF International, Inc Information Technology Industry Council Insight Venture Partners KSG Strategic Consulting Learning Tree International Markle Foundation McKinsey & Company Mercer Merit Network, Inc (Michigan) Micron Technology Microsoft Montville and Company, LLC National Academy of Public Administration National Institutes of Health National Nuclear Security Administration National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Science Foundation NIC Federal Northrop Grumman U S Office of Management and Budget U S Office of Personnel Management Oracle Partnership for Public Service Professional Services Council Pymetrics Senior Executives Association Skillsoft Syracuse University Maxwell School of Citizenship \\nand Public Affairs TVM Consulting University of Maryland Robert H Smith School of \\nBusiness University of Phoenix University of South Florida The Volcker Alliance Willis Towers Watson APPENDIX: PARTICIPATING \\nORGANIZATIONS 29The MITRE Corporation Endnotes\\n1 Willis Towers Watson, 2018 2 https://www govexec com/management/2016/06/senate-moves-change-vets-preference-federal-hiring/129118/ 3 National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), White Paper No Time to Wait, Part 2: Building a Public \\nService for the 21st Century, September 2018 4 McKinsey Quarterly, Making a market in talent, May 2006 5 Corporate Executive Board (CEB), CEB Corporate Executive Leadership Council, Open Source Change: Making \\nChange Management Work, 2016 6 Government Accountability Office (GAO), Federal Workforce: Additional Analysis and Sharing of Promising \\nPractices Could Improve Employee Engagement and Performance, July 2015 Available: https://www gao gov/\\nassets/680/671396 pdf 7 U S Merit Systems Protection Board, The Power of Federal Employee Engagement, 2008 8 FEVS, Partnership for Public Service Available: http://bestplacestowork org/BPTW/analysis/ 9 Career opportunities impact on retention: Glassdoor, February 2017, Why Do Workers Quit?
