  "text": "is typical of the price \\nchart most people see in news reports on the stock market. With data at the microsecond level, \\neven in this typical view one starts to see some anomalous behavior with the spikes at around \\n44,000 seconds. Those spikes are after-hours trades which, along with pre-market, are not usually \\nshown when one looks at a stock on Yahoo Finance or similar sites. This begins to illustrate the \\ncomplexity of considering data flows when looking at finance markets. Figure 5. Apple stock price on August 11, 2015 Dynamics become more complex when one considers the number of trades per second for a \\nsingle stock, as seen in Figure 6. Here, one will notice the clear difference in activity during pre-\\nmarket, regular market (09:30 16:00), and after-hours trading (16:00 20:00). ix Figure 6. Apple stock trades per second on August 11, 2015 To get a sense of how much capital is flowing across the NMS, a look into the number of dollars \\ntraded per second in Figure 7 reveals some astounding numbers. Here one sees that at the highest \\nspike $40 million in Apple stock is traded in one second. Figure 7. Apple stock dollars traded per second on August 11, 2015 To put things in perspective, the cumulative dollars traded, Figure 8, shows that theres a steady \\nclimb to around $10 billion traded in a single day for this asset. At such a high rate, the spikes \\nseen above $40 million traded in one second hardly register. x Figure 8. Apple stock cumulative dollars traded on August 11, 2015 Figure 9 shows how assets are traded at a high volume at the multiple exchanges that comprise \\nthe NMS. The opening and closing hours differ per exchange and are the reason that some lines \\nstart late or stop short. The start of regular trading at 09:30 (19,800 seconds since 04:00) is seen \\nin Figure 9 as the sharp increase in volume at all markets at opening time. Figure 9. Cumulative volume by exchange for AAPL shares Multi-asset Analysis3.2\\nThe analysis will now examine what is experienced in this sector by looking at the combined \\ncharacteristics of all assets so get a broader picture of activity. Tying the dynamic fluctuations of \\nmarket activity with communication networks and notions of bandwidth or capacity, it may be \\nmore intuitive to think of trade volume and quote lots (a quote lot is typically 100 shares) in \\nterms of messages, where a message represents an atomic unit of communication that describes a \\nnumber of shares or lots for a particular asset (e.g., 8 shares of Apple). Since there are far more \\nquote messages than there are trade messages (roughly 10 to 1), the following figures of quote \\nmessages per day represent the high end of traffic on communication networks. In Figure 10, one \\ncan again clearly see the opening and closing of regular trading hours. Figure 10 shows messages \\nthat are recorded at each Tape or SIP of which there are three. The SIPs link the U.S. markets \\nby processing and consolidating all protected bid/ask quotes and trades from every trading venue xi 12 https://www.ctaplan.com/index\\n13 http://www.utpplan.com/overview\\n14 http://www.ftserussell.com/index-series/index-resources/russell-reconstitution\\n15 http://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/market_statistics/historical_market_volume/ into a single, easily consumed data feed.12 SIP A and B are operated by the Consolidated Tape \\nAssociation and contain stocks listed on NYSE on SIP A and stocks listed on NYSE Arca, NYSE \\nMKT, BATS and regional exchanges on SIP B. SIP C is operated by NASDAQ for NASDAQ \\nlisted stocks.13 \\nDuring regular trading hours there are very few times that less than 1,000 messages are seen per \\nsecond while there are times when message traffic exceeds 100,000 messages per second. Similar \\nto Figure 6, Figure 10 shows that the highest traffic occurs right after markets open or before they \\nclose. Figure 10. Quote messages per second in seconds since midnight Several analyses were performed to determine the data profiles in the NMS. Dates for the \\nanalysis were picked based on the number of trades on a date, notional dollar value of trades, and \\nvolatility. A date, June 24, 2016, with features on the high-end of these criteria was chosen for \\nadditional analysis. This date had the highest dollar value day of 2016 and the sixth highest in the \\nlast eight years. The high activity seen on this date was due to a combination of the Russell \\nindices rebalancing14 (a known periodic occurrence) with the results of Great Britains vote to \\nleave the EU.\\nThe following tables, based on an analysis of daily summary data15, provide visibility into the \\nhigh activity days and exchanges. The top 10 high trade and notional value activity days are \\nshown in Table 1 and Table 2. Table 3 shows the amount of trade activity by exchange since https://www.ctaplan.com/index\\nhttp://www.utpplan.com/overview\\nhttp://www.ftserussell.com/index-series/index-resources/russell-reconstitution\\nhttp://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/market_statistics/historical_market_volume/ xii 2010. Since this tally only includes trades and trades are about 1/20th of all messages then it is \\nestimated that NASDAQ processed approximately 260B messages from 2010 to February of \\n2018.\\nThe average day sees somewhat less than half the number of trades that are seen on the highest \\nactivity days with a mean of 30,403,170 and a standard deviation of 7,765,933 trades. The \\nminimum number of trades seen since 2010 is 7,556,055. Table 1.

The notional \\nvalue of trades is just part of the story though. From an engineering perspective, the rates of \\nmessages passing between the exchanges is most important for the design of testing capabilities. \\nThe messages that pass between exchanges are not just trade messages as tallied in Table 1. Far \\nmore numerous are the quote messages that detail the price and number of shares a party is \\nwilling to buy or sell. On the direct links between exchanges, quotes are referred to as add \\nmessages. Prices change very often throughout a day and a party who submitted an add message \\noften wants to cancel their quote when the parameters of it no longer suit their means. Canceling \\nquotes is done through modify messages. As seen in Figure 11, messages break down to roughly \\n49% add, 46% modify, and 4 % trade messages. The remainder of message types, at less than 1% \\nof the total, will not be covered here. Frequency of observed message types add modify trade other Figure 11. Frequency of observed message types xiv 16 https://usa.visa.com/run-your-business/small-business-tools/retail.html \\n17 https://blog.whatsapp.com/10000631/Connecting-One-Billion-Users-Every-Day\\n18 Protocol developed by the Island Alternative Trading System\\n19 https://www.batstrading.com/resources/membership/BATS_PITCH_Specification.pdf Rates of messages across all exchanges on a single day are shown in Figure 12. This figure \\nshows the aggregated counts of all message types across all 8,000+ tickers on a single day. The \\nmessages are counted in single second intervals from 04:00 in the morning to 20:00 at night. The \\nregular trading day (9:30am 4:00pm ET) is clearly shown with the abrupt increase and decrease \\nof activity. Message rates peak at 2,154,769/sec and average 117,919/sec during the trading day. \\nIn all, this day saw 2,858,836,964 messages on the direct data feeds. Figure 12. Rates of messages for all tickers in a single day For comparison, the Visa payment network processes 150 million transactions per day and is \\narchitected to handle a maximum of 24,000 transactions per second16. The messaging app \\nWhatsApp handles 55 billion messages per day17. While WhatsApp handles more messages, they \\nare at the other end of the spectrum from the time critical nature of payment networks and asset \\ntrading. Bandwidth3.3\\nTo convert message rates to bandwidth needs we can look at how the messages are formatted and \\ntransmitted. Exchanges use different market data feed protocols with the primary ones being \\nFinancial Information Exchange (FIX), ITCH18, and PITCH19. These protocols share similar \\ncharacteristics in that for each message type they encode similar information. For add messages https://usa.visa.com/run-your-business/small-business-tools/retail.html\\nhttps://blog.whatsapp.com/10000631/Connecting-One-Billion-Users-Every-Day xv 20 http://cdn.batstrading.com/resources/membership/BATS_Connectivity_Manual.pdf\\n21 http://cdn.batstrading.com/resources/features/bats_exchange_Latency.pdf\\n22 http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/Productsservices/trading/CoLo/ExpressConnectFS.pdf they encode the message type, unique message identification number, timestamp, order type, \\nnumber of shares, stock identifier, and price. The importance of speed and quantity of messages \\npushes these to be small with an ITCH add order comprising 40 bytes, cancel modify orders at 23 \\nbytes, and trades at 44 bytes. Combining the different order types the bandwidth calculation that \\nfollows will use 37.5 bytes per message for bandwidth calculations in congruence with the BATS \\nexchange connection examples20.
