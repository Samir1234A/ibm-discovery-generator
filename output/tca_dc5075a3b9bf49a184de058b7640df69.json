Huntsville, AL Approved By signed 14 Nov 19 Mike Russell, T843 Date Group Lead, Model-Based Architecture & Eng. iii Abstract MITRE funded analysis was conducted on the feasibility of using a 72-satellite constellation at an altitude of 1000 km to communicate with both low flying objects and low Earth orbiting (LEO) satellites. In addition, the satellites would be designed to communicate with ground terminal locations using radio frequency (RF) transmitters. The proposed satellite constellation would provide comprehensive communications coverage across the continental United States. The results of this analysis have shown the impracticability of such a solution at this time due to the satellites power budget. For this design, the satellite is required to use a heritage radio frequency data transmitter to communicate resulting in a cost of almost $5 billion for the satellite constellation with a design life of 13 years. Comparison to the historical example of the FireSat II satellite provided the validation for the sizing and design of the proposed satellite. The satellite sizing models used equations found in Space Mission Engineering: The New SMAD [1]. Lastly, the cost estimate was provided by the 2010 version of the Small Satellite Cost Model developed by The Aerospace Corporation. iv v Table of Contents Introduction \\n2.1 Introduction \\n2.2 Constellation Parameters \\n2.3 Coverage Model \\n2.3.2 Methodology \\n2.3.3 Coverage Model Output \\n2.5 Power System Model \\n2.5.2 Power System GUI Design \\n2.5.3 Solar Panel Sizing \\n2.5.4 Battery Sizing \\n2.5.5 Power System Model Outputs \\n2.7 Spacecraft Bus Dry Mass Estimate \\n2.8 Propulsion System Mass Model \\n2.9 First Order Estimate of Satellite Dimensions \\n2.10 ADCS Model \\n2.10.2 Determination Transmitters \\n2.10.3 Attitude and Control System (ACS) Initiation File \\n2.10.4 ACS Sizing Function \\n2.10.4.2 Solar Radiation Pressure (SRP) Torque Calculation \\n2.10.4.3 Atmospheric Drag Torque Calculation \\n2.10.4.4 Magnetic Torque Calculation \\n2.10.4.5 Gravity-Gradient Torque Calculation \\n2.10.4.6 Reaction Wheel Sizing \\n2.10.4.7 ACS Propulsion Sizing \\n2.10.4.8 ACS Model Outputs \\n3.1 Introduction \\n3.2 Satellite Power System Model \\n3.3 Propulsion System Mass Model \\n3.4 ADCS Model \\n4.1 Coverage Model \\n4.2 Satellite Power Budget \\n4.3 Satellite Power System Results \\n4.4 Satellite Mass Results \\n4.5 Satellite Dimensions \\n4.6 Satellite Cost Model \\n6.1 Laser Communication \\n6.2 SolidWorks Drawing \\n6.3 SSCM \\nFigure 2-1.

Satellite Dimensions. \\nFigure 2-1 Coverage Model Output 2.4 First-Order Satellite Power Estimate Once the coverage model was completed and the optimal number of transmitters per satellite was selected, a first-order power estimate was generated. There are two approaches for determining a spacecrafts mass and power covered in SME: The New SMAD. For the first approach, as described in section 14.7.1 SCS Example on page 432, one can begin with a target mass for the entire system and then determine the mass and power available for the spacecraft. Conversely, as described in section 14.7.2 FireSat II Example on page 435, one can start with the payload and then determine the mass and power for the spacecraft. While the first method is great for flexible mission objectives, the FireSat II example is used in this analysis 2-6 since the payloads of RF transmitters and laser communication units have already been defined by MITRE and the results of the coverage model. Using Table 2-1, the Low-Earth-Orbit with propulsion spacecraft section is used to generate a total power estimate (page 424 of SME: The New SMAD [1]). Subsystem (% of Total Power) No Prop LEO Prop High Earth Planetary Payload 43% 46% 35% 22% Structure and Mechanisms 0% 1% 0% 1% Thermal Control 5% 10% 14% 15% Power (Incl. harness) 10% 9% 7% 10% Telemetry, Tracking, & Command (TT&C) 11% 12% 16% 18% On-board Processing 13% 12% 10% 11% Attitude Determination and Control 18% 10% 16% 12% Propulsion 0% 0% 2% 11% Average Power (W) 299 794 691 749 According to the chart, 46% of the total power is used by the payload. With a total payload power consumption already known, the total power for the spacecraft is estimated by dividing the payload power by 0.46. This first-order estimate proves to be highly effective in that the final estimate for the power consumption of the satellite is significantly close to the final estimate that will be derived in the results section. Lastly, in order to accurately model the situation that the satellite will not always be operating at full power, it is assumed that the satellite operates a third of the day at full-power, a third of the day at half-power, and a third of the day at no-power. Table 2-1 Average Power by Subsystem for 4 Types of Spacecraft 2-7 Furthermore, it is assumed that you can only communicate at full-power during sunlight periods where the satellite is able to use power from both batteries and the solar panels. 2.5 Power System Model 2.5.1 Purpose With a power requirement computed, a system to meet the power demand can be developed. The power system is comprised of two components: solar cells and batteries. There is a plethora of factors that influence the size and type of solar panels to be used. The first factor that affects the size needed is that the surface of the solar array may be eclipsed for extended durations of time depending on the satellites altitude and inclination. Subsequently, a MATLAB program developed by the author was used to calculate the sunlight and eclipse periods for the satellites defined orbit to determine how much time the satellites solar panels will have to collect sunlight. Furthermore, there are three types of solar cells that are generally used for satellite applications (Gallium Arsenide, Multijunction, and Silicon). These three types of solar cells provide varying efficiency levels (higher efficiency, less area) and cost. As a result, the surface area of a solar panel needed to produce enough power to fulfill the satellites power requirements require calculation for all three types to compare the surface area needed and the cost for each case to ensure that the optimal solution is being selected. Lastly, the batteries must be designed to store the energy derived from the solar panels. To accomplish this task, a MATLAB graphical user interface (GUI) linked to STK was created. The following design method was derived from Section 21.2 Power on page 641 of SME: The New SMAD [1]. 2-8 2.5.2 Power System GUI Design The first step in creating this model was to design a GUI that is easy to use. Designing the GUI first also defines the outputs for the program in an orderly manner which streamlines the coding process. Keeping in mind that conducting trade-studies is a key goal for this model, the GUI allows any user to quickly view results for various power budgets, orbits, design life, and battery quantities. The GUI developed for this analysis is shown below. 2.5.3 Solar Panel Sizing For the program to calculate the solar panel area needed, the user first must input the following information: power needed during eclipse, power needed during daylight, orbit altitude, orbit inclination, and mission duration. Mission duration and the average power requirements are the two key design considerations in sizing the solar array because photovoltaic Figure 2-2 Satellite Power System GUI 2-9 systems are sized at end-of-life (EOL) to ensure that adequate power can be supplied for the entire duration of the mission. Once the following design parameters have been input, the power the solar array must provide during daylight to power the spacecraft along with recharging the batteries must be calculated. = + \\n\\n\\n For",
