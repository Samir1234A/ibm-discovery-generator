Case Number 18-3121 1 A Passion for Law Leads to an Unexpected Career in Cybersecurity Nickyra Jackson When Nickyra Jackson was a teenager, she deeply respected her father's work as an engineerat \\nNASA, no lessbut she had absolutely no interest becoming one herself. \\\"He took me to work with \\nhim, and I liked how engineers problem-solved together. But my passion was for the law.\\\" Ultimately, Jackson studied criminology, pre-law, at the University of Maryland. Then, during an \\ninternship in the Office of the Chief Information Officer at the U.S. Department of the Treasury \\nheadquarters, she found her niche. \\\"It was a turning point for me, working both in technology and \\npolicy. I was surrounded by engineers, policy, and security experts. I loved it.\\\" In the end, she veered from a dedicated legal career. Instead, she continued at the University of \\nMaryland, receiving both a Master of Science in Information Systems Management and a Master of \\nBusiness Administration. She became a systems engineer focusing on cybersecurity and privacy. After 10 years at MITRE, she still enjoys working with a pool of systems engineering, policy, and \\ncybersecurity experts. \\\"You need people at the table from different disciplines to build a system that \\nnot only satisfies a variety of requirements, but also works. Is it truly functional? Is it secure? How do \\nyou test both and be sure?\\\" Protecting IT Systems on Land and at Sea Securing our military's cyber systems is a critical part of our defense system, and Jackson appreciates \\nthe opportunity to work directly with our nation's warfighters. Collectively, she spent two years in \\nHawaii working onsite at the United States Pacific Command and Pacific Air Forces, alongside \\npersonnel from all military branches. \\\"One of the pleasures of working at MITRE is helping the \\nwarfighters. I always give my very best but supporting them brings about an even greater sense of \\npride and commitment. I ramp it up another notch. In Hawaii, Jackson assisted with testing and operationalizing a MITRE-developed tool called Cyber \\nCommand System (CyCS) to provide situational awareness to command leaders about their critical \\nassets, including their information technology. \\\"If a router or switch becomes degraded, CyCS will \\nshow what kind of impact that might have on the mission. This particular project really hit home for \\nme the importance of the work we do at MITREhow we make a difference and keep our nation \\nsafe.\\\" More recently, Jackson has worked on a project for U.S. Army Central, where she led a continuous \\nmonitoring task to develop a strategy and plan. The U.S. Army Central functions as Americas land \\ndomain experts in the Middle East, Central Asia, and South Asiaproviding continuous oversight and \\ncontrol of Army operations throughout the region. Jackson says, \\\"We ensure the right safeguards are \\nimplemented so their network will remain secure and resilient, and the warfighters can accomplish \\ntheir mission.\\\" In addition, Jackson has helped many government sponsors with systems security and privacy issues, \\nincluding the Department of Health and Human Services (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, https://www.mitre.org/capabilities/systems-engineering/overview\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/capabilities/systems-engineering/overview\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/capabilities/systems-engineering/overview\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/capabilities/systems-engineering/overview\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/capabilities/cybersecurity/overview?category=all\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/capabilities/cybersecurity/overview?category=all\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/research/technology-transfer/technology-licensing/cyber-command-system-cycs\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/research/technology-transfer/technology-licensing/cyber-command-system-cycs\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/research/technology-transfer/technology-licensing/cyber-command-system-cycs\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/research/technology-transfer/technology-licensing/cyber-command-system-cycs\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/research/technology-transfer/technology-licensing/cyber-command-system-cycs\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/publications/technical-papers/january-2018-federal-ciso-summit-report\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/publications/technical-papers/privacy-engineering-framework Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.

Room to Grow, Room to Run \\\"MITRE has been very good to me,\\\" Jackson says. \\\"It offers what I look for in a career: meaningful \\nwork, the opportunity to grow, and the sense that each new project is stretching me. That's what \\nmotivates me. For people who want the same things, they'll find them at MITRE. \\\"Any time I get the opportunity, I talk to college students about working in STEM [science, \\ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics.] Im proud to tell them about MITRE and the \\nopportunities they'll find here.\\\" Jackson is also active in her church and in numerous community events, including a mentoring \\nprogram for adolescent and teenage girls. She has been married for just over a year. In addition to \\nloving music and her work, she graduated from running half marathons to the full Marine Corps \\nMarathon. \\\"That was very rewardingand it felt good.\\\" Not surprisingly, Jackson is a strong believer in the value of perseverance and fortitude. \\\"I tell the \\nyoung women that I mentor that you should always press forward for the things you're really \\npassionate about. Be relentless in the pursuit of it, no matter how difficult it may be.\\\" by Bill Eidson https://www.mitre.org/careers/working-at-mitre\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/careers/working-at-mitre\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/careers/working-at-mitre/professional-development\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/careers/student-programs\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/careers/student-programs/student-voices/location-is-no-limitation-for-mitres-stem-summer-internships\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/careers/student-programs/student-voices/location-is-no-limitation-for-mitres-stem-summer-internships\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/careers/student-programs/student-voices/location-is-no-limitation-for-mitres-stem-summer-internships _top\\n _GoBack \",",
