Minimizing up-front engineering costs is important because the factors motivating agen- cies to consider decision-support systemsdecision backlogs re- sulting from insufficient resourcestend to preclude solutions that require extensive development efforts. The domains of particular interest to us include disability benefit claims, immigration petitions, landlord-tenant disputes, and attor- ney misconduct complaints. The high volumes of cases of these types mean both that large training sets are available and that agen- cies have an incentive to consider technologies to improve decision processes. However, because of the sensitivity of most of these data sets, we have found it convenient to perform initial research on an open-source data set consisting of 16,092 World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) domain name dispute decisions.3 WIPO cases have only two possible decisions: granting or deny- ing the request to transfer a domain name to the Complainant. WIPO cases are consistently segmented into seven sections: Parties, Domain Name, History, Background, Contentions, Findings, and Decision. The Findings section typically consists of four subsections, 1See [33] for a recent exception to this generalization.\\n2The factors of [4] are examples of features in this sense.\\n3http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisionsx/index-gtld.html. http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisionsx/index-gtld.html Semi-Supervised Methods for Explainable Legal Prediction ICAIL19, June 2019, Montreal, QB, CA one for each of the three requirements that Complainants must establish to prevail (issues): confusability, no legitimate rights or interests, and bad faith, plus an additional issuereverse name highjackingthat we do not address. We formed a case-decision corpus in which the facts of each instance consist of the concatena- tion of the first 5 sections, and the decision is transferred or not transferred. This dataset has a roughly 10-to-1 class skew in favor of transferred. In addition, we formed a separate corpus for each of the three issues, for a total of 4 datasets used in the experiments below. The next section describes development and evaluation of the NFE, most minimalist approach approach to explainable decision prediction. 3 A NO-FEATURE-ENGINEERING PARADIGM The No Feature Engineering (NFE) approach (Paradigm 1) treats legal prediction as a problem of classifying texts that represent case descriptions into decision categories. This approach may be appropriate when there is a corpus of previous case-text/decision pairsas is typically the case in administrative or judicial forums and decisions can be viewed as unstructured categories, such as granting or denying a particular benefit or form of relief.4 Prototyp- ical domains fitting this description involve routine administrative decisions, such as applications for permits, licenses, or benefits, each of which characterized by relatively circumscribed and pre- dictable fact patterns and a limited range of permissible outcomes. Cases in trial or appellate courts of general jurisdiction are gener- ally ill-suited to this approach because of the wide variety of both facts giving rise to cases and types of decisions. This shallow approach to decision prediction is not appropriate for completely autonomous processes. Denial of benefits by an automated process, no matter how accurate, raises significant due- process issues, and in any event prediction accuracy is limited in this paradigm by the absence of explicit modeling of legal rules or issues. However, even an imperfect prediction can be useful in high-volume forums for (1) triage, e.g., granting benefits without further processing in extremely clear cases and routing cases to particular decision makers based on apparent complexity, and (2) decision support. 3.1 Explanation in No-Feature-Engineering Systems Since the NFE approach lacks explicit legal concepts, our approach to decision support focuses on identifying the portions of case text that are most predictive of the decision. Our hypothesis is that a decision maker may benefit from having the predictive text identified even in cases in which the decision disagrees with the models prediction. This hypothesis is based on the observation that one of the challenges of decision making is sifting through irrelevant portions of the case record to locate the most important facts. One approach to predictive-text identification would be to pro- duce a case summary that includes only the most relevant portion 4Cases in which decisions consist of numerical awards can be modeled as regres-\\nsion problems. For simplicity, we confine the discussion in this paper to categorical classification. Figure 2: Screenshot of human evaluation of the case facts. This might approximate the actions of a law clerk or other administrative assistant. However, many decision makers may prefer to see the text selected asmost relevant in its original tex- tual context. Consistent with this approach, we experimented with various approaches to highlighting important portions of the case text, including pairwise mutual information and logistic-regression model weights. However, attention-network weights [7] have the advantage over these methods in that the weights are specific to each individual case rather than global for the entire corpus. In the evaluation below, we therefore focused on attention-weight-based highlighting. 3.2 Evaluation of Attention-Based Highlighting for Decision Support Prior work had not established whether simply highlighting the most important portion of a case description based on attention weights can provide significant decision support. We therefore performed an evaluation using using an attention network trained on the WIPO cases described above. A total of 61 participants were recruited for the study: 34 with legal experience and 27 without legal experience, but none familiar with the WIPO domain. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions: Control: Case text only Highlighting: Case text plus highlighting Precedents: Case text plus positive and negative precedents Highlighting and Precedents: Case text plus highlighting and positive and negative precedents Each participant was asked to decide the issue of No Rights or Legitimate Interests (NRLI) in two separate cases and to provide a justification for each prediction. In addition, they were asked to complete a survey to collect demographics and opinions about the ICAIL19, June 2019, Montreal, QB, CA Branting, Pfaff, Weiss, Brown, Pfeifer, Chakraborty, Ferro, and Yeh experience of the tasks and usability of the interface. Participants were encouraged to complete the study within an hour. The screenshot in Figure 2 shows the interface as it was pre- sented to participants in the condition with both highlighting and precedents. All participants saw the Current Case (1) for which they were to predict the NRLI decision. Participants in conditions that included the positive and negative precedents were shown in the Prior Case pane (2) to the right of the Current Case. Partici- pants were able to toggle between two prior cases, one in which the Complainant won, and one in which the Complainant lost on the NRLI issue. For participants in conditions including highlighting, certain passages of text were highlighting in yellow, as prompted by the yellow bar above the cases (3). At any time, participants could refer back to the NRLI criteria (4). Finally, participants made their prediction (NRLI is true or false) and wrote a justification for that prediction (5). Four dependent variables were assessed for each trial: Correctness: Participant prediction (NRLI is true or false) compared to actual case outcome. Task Duration: Amount of time to evaluate case, timed from when the case is first presented until the participant submits the prediction with justification. Task Difficulty: Measured with Single Ease Question [27] and eight items selected from the Multiple Resources Ques- tionnaire [10]. User Satisfaction: Measured with System Usability Scale [13]. More participants decided Case 1 correctly (48) than incorrectly (13). However, participants with legal experience were significantly more likely to decide Case 1 correctly (30 out of 34, or 88.2 %) than those without legal experience (18 out of 27, 66.67%), 2 (1, N=61)\\n= 4.18, p = .04. Highlighting had no effect on correctness. Participants were significantly more likely to get Case 1 correct with precedents (25 out of 27, or 92.6%) than without precedents (23 out of 34, or 67.6%), 2 (1, N=61) = 5.58, p = .02. More participants decided\\nCase 2 incorrectly (53) than correctly (8). In Case 2, there were no statistically significant differences between those with and without legal experience and there were no significant effects of either highlighting or precedents on correctness. Participants with legal experience spent more time on the task for both cases. The observation that participants were more likely to correctly decide Case 1 with precedents, even though it took them signif- icantly more time to decide than without precedents, suggests that precedents contribute important information to the decision- making process even in a domain, like WIPO, without stare decisis. Overall, however, this study did not find statistically significant evidence that providing outcome-relevant case comparison features leads to improved decision making. An important proviso to these conclusions is that some partici- pants comments indicate that they mistakenly believed that their goal was to predict the outcome of the entire casewhether the domain name should be transferredrather than simply the NRLI issue, a confounding factor not evident in the pilot conducted in advance of the main study. This illustrates that non-experts can find deciding even simple administrative issues very challenging and that the design of decision-support",
