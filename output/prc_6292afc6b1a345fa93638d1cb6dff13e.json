  "text": "    \"text\": \" 1 The GATMOC presents the civil aviation communitys mid-term vision for an integrated, harmonized, and globally \\ninteroperable air navigation system. 2 Of the operations that rely on lift, unmanned free balloons can go the highest. The current record is well below 200,000 feet. Framework for Evaluating Traffic Management Services in \\nHigher Airspace Jennifer Gentry, Anuja Mahashabde, Debra Moch-Mooney \\nThe MITRE Corporation, February 2019 Introduction\\nThere is a vast realm of airspace that remains unexplored, save for a handful of scientific and \\nnational security missions. It is rife with extremes, where flights can reach multi-Mach speeds or \\nstay aloft for months as they slowly circumnavigate the globe. This region lies roughly between \\n52,000 and 160,000 feet and is referred to as higher airspace in this paper.\\nRecent breakthroughs in technology have set the stage for routine commercial operations in this \\nrealm. Companies are investing in ways to harness its potential for a wide range of commercial \\napplications. Until recently, few have contemplated how this assortment of operations will \\ncoexist where the air is thin and manned operations are likely to be the exception, not the rule. \\nTodays air traffic management (ATM) system was designed for legacy aircraft, not unmanned \\nand lighter-than-air operations. As a result, existing flight rules which govern aircraft behavior, \\nare likely to be ill-suited to these non-traditional operations. Just as the current system has \\nadapted to meet user needs, so too will adaptations be needed to safely and equitably serve the \\nneeds of these new users.\\nThus, an assessment of the pros and cons associated with ATM components is needed to \\ndetermine the most suitable path for addressing operational needs in higher airspace. This paper \\npresents a framework for evaluating ATM services in higher airspace based on the International \\nCivil Aviation Organizations (ICAO) Global Air Traffic Management Operational Concept \\n(GATMOC), which enumerates user expectations and ATM components for 2025 and beyond.1 It \\nprovides an understanding of ATM services relevant to higher airspace, viewed through the \\nprism of user expectations along with a discussion of when services beyond what are currently \\navailable may be warranted. Higher Airspace Environment\\nFor the purposes of this paper, higher airspace begins where passenger transport traffic ends, and \\nends where atmospheric density can no longer sustain lift through aerodynamics or buoyancy. As \\nmentioned previously, this region is roughly between 52,000 and 160,000 feet. Operations that \\nrely on aerodynamic lift rarely exceed 100,000 feet, while operations that rely on buoyancy \\ngenerally top out at 140,000 feet, except for some research balloons.2 This region is well below \\nthe Karman line (~330,000 feet), and thus still considered airspace. \\nThe lower boundary is consistent with the Federal Aviation Administrations (FAA) JO7110.65s 2 3 FAA JO 7400.2, Procedures for Handling Airspace Matters, also defines Jet Routes as being between FL180 and FL450.\\n4 Amateur, hobbyist, research and defense related operations, while peripherally considered, are not the focus of this analysis.\\n5 These operations include orbital and suborbital spacecraft, amateur rockets, and air launched rockets. Vehicles returning to earth from orbit also transit this airspace; some are controlled reentries (deorbit) and some are not (decay). definition of Jet Routes as not exceeding Flight \\nLevel (FL) 450.3 Also, FAA Advisory Circular \\nguidance on high altitude operations does not \\naddress altitudes above FL510 [1] [2]. Higher airspace, generally associated with the \\nstratosphere (see Figure 1), differs from the \\ntroposphere below in two key areas: Higher airspace is considered above \\nthe weather. High winds associated with the \\njet stream top out around 50,000 feet; the \\nthunderstorms stop around 60,000 feet. According to the U.S. Naval Flight \\nSurgeons manual [3], from a physiological \\nviewpoint space begins when 50,000 feet is \\nreached since supplemental 100 percent oxygen \\nno longer protects man from hypoxia. Anticipated Operations in Higher \\nAirspace There are two broad categories of commercial operations that can access this region: 1) \\noperations that conduct their mission in higher airspace, and 2) operations that rapidly transit \\nhigher airspace en route to their mission.4 The focus of this paper is on the former, since they are \\nexpected to dwell in higher airspace, and therefore require a range of traffic management \\nservices. Transiting operations will spend little time in this region on the way to their final \\ndestination, typically using segregated airspace.5 The needs of these transiting operations remain \\nthe same throughout their entire trajectory and are not unique to higher airspace. \\nVehicles with wings, rotors, and those that use lighter-than-air gases, rely on air for lift. As \\naltitude increases, the air thins and so does the number of viable operations. Only a handful of \\nspecialized vehicle types can operate with ease in higher airspace. \\nThe five categories of vehicles most likely to operate in this region include: unmanned balloons \\n(e.g., sounding, super pressure and zero pressure), manned balloons (e.g., space tourism), \\nunmanned aircraft, manned aircraft (e.g., supersonic and hypersonic) and unmanned airships. \\nGeneral operational characteristics of these vehicle types are captured in Table 1, and Figure 2 \\nclassifies these diversely performing operations by speed and trajectory. Table 1. Performance of Commercial Vehicles Anticipated to Dwell in Higher Airspace Operation Type Speed Duration Cruise Altitude (feet) Unmanned Balloons (Super and Zero Pressure) Low Hours Months 50,000 to 75,000 Figure 1. Atmospheric Layers 3 Manned Balloons (Space Tourism) Low Hours 100,000 Long Endurance Unmanned Aircraft Low Days Months 60,000 to 85,000 Supersonic Transport Aircraft (Manned) Very High Hours 55,000 to 75,000 Unmanned Airships Low Days 55,000 to 70,000 Figure 2. Commercial Vehicle Types Included in each Performance Category Few operations in higher airspace are expected to maintain a steady altitude on mission. Most \\nlow-speed horizontal trajectory vehicles ascend in altitude with the heat of the day and descend at \\nnight. Some platforms use different altitudes for transiting as opposed to station keeping. Even \\nhigh-speed horizontal trajectory flights will slowly ascend as fuel is burned. High level analysis \\nindicates that the altitude range between FL550 and FL750 is expected to experience the highest \\ndemand. \\nOperations in higher airspace will likely be concentrated in specific geographic locations due to \\ntheir business needs, operational limitations and/or environmental reasons. While the overall \\nanticipated number of operations is low, most of these operations will remain in higher airspace \\nfor extended periods of time. This has significant ATM services implications, as current services \\nare geared toward legacy traffic operations which are greater in number, but considerably shorter \\nin duration.\\nThe following is a list of characteristics unique to commercial operations in higher airspace: Long duration operations (typically months) are highly sensitive to weight and tend to 4 rely on solar power. The thinner the atmosphere, the more difficult it becomes for operations that rely on lift \\nto maneuver. Super and hypersonic aircraft have narrow viable speed ranges (also known as the \\ncoffin corner) and large turning radii. Operations that rely on buoyancy have limited control and maneuverability at all \\naltitudes, including higher airspace, unless an engine is present (e.g., airships). Anticipated Service Implications\\nThe low atmospheric density characteristic of higher airspace and the unique vehicular \\nperformance adaptations for coping with it, pose challenges for an air traffic management system \\nbuilt to accommodate a relatively homogenous fleet of maneuverable and responsive aircraft. \\nHowever, while some operational characteristics may make air traffic management more \\nchallenging, others may actually make it easier. The following categorizes features associated \\nwith higher airspace and its anticipated operations by their expected impact on ATM: Positives\\nThe lack of convective weather and jet stream increase operational predictability.o The preponderance of unmanned operations would result in less severe collision o\\noutcomes.\\nTechnologically advanced operators are likely to be able to coordinate well with o\\nother operators. Negatives:\\nWeight-sensitive vehicles, with limited onboard equipment and power, will limit o\\noptions for ATM integration.\\nHandling off-nominal situations with unmanned operations may be more complex.o New airspace needs associated with constellations of loitering vehicles will o\\nchallenge established norms.\\nThe inability to rely on tactical or last-resort collision avoidance will require o\\ndeconfliction in advance (strategic planning).\\nSingle-use and novel vehicles challenge standard safety practices associated with o\\nairworthiness and equipment certification that enable integration. User Expectations\\nThe most successful service models are informed by user expectations. Fortunately, ICAO has \\noutlined a set of civil aviation user expectations. They can be found in Appendix B of Document \\n9854, Global Air Traffic Management [4]. Not all elements are of equal relevance to the higher \\nairspace community, as they were developed with legacy operations in mind. Table 2 contains 5 6 A recent National Academies of Science press release (June 11, 2018) about its prepublication report on Assessing the Risks of \\nIntegrating Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the National Airspace System [5] stated that, FAA Should Change Its \\nSafety Risk Assessment Approach for Drones to Effectively Integrate Them Into the Nations Airspace. ICAOs description (in italics) with a brief discussion of each expectations applicability to the \\nhigher airspace environment. An additional element, not a part of ICAOs original list, but \\nspecific to the higher airspace community is included in the last row of the table. Table 2.
