  "text": "our initial understanding of the adversarys objectives.\\nTo demonstrate cyber resiliency mitigations against an active cyber adversary, we leveraged \\nexisting supply chain risk management (SCRM) guidance but added the perspective of adversary \\ngoals and defender goals to describe success (i.e., the adversarys goals are not achieved and the \\ndefenders goals are met.) This continuum of actions, reactions, constraint, and adaption to and \\nrecovery from adverse attacks (in this case supply chain attacks) is characteristic of cyber \\nresiliency. Through our analysis, we recognized that while the adversarys ultimate goal is to \\nimpact the operational mission system, the adversary will exercise the complete CAL in earlier \\nacquisition lifecycle phases in order to achieve intermediate goals. These intermediate goals \\ninclude gathering information about mission system development and developing and inserting \\nexploit tools to place hooks in contractor environments for later use.\\nIn Section 2, we introduce key definitions and the frameworks used in our analysis. Section 3 \\ndescribes the adversarys goals in attacking a supply chain to exploit a targeted operational \\nenvironment and describes and provides examples for attacking the systems and components in \\neach stage of the acquisition life cycle. \\nSection 4 walks through an example using the Commercial Solutions for Classified capability \\npackage for a Wireless LAN. It describes the adversarys goals and possible actions they might \\ntake to achieve those goals in this example targeted system. \\nSection 5 provides our analysis of adversary goals and what a defender hopes to achieve against \\nan adversarys actions. This analysis leads us to conclude that the most effective point at which to \\napply cyber resiliency mitigations is the Production and Deployment phase because this reduces \\nthe number of attacks overall. The best place to gain information about adversary targets and \\nactivities are both the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase and the Production \\nand Deployment phase. This is where the adversary activity is focused. This section contains \\nrecommendations for cyber resiliency mitigations that can be applied to systems throughout the \\nacquisition life cycle and where we believe those mitigations are most effective. \\nIn addition to the recommended mitigations in Section 5, all potentially applicable cyber \\nresiliency techniques are listed in Appendix E, associated with each acquisition life cycle phase, \\nadversary goals and defender goals. These tables serve as a starting point as an SSE analyzes a \\nsystem for supply chain attacks and the application of cyber resiliency mitigations. SSEs should \\nfurther tailor this guidance to the specific system or components being assessed and provide \\nsecurity guidance to developers, security architects, security assessments and network defenders. \\nTo assist with this tailoring, refer to the example of supply chain attacks on an operational \\nnetwork component (using the Wireless LAN Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) \\ncapability package) provided in Section 5.4. This example describes each stage of the acquisition \\nlife cycle and applies the most effective resiliency techniques to thwart an attack on the \\ncomponents of this solution. vii Finally, Section 6 contains a summary and next steps. viii ix Background2\\nThis section introduces key definitions and frameworks used throughout the paper to characterize \\nsupply chain attacks, when they occur, what the adversary wants to accomplish and the best way \\nto defend against them. It also describes the DoDI 5000.02 [4] acquisition lifecycle and the cyber \\nattack lifecycle (CAL). For supply chain, the CAL is used as a structure of a cyber campaign \\nagainst a mission system where the cyber campaign spans the acquisition life cycle. A large \\nbody of work exists on Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) and was consulted for this \\nanalysis. A subset of this body of work was analyzed and is listed together with their \\napplicability in Appendix C. Supply Chain2.1\\nThe Information and Communications Technology (ICT) supply chain is defined in NIST 800-\\n161 [5] as a linked set of resources and processes between acquirers, integrators, and suppliers \\nthat begins with the design of ICT products and services and extends through development, \\nsourcing, manufacturing, handling, and delivery of ICT products and services to the acquirer. \\nThis supply chain can include vendors, manufacturing facilities, logistics providers, distribution \\ncenters, distributors, wholesalers, and other organizations involved in the manufacturing, \\nprocessing, design and development, handling and delivery of the products, or service providers \\ninvolved in the operation, management, and delivery of the services.\\nThe Defense Science Board (DSB) identifies three interconnected supply chains for DoD \\nweapons systems acquisitions [6]: (1) the global commercial supply chain, which is the source of \\nmost microelectronics; (2) the DoD acquisition supply chain, which is designed by the prime \\ncontractor; and (3) the DoD sustainment supply chain, which includes aftermarket suppliers. \\nThese supply chains are also relevant to ICT systems. For example, the global commercial \\nsupply chain also includes sources of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software and components \\n(e.g., operating systems, servers, routers). The DoD acquisition supply chain includes systems \\nused by the Program Office to define and track compliance with requirements, systems operated \\nby the Prime or Integration contractor to manage information related to the mission system, \\nsystems operated by the Prime or Integration contractor to develop the mission system, and \\nmaintenance systems. Supply Chain Attack 2.2\\nA Supply Chain Attack is defined for this paper as an intentional malicious action (e.g., \\ninsertion, substitution or modification) taken to create and ultimately exploit a vulnerability in \\nInformation and Communication Technology (hardware, software, firmware) at any point within \\nthe supply chain with the primary goal of disrupting or surveilling a mission using cyber \\nresources. This definition is based on the definition found in [3].\\nAs part of an attack, an adversary wants to achieve success in: inserting malware, tainted hardware, or false information into the supply chain,1.\\nsubstituting a bad or corrupt component for a good one, or2.\\nmodifying an existing component to affect its performance adversely (e.g., degrade, deny, 3.\\nmake unreliable, or cause to malfunction harmfully). The Defense Science Board Task Force on Cyber Supply Chain [6] identifies several reasons for the x 4 A tainted product as defined in Open Trusted Technology Provider Standard (O-TTPS) Version 1.1, Mitigating Maliciously \\nTainted and Counterfeit Products is a product that is produced by the provider and is acquired through a providers authorized \\nchannel but has been tampered with maliciously. [28] rising importance of supply chain attacks ranging from the increasing complexity of the \\nprogrammable electronic components to the extended lifetime of system configurations. This \\nreport cites the heavy reliance on integrated circuits produced outside the United States and the \\nfact that most PPPs do not carry over to the sustainment phase.\\nIn the DoDI 5200.44 [8] definition of supply chain risk, it states the adversary may sabotage, \\nmaliciously introduce unwanted function, or otherwise subvert the design, integrity, \\nmanufacturing, production, distribution, installation, operation, or maintenance of a system to \\nsurveil, deny, disrupt, or otherwise degrade the function, use, or operation of such system.\\nThis can happen at any phase of the acquisition lifecycle pictured in Figure 1 below. The method \\nof an attacker in this context is to gain access to the supply chain, execute a malicious insertion, \\nsubstitution, or modification of ICT, and achieve persistence until the altered component is a part \\nof an operational mission and/or system. \\nThis paper focuses on supply chain attacks that are operationally successful. Often a supply \\nchain attack is thought of as successful if the insertion, substitution or modification is completed. \\nHowever, for true success in the operational environment, an adversary uses the supply chain \\nentry point to control, execute and maintain the software, hardware or firmware containing that \\nmalicious modification in order to impact the mission operations. DoD Acquisition Lifecycle2.3\\nThe DoD Acquisition Lifecycle ( [4], Figure 1) represents a series of phases, separated by \\nmilestones and decision points, that an acquisition program moves through from conception to \\nultimate operational use and disposal. Adversaries can initiate and conduct malicious activities \\nduring any and all of these phases. Some of those activities can take the form of supply chain \\nattacks. Ensuring the integrity and security of the supply chain is paramount to the development \\nand operation of a secure and resilient platform. If an adversary can attack the supply chain and \\ntaint4 components, insert malicious compenents into the mission system, or otherwise undermine \\nthe ability of the as-delived mission system to meet its requirements, the adversary can \\ncompromise the operational system before or during its use. Figure 1. DoD Acquisition Lifecycle Cyber Attack Lifecycle2.4\\nThe cyber-attack lifecycle (CAL), first articulated by Lockheed Martin [9] as the cyber kill \\nchain, depicts the stages of a cyber campaign against a mission system. These stages are what an \\nadversary does to achieve the objectives of establishing, using and maintaining (or removing) a xi 5 Actions in each stage have defined objectives. Each action has one or more Indicators. Objectives and representative examples \\nof actions are included in the published lexicon. However, these published examples are focused on a mission system in the O&S \\nstage and do not include supply chain attacks. presence in an enterprise information infrastructure [10]. The stages are shown in Figure 2 \\nbelow and are: Reconnaissance the adversary gathers information and identifies a target; Weaponize the attack is put in a form",
