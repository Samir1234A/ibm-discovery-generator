  "text": "largely to the overhead of the \\nconsensus process. One solution to increase the transaction speed of a blockchain is through the \\nuse of state channels. A state channel is a bi-directional channel between parties. Messages in the channel take the \\nform of transactions. Parties sign messages in the channel and anchor certain transactions to the \\nblockchain at specific checkpoints, making the series of interactions leading to the final \\ntransaction impossible to refute later. The majority of these transactions take place entirely off the blockchain and exclusively between \\nthe participants, meaning they are cheap and very fast to execute compared to on-chain \\npayments. (What are State Channels, 2016) 17 The open-source project Raiden Network (Raiden Network, 2017) has deployed initial support \\nfor state channels on Ethereum; however, current efforts are focused primarily on token \\ntransfers. 8.3 Bulk Data Storage \\nBlockchains are not designed to store large data. Information sharing within the enterprise will \\nrequire the ability to manage large data without directly storing it on the blockchain. One \\nalternative is to store large data in external decentralized storage such as the InterPlanetary File \\nSystem (IPFS) (IPFS Distributed Web, 2016) and use a hash fingerprint of the document in a \\ntransaction on the blockchain as a reference to the externally stored content. MITRE has \\nconducted initial experiments using this approach with moderate success. Other efforts, such as the BigchainDB (BigchainDB, 2017) project, are working to connect the \\nimmutability and decentralization of blockchain technology with traditional database technology \\nto create a best-of-breed approach for the enterprise. 8.4 Connecting Blockchains \\nAs more organizations deploy blockchain solutions there will be a need to allow multiple parallel \\nblockchains to interoperate. This can be difficult depending on transaction models and the \\nvarious consensus algorithms used by blockchains. Various open-source projects, such as Cosmos (Cosmos Whitepaper, 2017) and Polkadot \\n(Polkadot, 2017), are working on solutions to provide interoperability between blockchains, but \\ncurrent efforts are predominately focused on public blockchains. Conclusion \\nBlockchain technology is evolving at a very rapid pace. Understanding the core components of \\nthe technology and how they work together is critical to tracking the state of the art. While each \\ncomponent plays a critical role in the technology stack, consensus is at the heart of the system \\nand important to understand. Carefully choosing the right consensus algorithm based on the \\ndesired level of trust and security will be critical to a successful blockchain application. While public blockchains provide the most security as they are designed to operate in a trust-less \\nenvironment, government users will be most interested in a permissioned blockchain. However, \\nthe nature of a permissioned blockchain requires careful planning and governance to establish \\nthe parties participating in the consensus process. Without proper governance, there may be a \\npossibility of politically centralizing some of the key functionality of the blockchain, limiting its \\ncapabilities, and providing a false sense of security. As more look to permissioned blockchains to modernize traditional applications, there are \\nseveral requirements that need to be addressed. For example, privacy and confidentiality on the \\nblockchain, transaction scalability, and blockchain-to-blockchain connectivity. While theres \\nongoing active research in these areas across several open-source communities, permissioned \\nblockchains need to further evolve to fully meet the needs of the government user. 18 Bibliography \\nBigchainDB.
