Approved for Public Release; Distribution \\nUnlimited 18-0982 \\nAll rights reserved. \\n2 Executive Summary \\nThe Australian Cyber Security Growth Network (AustCyber) contracted with The MITRE \\nCorporation (MITRE) to assess the applicability of the National Institute of Standards and \\nTechnology (NIST) Cybersecurity Practice Guide for Mobile Device Security: Cloud and Hybrid \\nBuilds (the Practice Guide) to organizations within Australia to consider opportunities for \\nstandards harmonization and proactive regulatory reform. \\nMobile devices, most frequently in the form of smartphones and tablets, are a key feature of \\nAustralias society and its business activitiessecuring those devices and the data they carry is \\ncritical. While MITRE has considered the role of government and larger enterprises in this \\nreport, considerable attention is paid to small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) due to their \\nimportant role in the Australian economy. Many of these organizations have limited operational \\nknowledge of cybersecurity. Australian organizations, and particularly SMEs, need practical \\nadvice that helps them understand their need for cybersecurity, along with easily consumable \\nguidelines that are affordable and easy to implement. \\nMITRE found that the abundance of standards and guidelines available to Australian \\norganizations at both the federal and state/territory level caused confusion around what advice \\nshould be adopted. Cyberaware organizations are overregulating, doing nothing, or applying a \\nmixture of domestic and international standards for guidelines. The result is inefficient and is a \\nbarrier to improving Australias cyber resilience. The Australian government can begin to \\naddress this issue by taking steps to harmonize the guidelines it provides to industry and other \\nlevels of Australian government. \\nThis report is a starting point for Australian government and industry to further examine the \\nexisting overlaps and gaps that Australian organizations face in following the multiple \\ncybersecurity requirements and guidelines. MITRE found that the Practice Guide is helpful to \\nAustralian organizations, including government, because it offers comprehensive standards-\\nbased guidelines. The Practice Guide attempts to provide practical, real-world security guidelines \\nthat most organizations can adopt on unclassified networks. For smaller organizations, the \\nPractice Guide focuses on the use of cloud architecture on mobile devices, while more mature \\norganizations are given guidelines on the use of hybrid architecture. \\nMITRE identified the Australian Signals Directorates (ASD) Information Security Manual \\n(ISM) and the Essential Eight mitigation strategies as having the most relevance to mobile device \\nsecurity for organizations in Australia, as well as the Office of the Australian Information \\nCommissioners (OAIC) guide to securing personal information when considering the recent \\nPrivacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017. These three resources were mapped \\nto the Practice Guide to identify overlaps and gaps. \\nOverall the ISM had the strongest relationship to the Practice Guide, and the gaps identified are \\nlargely due to the difference in the intended audience. The Practice Guide was designed for \\nindustry, whereas the ISM is focused on defense and federal agencies. The Essential Eight were \\nfound to be useful guidelines for mobile device security, with the Practice Guide security \\ncharacteristics addressing six of the eight Essential Eight strategies. The OAIC guide to securing \\n3 personal information is also relevant for SMEs concerned about mobile device security, though it \\nalso has broader applicability. \\nIn summary, our analysis showed that the Practice Guide provided useful and practical \\nguidelines on the specific issue of mobile device security within the Australian ecosystem. The \\nPractice Guide can be a useful adjunct to the existing set of Australian guidelines and could serve \\nas a preeminent and comprehensive reference for organizations seeking to improve the \\ncybersecurity of mobile devices. Furthermore, the Practice Guide could become even more \\nuseful for SMEs with several modifications described at the conclusion of this report. MITRE \\nrecommends that AustCyber, a government-funded and industry-facing independent entity, take \\nthe lead in facilitating intergovernmental and multistakeholder discussions on cybersecurity \\nstandards harmonization both domestically and internationally (the latter is especially relevant \\nfor organizations that export and/or have multinational operations), with mobile device security \\nserving as the initial use case because of its broad applicability across both SMEs and larger \\nenterprises. \\n4 Table of Contents \\n Introduction \\nICT Arrangements \\n5 Device Integrity \\n6 Introduction \\nAustralian organizations attempting to secure their cyberenvironment face a complex mix of \\nregulations, standards, and guidance. Businesses that desire to do business with governments \\nface competing standards that are recommended, if not required, by different government \\nagencies. A perceived lack of practical cybersecurity guidance has left some businesses \\nstruggling to comply with stringent security controls that exceed the level of security necessary \\nfor their environment and often with the levels of security appropriate for implementing their \\nsolutions in customer environments. \\nFurther complicating matters is the fact that the Australian economy is driven by small- and \\nmedium-size enterprises (SMEs). The criteria defining an SME varies. The Australian Bureau of \\nStatistics (ABS) defines an SME as a business employing 20 people or fewer, while the \\nAustralian Tax Office (ATO) defines a small business as an entity with less than AU$10 million \\nin yearly turnover [1] and a large business with turnover of more than AU$250 million. In fact, \\nthe Australian governments 2014 Financial System Inquiry report found that Australias two \\nmillion small- to mid-size organizations employ almost 70 percent of the total workforce and \\ncontribute half of the output of the private sector [2]. It is unrealistic to expect businesses of this \\nsize to comply with inconsistent regulations, standards, or guidance that is better suited for large \\nenterprises with dedicated IT staffs; however, the health and security of SMEs impacts not only \\nindividual businesses but government and larger corporations as well. \\nSME owners rely heavily on mobile devices to carry out key business functions. These SMEs \\nneed practical advice to help them be aware of cyber risks when interacting with mobile devices \\nand to implement guidance that will prevent, detect, and respond to cybersecurity incidents. \\nThere are some high-level cybersecurity best practices available, such as Keep your business \\nsafe from cyberthreats and the Stay Smart Online website [3][4]. Each of these online \\ngovernment resources provides valuable broad-level cybersecurity information. However, there \\nis a need for practical information for more specific business functions facing SMEs. Mobile \\ndevices, most frequently in the form of smartphones and tablets, are a key feature of Australias \\nsociety and its business activitiessecuring those devices and the data they carry is critical, yet \\nit is not clear how SMEs should best address this challenge. Mobile device cybersecurity is \\nfurther complicated by the impact of increased cloud service usage to store data that is critical to \\nbusiness operations, as highlighted in a report from the Australian Bureau of Statistics [5]. The During industry consultations, participants noted several resources that provided practical \\ncybersecurity guidance for mobile devices. The Center for Internet Security (CIS), a nonprofit \\norganization whose mission is to identify, develop, validate, promote, and sustain best-practice \\nsolutions for cyberdefense, was mentioned as a resource. The CIS produces benchmark best-\\npractice security configuration guides on many topics, including mobile devices. Other examples \\nthat were mentioned were the United Kingdoms National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) Cyber \\nEssentials self-help website and the business-focused mobile device security guidance produced \\nby the Australian governments Stay Smart Online website. While these publications are \\nsomewhat similar in nature to the NCCoE practice guides, they lack a strong relationship with a \\ncommon, internationally accepted cybersecurity framework. \\n7 activities conducted to develop this report explore a possible option for providing more specific \\npractical cybersecurity advice for Australian SMEs. 1.1 Background \\nThis report leverages the Mobile Device Security Project performed by the National \\nCybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) in the United States. The NCCoE is a public-\\nprivate partnership that creates practical cybersecurity solutions by using a standards-based \\napproach. NCCoE uses currently available commercial technology to produce easily adaptable \\nsolutions to address cybersecurity challenges facing industry. Example solutions or reference \\narchitectures are documented in a practice guide that contains three parts: Volume AExecutive Summary, a high-level overview of the project, including \\nsummaries of the challenge, solution, and benefits Volume BApproach, Architecture, and Security Characteristics, a deep dive into \\nchallenge and solution, including approach, architecture, and security mapping to \\nrelevant standards Volume CHow-to guide providing detailed instructions on how to implement the \\nsolution, including components, installation, configuration, operation, and maintenance The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Practice Guide for \\nMobile Device Security: Cloud and Hybrid Builds (the Practice Guide), also known as NIST \\nSpecial Publication 1800-4, is among the cybersecurity practice guides produced by the NCCoE. \\nAll NCCoE practice guides leverage the United States NIST-published Framework for \\nImproving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, commonly referred to as the Cybersecurity \\nFramework, or CSF.",

  "text": "state and local \\ngovernment purchases of information and communications technology devices \\n(computer work stations, servers, laptops, routers, printers, smart phones, tablets and \\nassociated software) grew from $50 billion past $70 billion to about $75 billion annually \\nin 2017, to reach an anticipated $100 billion per year before 2025. This makes ICT procurement, along with real estate costs and vehicles, one of the top \\nthree acquisition areas of every jurisdiction in the nation; ICT is what citizens tax \\npayments are being used to pay for. At the Federal level, the statutory scheme outlined \\nearlier has produced a model of controls and reviews intended to allow most federal \\nagencies to buy commercial, off-the-shelf ICT products at favorable terms and pricing. \\nNonetheless, over $100 billion a year is spent on ICT by the Federal government; the \\nrecognized presence of costly mishaps, poor negotiation, faulty pricing, supply chain \\nabuse and counterfeiting, not to mention outright insider theft, fraud and other \\nmisconduct has resulted in an explosion in the ICT-related work of each agencys 9 See Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System Inspector General, as well as the Congressional spending watch-dog agency, the \\nGovernment Accountability Office (GAO). Statutes such as the Clinger-Cohen Act and FITARA provide direction to Federal \\nacquisition officers on how to negotiate and obtain desired devices at the best value. \\nTotal life cycle cost and best value negotiation have become commonplace in \\ncommercial contracting as a result of programs and practices evolved in federal \\nagencies to assure the best use of tax dollars; yet, much dissatisfaction remains in the \\nagencies, the Congressional funding committees and the watch dogs. Due to its size, \\ncritical missions and enormous IT budget, the Defense Department has evolved a \\nvariety of acquisition practices under the Defense Acquisition Regulations (DFAR) \\nintended to make program planners and acquisition officers tasks easier. One of the invaluable tools which has evolved in the wake of various statutory directions \\nhas been the Program Protection Plan (PPP).9 The PPP is a planning and tracking tool \\nconsolidating all protection efforts associated with a sensitive ICT acquisition in the \\nDefense Department, but over time it has evolved to be used across the breadth of the \\nnational security community, as well as Federal agencies seeking to exercise close \\ncontrol over their ICT investments. As such, it would find useful applicability in state \\ncourts, law enforcement, corrections, taxation and other domains. It is designed to deny \\naccess to Critical Program Information (CPI) to anyone not authorized, not having a \\nneed-to-know and prevent inadvertent disclosure of leading edge technology to foreign \\ninterests, by tracking each engagement, document and other transactional element \\nduring the planning, consummation and deployment of an ICT procurement. DoD Departmental guidance describes the process used to prepare a PPP when one is \\nrequired: Any program, product, technology demonstrator, or other item developed as part of a separate \\nacquisition process, and used as a component, subsystem, or modification of another program, \\nshould publish a PPP.\\nEffectiveness of the PPP is highly dependent upon the quality and currency of information available to \\nthe program office.\\nCoordination between the Program Management Office (PMO) and supporting [law enforcement] and \\nsecurity activities is critical to ensure that any changes in the system CPI, threat, or environmental \\nconditions are communicated to the proper organizations.\\n[Law enforcement activities] supporting the program protection effort should provide timely notification \\nto the PM of any information on adverse interests targeting their CPI without waiting for a periodic \\nproduction request. Adoption of the PPP tool to support sensitive and large-volume/high value acquisitions is \\nonly one of multiple tools and techniques available to revise state acquisition model to \\nadd technology expertise/best practices throughout the ICT life cycle of system \\nrequirement definition, procurement planning, acquisition, deployment and operations \\nand retirement. Institution of Inspector General (IG) functions http://acqnotes.com/acqNote/critical-program-information\\nhttp://acqnotes.com/acqNote/program-management-office-pmoprogram-management In addition to protecting the interests of citizens through expanded civil jurisdiction and \\nimproving the potential ROI of individual procurements, another tool to add the sub-Federal ICT \\narsenal is an expert body to investigate, prosecute and recover ill-gotten gains in the course of \\nICT acquisition and use. Technology acquisition is complex: it goes wrong even when well \\nplanned and managed. Along with the dramatic growth in total IT acquisition by local \\ngovernments have come increased cost-draining complexities, vendor problems and outright \\nfraud and abuse in the acquisition and deployment of Information and Communications \\nTechnology systems to support local government operations These reported problems threaten to \\nobliterate the economic benefits of data automation and frequently result in distractions of \\ngovernments core mission of public service, all the expense of the taxpayer.\\nLocal governments are challenged to adapt to the responsibility of this growing stewardship of \\ncomplex IT infrastructure investments. One response to increasing ethical, financial and criminal \\nabuses in local government operations has been the establishment of local independent Inspectors \\nGeneral offices by a growing number of major urban municipalities and counties, including \\nChicago, Philadelphia, Yonkers, Jacksonville, Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach Counties \\nin Florida, Albuquerque, New Mexico, New Orleans and Montgomery County, Maryland.\\nThe dominant competing approach to the role of an Inspector General in local government is to \\ndo nothing. Other approaches in some jurisdictions include the use of local auditors offices or \\nfinancial crimes sections of local prosecutors. These, however, only focus on criminal behavior \\nor statutory violations of procurement procedures, not the broader abuses within the scope of IG \\ninvestigations.\\nIG offices may be established by statute, local ordinance, by the local executive, by a public \\ninitiative or even an NGO (for example, in Chicago, the IG effort has its roots in the independent \\nBetter Government Association). But the major competing approach today is inertia-the \\nabsence of any investment by local governments in rooting out fraud, waste and abuse.\\nThe skill sets for local IGs typically are focused on auditing and investigations, supported by law \\nenforcement and regulatory/legal policy. Leadership and professional staff typically hold terms \\nthat transcend executive and legislative terms. In the case of ICT procurement fraud, operational, \\nproduct and technical expertise are clearly desirable.\\nThe IG role itself may be selected by a blue-ribbon panel, as is the case in Miami-Dade. In \\nMontgomery County, a nominating committee of citizens appointed by the County Executive \\nmakes recommendations of a slate of candidates to the County Council who select the final \\nchoice.\\nWhile the principal area of conflict in roles arises with respect to criminal investigations and \\njurisdiction between prosecutors and the IG, these issues are typically addressable through a clear \\nMoU between the agencies describing the role of the IG in any investigation prior to and once an \\ncriminal charge has been filed. Criminal investigatory powers, including subpoena power and \\ndirect prosecution for non-cooperation are common.\\nThe core capability of a successful IG function is the offices ability to investigate and report on \\nunacceptable practice; the metric of success is a record of changed behavior by acquiring \\nagencies of government.\\nThe establishment of the function will eliminate the limitation engendered by its absence; \\nInspectors General act to identify and investigate waste and inefficient expenditure of public \\nfunds, which while related to roles filled by ethics officers and prosecutors, are not their \\nresponsibility. In the absence of IG roles, the investigation, auditing and remediation of abuses of \\nlocal government operations could continue undetected and unaddressed, resulting in continuing \\ncost to taxpayers. Significant successes are being achieved by the jurisdictions which have \\nestablished local IG offices. Fusion Centers for IOT Flaw Information Sharing The fourth capability in this suite of ICT enhancements is to repurposeor more \\npreciselyexpand the jurisdiction of the 79 existing Fusion Centers which were \\nestablished across the nation in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and have continued to \\noperate since that time. While the principal purposes of these centers established by \\nthe interagency DoJ/DHS Fusion Center capability were counter-terrorism intelligence \\nand drug interdiction, their structure and capabilities, coupled with multi-agency state \\nand local representation make them an ideal additional eyes and ears function in \\nsupport of improved state and local ICT environments. Because they maintain both an intra-state and national cross-Fusion Centers \\ncommunications capacity, these centers can provide relief for a chronic problem of the \\nICT environment: the failure to promptly share and communicate the details of systems \\nand networks failures, attacks and other anomalies. By sharing in real-time the \\nexistence of flaws in IT systems, software and services, these centers can become a \\nbackbone element of a nationwide sharing environment long contemplated by the ISAC \\ncommunity, the Sector Coordinating Councils and the ISAOs developed under the \\nDHS/NIST Cyber Framework There is nothing particularly magical or unprecedented by any of these proposals. Civil \\njurisdiction debates around Federal preemption have swirled for years. The importation \\nof federal best practices for ICT procurements that are relevant to the concerns of states \\nand localities is neither unduly complex nor itself unprecedented. {States have been free \\nto utilize GSA schedule procurement vehicles in a number of product areas for two \\ndecades.} As discussed the number of localities adopting local Inspectors General \\ncapabilities is now perhaps in the hundreds, and growing. And Fusion centers",
