  "text": "a guy out at a higher altitude. Prob not a concern in real life \\nbecause programs would be in place to standardize.\\n(NCT) (Aircraft in front of CSL) what if I needed to take aircraft off final to get them in the \\nzone, no tools to show me how much I need, if I needed a short vector to set aircraft in \\nzone.\\n(NCT) Not enough space for final controller to make speed adjustments if needed. Results Topic 3: Monitor Configurations6.4\\nThe analyses in this section examine the Combined and Separate Monitor configurations for the \\nDay 1-2 Nominal scenarios. No lateral deviations were deliberately introduced; further monitor \\nconfiguration results for these off-nominal conditions are described in Section 5.6. As described in Table 4-5, monitor configuration for the Day 1-2 Nominal scenarios was divided \\nby simulation day. That is, the same monitor configuration was used for the first day, then the \\nother configuration was used for the second day. As the IM PA Tool configurations and \\nscenarios were varied in the same way between the two days, monitor configuration was the \\nprimary difference. Therefore, differences between the days with respect to the various metrics \\nshould be primarily attributable to the difference in monitor configuration. These metrics \\ninclude: Workload, Clarity of Roles and Responsibilities, Spacing Issue Detection, and \\nEffectiveness and Acceptability. Workload Acceptability6.4.1\\nAt the end of Day 1 and Day 2 (QT2), controllers were asked if their overall workload today was \\nacceptable. Their responses were then examined with respect to monitor configuration. \\nResponse Means and Standard Deviations are summarized in Table 5-19. Scale responses are \\nshown in Figure 5-28. Only Week 2-3 TRACON controller responses were included in the \\nanalysis. Table 5-19. Controller Responses to Acceptability of Overall Workload (Nominal Scenarios) Monitor Configuration xxxvii\\n Separate Combined\\nSample Size (n) 7 7 Mean (M) 96.1 95.7 Standard Deviation (SD) 3.8 6.7 Figure 5-28. My overall workload today was acceptable. Note: o indicates Week 1 TRACON controller responses for reference. These are not included in the M and SD computations. All Week 2-3 TRACON controllers agreed their overall workload was acceptable for both the \\nSeparate Monitor configuration (M=96.1; SD=3.8) and Combined Monitor configuration \\n(M=95.7; SD=6.7). No practical difference was observed between the two monitor \\nconfigurations. With respect to workload by monitor configuration, open-ended comments included: (Non-NCT TRACON / Separate Monitor configuration) Busier than [Combined], due to \\nrequired speed control. The IM PA was a very minimal part of the workload.\\n(Non-NCT TRACON / Separate Monitor configuration) Workload this low could lull a \\ncontroller into complacency.\\n(Non-NCT TRACON / Separate Monitor configuration) Somewhat complex with spacing \\ncomplexity between different runways and types. Not overworked, but not in drone \\nzone.\\n(Non-NCT TRACON / Combined Monitor configuration) I felt better about working both \\ncombined. The extra traffic helped me to stay focused. Clarity of Roles and Responsibilities6.4.2\\nAt the end of Day 1 and Day 2 (QT2), controllers were asked if when monitoring today, my roles \\nand responsibilities with respect to the IM Lead Aircraft, IM Trail Aircraft, and Other Aircraft \\nwere clear. Their responses were examined with respect to monitor configuration. Response \\nMeans and Standard Deviations are summarized in Table 5-20. Scale responses are shown in \\nFigure 5-29. Only Week 2-3 TRACON controller responses were included in the analysis. Table 5-20. Controller Responses to Clarity of Roles and Responsibilities xxxviii\\n Monitor Configuration Separate Combined\\nIM Lead Aircraft Sample Size (n) 7 7 Mean (M) 96.7 93.9 Standard Deviation (SD) 3.6 8.3 IM Trail Aircraft\\nSample Size (n) 7 7 Mean (M) 96.9 93.4 Standard Deviation (SD) 3.6 8.0 Other Aircraft\\nSample Size (n) 7 7 Mean (M) 96.7 92.4 Standard Deviation (SD) 3.6 8.5 Figure 5-29. When monitoring today, my roles and responsibilities with respect to the IM Lead Aircraft, \\nIM Trail Aircraft, and Other Aircraft were clear. Note: o indicates Week 1 TRACON controller responses for reference. These are not included in the M and SD computations. All Week 2-3 TRACON controllers agreed their roles and responsibilities were clear with respect \\nto all aircraft for both monitor configurations. Though no practical differences were observed in \\nthe responses, the overall response variability was slightly greater for the Combined Monitor \\nconfiguration. Spacing Issue Detection6.4.3\\nAt the end of Day 1 and Day 2 (QT2), controllers were asked if they were able to detect in a \\nsufficient amount of time when spacing / separation issues were developing within an IM PA xxxix\\n Aircraft Pair and Between Other Combinations. Their responses were examined with respect to \\nmonitor configuration. Response Means and Standard Deviations are summarized in Table 5-21 \\n. Scale responses are shown in Figure 5-30. Only Week 2-3 TRACON controller responses were \\nincluded in the analysis. Table 5-21. Controller Responses to Detection of Developing Spacing / Separation Issues Monitor Configuration Separate Combined\\nWithin an IM PA Aircraft Pair Sample Size (n) 7 7 Mean (M) 94.7 90.7 Standard Deviation (SD) 7.5 9.2 Between Other Combinations\\nSample Size (n) 7 7 Mean (M) 87.6 79.4 Standard Deviation (SD) 14.7 13.1 Figure 5-30. I was able to detect in a sufficient amount of time when spacing / separation issues were \\ndeveloping within an IM PA Aircraft Pair and Between Other Combinations. Note: o indicates Week 1 TRACON controller responses for reference. These are not included in the M and SD computations. All Week 2-3 TRACON controllers agreed they were able to detect in a sufficient amount of time \\nwhen spacing / separation issues were developing within an IM PA pair and Between Other \\nCombinations for both monitor configurations. Though no practical differences were observed \\nin the responses between the two monitor configurations, the means were slightly higher and \\noverall response variability was slightly lower for IM PA pairs versus other aircraft pair \\ncombinations. With respect to spacing issue detection, open-ended comments included: (Non-NCT TRACON / Separate Monitor configuration) The pairs were easier to determine xl\\n and required less focus.\\n(Non-NCT TRACON / Combined Monitor configuration) The IM PA pair did not have to be \\nwatched nearly as closely which allowed focus on the other a/c spacing.\\n(Non-NCT TRACON / Combined Monitor configuration) It is more difficult to determine \\ndistance between pairs than it is within pairs. Effectiveness and Comfort6.4.4\\nAt the end of Day 1 and Day 2 (QT2), controllers were asked if given the appropriate training \\nand IM PA-related tools, IM PA operations can be effectively monitored by the number of \\npositions I experienced today. Their responses were then examined with respect to monitor \\nconfiguration. Response Means and Standard Deviations are summarized in Table 5-22. Scale \\nresponses are shown in Figure 5-31. Only Week 2-3 TRACON controller responses were included \\nin the analysis. Table 5-22. Controller Responses to Effective Monitoring Monitor Configuration Separate Combined\\nSample Size (n) 7 7 Mean (M) 96.6 90.9 Standard Deviation (SD) 3.9 9.3 Figure 5-31. Given the appropriate training and IM PA-related tools, IM PA operations can be \\neffectively monitored by the number of positions I experienced today. Note: o indicates Week 1 TRACON controller responses for reference. These are not included in the M and SD computations. All Week 2-3 TRACON controllers agreed IM PA operations can be effectively monitored by both \\nthe Separate Monitor configuration (M=96.6; SD=3.9) and Combined Monitor configuration \\n(M=90.9; SD=9.3). Though no practical differences were observed in the responses, the overall \\nresponse variability was slightly greater for the Combined Monitor configuration. With respect to monitoring effectiveness by configuration, open-ended comments included: (NCT / Separate Monitor configuration) Depends on traffic, but two monitors \\n[controllers] seem better than one. xli\\n (Non-NCT TRACON / Separate Monitor configuration) Maybe overly monitored, but \\ndefinitely effective.\\n(NCT / Separate Monitor configuration) I feel it could be done by final by itself.\\n(Non-NCT TRACON / Combined Monitor configuration) Better today with one monitor. --------------------------------- At the end of Day 2 (QT3), after experiencing the nominal scenarios across all IM PA Tool and \\nmonitor configurations, controllers were asked if given the appropriate training and IM PA-\\nrelated tools, a single (Combined) Monitor controller can effectively ensure separation across \\nboth approaches during IM PA operations. Responses are shown for all TRACON (NCT and non-\\nNCT combined) and Tower Only. Response Means and Standard Deviations are summarized in \\nTable 5-23. Scale responses are shown in Figure 5-32. Table 5-23. Controller Responses to whether a Single (Combined) Monitor Controller can Effectively \\nEnsure Separation Across Both Approaches Participant Experience TRACON Tower\\nSample Size (n) 10 2 Mean (M) 84.2 89.0 Standard Deviation (SD) 15.6  Figure 5-32. Given the appropriate training and IM PA-related tools, a single (Combined) Monitor \\ncontroller can effectively ensure separation across both approaches during IM PA operations. Note: o indicates NCT controller responses. The majority (90%) of TRACON controllers agreed (M=84.2; SD=15.6) that a single Monitor \\ncontroller can effectively ensure separation across both approaches during IM PA operations. \\nOne NCT controller neither agreed nor disagreed and noted that more runs as a single monitor \\nwould be helpful to evaluate this better. With respect to the effectiveness of a Combined Monitor position, open-ended comments \\nincluded: (Non-NCT TRACON) I think it would be reasonable, especially when the final controller \\nsets up a well-spaced final. xlii\\n (Non-NCT TRACON) Depends on airport, but KSFO",
