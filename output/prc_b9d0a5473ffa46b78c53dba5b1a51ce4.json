  "text": "provided directly on the surveillance display. Such information will help the controller\\ndetermine which aircraft are part of an IM operation, what their role is (i.e., trail or lead), and\\nthe status of the IM operation (e.g., active). Past work examined this topic and is reviewed next. 2-20 In Bone et al. (2007), a HITL simulation of an achieve-by IM operation is reported that was a\\ntransitional implementation that had no active controller involvement in the set-up of IM or in\\nissuing the IM information. The UPS operations center provided the IM information to the trail\\naircraft based on the arrival sequence and the ASG that was agreed-upon with the TRACON.\\nThe controllers monitored IM and intervened when necessary. The simulation was supporting\\nan early field implementation where controller tools would not be available in time. In this\\nsimulation, controllers did not know which aircraft were conducting IM, only that some in the\\nstream were capable. Based on the results, the authors noted that controllers may need: to know which aircraft are actually (versus potentially) conducting IM, a better understanding of IM aircraft behavior (e.g., relationship between IM speeds\\nflown and the ASG), to know whether or not the ASG can be achieved, and more information to determine when an intervention in the IM operation is necessary. In a follow-on simulation, during capture then maintain IM operations, Penhallegon and Bone\\n(2008) had pilots report when conducting IM, instead of having the controller assume. While\\nthe controllers did not have IM-specific display features, they were reported to use existing\\ndisplay features to flag aircraft that were conducting IM. The controllers did not report the\\nmonitoring and intervention needs reported in the previous simulation. However, this\\ndifference may be because maintain operations may lend themselves better to monitoring the\\nstatus of IM than do achieve operations because aircraft are on a common route. EUROCONTROL IM-related research with controllers (e.g., Aligne et al., 2003) used basically the\\nsame tool set (Figure 2-8). Controllers were informed of IM equipage through the flight plan.\\nFor the surveillance display IM features, circles were placed around the trail (larger circle) and\\nthe lead (smaller circle) aircraft. A line linking the aircraft was also available as an optional\\ndisplay element. The line included a numeric value of the current spacing between the aircraft\\nin distance or time. The features were orange when the lead aircraft was being identified and\\nselected by the trail aircraft flight crew and was green when IM became active. Controllers\\nreported that the tools were useful (Aligne et al., 2003; Rognin et al., 2005). Figure 2-8. EUROCONTROL IM Controller Information [Reprinted from Aligne et al., 2003] 2-21 Benson et al. (2011) reported a simulation where center controller data blocks showed trail and\\nlead aircraft role and IM status: pending versus active (in the fourth line). IM eligibility was not\\nshown in the preferred IM window implementation (but was examined in an alternative\\nimplementation). A flyout window was also available that allowed controllers to initiate and\\nterminate IM and show the IM operation state and aircraft role in IM. It used color coding to\\ndifferentiate between the IM pending (clearance issued but not yet accepted by the flight crew)\\nand active states (Figure 2-9). Controllers used the option to initiate and terminate IM with the\\ndata block. The data blocks were reported to have provide IM situation awareness benefits.\\nMost controllers wanted the trail and lead identification and lead or trail role in data block and\\nthought it was part of a minimum set of information. Figure 2-9. MITRE IM Controller Data Block Information [Reprinted from Benson et al., 2011] Peterson et al. (2012) conducted a follow-on simulation and developed an alternative data\\nblock and fly-out menu for IM. In this implementation, the controller could accept or reject a\\nproposed IM operation, as well as change the status states of the IM operations. The status\\nstates shown were: capable (FC), pending (FP), active (FA), or terminated (FT). The flyout menu\\nwas where the proposal for the IM operation was rejected and where the status states were\\nchanged (Figure 2-10). The majority of controllers reported that the data block was their\\npreferred method for conducting IM operations, although controller responses appeared mixed 2-22 as to the necessity to display IM information in the data block. The majority of controllers\\nagreed that each of the states should be depicted. Figure 2-10. MITRE IM Controller Data Block Information [Reprinted from Peterson et al.,\\n2012] In Cabrall et al. (2012), IM status information for the IM trail aircraft was provided to TRACON\\ncontrollers in the second line of the data block, after the aircraft type. No IM equipped indicator\\nwas shown for the trail aircraft. A was used when aircraft were flying RTAs prior to starting\\nIM and an S was used when aircraft were conducting IM. Controllers manually updated the\\nstatus designators based on flight crew reports. Controllers found the status information itself,\\nas well as the need to manually update the status, acceptable. The information was rated as\\nhighly helpful and highly usable. However, controllers reported wanting a single input\\ncommand to toggle between the status states. The same method was used in the follow-on simulation reported in Callantine et al. (2012).\\nHowever, there were also conditions where the TSAS speed advisories were removed during IM\\nfor the IM trail aircraft. Both Center and TRACON controllers reported that the status\\ninformation was useful. In the third simulation of the series, data blocks for the Center\\ncontrollers had a /S indicator in the third line of the data block for the IM trail aircraft. This\\nsimulation added an IM equipped indicator for the trail aircraft. A command was used to turn\\nthe field magenta when IM started. A was included if the aircraft was flying the RTA prior to\\nIM. A command could be used to toggle between the states. The status information was passed\\nto the TRACON controller where the information was provided in the same field as the previous\\ntwo simulations (Callantine et al., 2012). The TRACON controllers provided high ratings for the\\nhelpfulness and their confidence in the IM status information. Center controller feedback was\\nnot reported. The authors note that there were some issues with setting the status, but the\\nreason for the issues was unclear from the report. In another simulation, Thipphavong et al., (2013) used a similar approach to that reported in\\nCallantine et al. (2012). Data blocks for the Center controllers had a /S indicator in the third 2-23 line of the data block to indicate IM capable for the trail aircraft. A command was used to turn\\nthe field magenta when IM started. TRACON controller IM designations in the data block were\\nnot described. The lead aircraft was sometimes identified in the data block for the lead aircraft\\ncontroller when both aircraft were not in the same sector. TRACON controllers reported that\\nthe TSAS speed advisories were less useful for IM operations than for non-IM operations, but\\nwere still somewhat useful. The IM status indicators were rated as more useful than the slot\\nmarkers by TRACON controllers, but the slot markers were still reported to be used 40% of the\\ntime. Controllers reported that they did not want to have other IM status indicators, such as\\nsuspended or terminated, in the data block. When the lead aircraft was identified for the\\ncontroller, IM operations were suspended less often and controllers confirmed they liked the\\ninformation. In the follow-on simulation, the indicators and their location changed for both center and\\nTRACON controllers (Callantine et al., 2013). Center controllers had the following information in\\nthe zero line of the data block: @ for IM-equipped, R when the aircraft was flying a RTA\\nprior to IM, and S for active IM operations. The @ symbol changed to magenta when the\\ncontroller issued the IM clearance and made an entry. The R and S indicators were shown\\nafter controller entry (Figure 2-11). For the TRACON controllers, the IM status was transfer from\\nthe center controller systems. In this simulation, the designators were: FIM [Flight deck-based\\nIM] for IM clearance issued, RTA when the aircraft was flying a RTA prior to IM, and SPC for\\nactive IM operations. The designators for this simulation were in the third line of the data block\\nreplacing the TSAS speed advisories and early / late indicator (Figure 2-12). This simulation had\\nwind-related issues that affected IM operations; however, both center and TRACON controllers\\nreported favorably on the IM status designators and the associated updating. Figure 2-11. Center Controller Data Block Information from Callantine et al. (2013) [Reprinted\\nfrom Callantine et al., 2013] 2-24 Figure 2-12. TRACON Controller Data Block Information from Callantine et al. (2013)\\n[Reprinted from Callantine et al., 2013] One of the final NASA simulations is reported in Baxley et al. (2016). As with past simulations,\\ncenter controllers had IM status information in the data block (top line) which included three\\nstatus levels: IM capable, IM issued, and IM active / reported paired. TRACON controllers had\\nIM status information in the data block including: IM issued (FIM) and (SPC) IM active /\\nreported paired. Overall, the controller reported the display elements as acceptable. The\\nauthors recommended indicating in the data block of the trail aircraft: (1) whether an aircraft is\\nIM capable, and (2) whether an IM clearance has been issued. In concept evaluations conducted in preparation for this HITL simulation, the IM information in\\nthe data block was examined. The IM information replaced the TSAS speed",
