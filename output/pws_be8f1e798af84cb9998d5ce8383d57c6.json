Table of Contents 1 Introduction \\nPutin Press Secretary Dmitri Peskov, referring to Kim Kardashians popularity, noted that a Twitter account able to reach millions of people can cause geopolitical chaos in just minutes. He \\nstated: shes got no intelligence, no interior ministry, no defense ministry, no K.G.B. \\nThis is the new reality: the global proliferation of the kinds of reach and influence \\nthat were once reserved for the great powers and, more recently, great media \\nconglomerates.1 Since the 1980s, Kremlin attitudes about the so-called information age have oscillated greatly. \\nDuring the days of the Soviet Union, media outlets and TV, to include Xerox and fax machines, \\nwere tightly controlled, since information was power. With the 1991 demise of the Soviet \\nUnion, Russian analysts quickly understood that cyberspace offered information access to \\nanyone with an Internet link. Seemingly unlimited data was available for free and individuals or \\ngroups could link up with those of similar interests (pro- or anti-government, etc.) and become \\ninfluential segments of society. Eventually Russias leadership became suspicious of information \\nout of their control, and began visualizing the hand of foreign media agents everywhere to \\ninfluence its citizens. Years later, that same leadership sees opportunities as well. The information age has become an \\nera capable of internal control (via legislation) and external influence, since in the latter case it \\nis possible to exploit populations in nations with open information systems and a democratic \\nstyle. This is done through a host of tactics (fake photos, use of Internet trolls, one-sided \\nreporting, etc.) that manipulate public opinion in tune with Russias interpretation of objective \\nreality. Through media outlets such as Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik, Russia accesses both \\ncompatriots located in other countries (in former Warsaw Pact nations or republics) and \\nnumerous external media markets, which happily accept Russian rubles and offer Russian TV \\npackages. The following discussion covers nine contemporary cyber/influence issues associated with \\nRussias military and civilian use of the Internet and television propaganda. The purpose is to \\noffer an expansive view of Russias approach to gain a strategic propaganda advantage or, if that \\nis not attainable, equal information security in the years ahead. Topics covered include \\ninformations impact on the initial period of war, the use of reflexive control, the ability to \\nmanipulate presidential elections (in 2004!), information templates, centers of gravity, the \\nmilitarys Intranet use, cyber troops, and Russias information infrastructure, among other \\nissues. There are many surprising developments to which others could be added. 2 Vladimir Ryzhkov, The Kremlins War Propaganda, 25 March 2014, at http://www.the moscowtimes.com/opinion/article/the-\\nkremlins-war-propaganda/496779.html\\n3 Ibid. Cyber/Influence Issues2 Consideration One: Have Media Tactics Changed over Time?2.1\\nHave Russian media tactics changed much since their intervention in Afghanistan in 1979? How \\ndo they compare to those used in Ukraine? Vladimir Ryzhkov, a Russian State Duma Deputy from 1993 to 2007 and now a political analyst, \\ndescribed in detail a conversation he had with a former KBG officers propaganda experience in \\nAfghanistan from the 1980s, in which the officer outlined the Soviet principles of an information \\ncampaign. The methods recalled by Ryzhkov from his KGB conversation are listed below,2 \\nfollowed in parentheses by an example of a similar method used by Russia in Ukraine: It is necessary to convince the general population that the government is acting correctly \\nand that the enemy is guilty of fomenting the crisis (Maidan protesters are to blame, the \\nnew government is linked to fascists, extremists, the US, and the West, which are the \\nreal aggressors). The Kremlin creates myths about the terrible persecutions of the Russian-speaking \\npopulation (the spin doctors created a virtual reality that appeared to find the right \\nbalance between truth and fiction, even though a human rights investigation by an \\nindependent European human rights agency found no violations or persecutions of the \\nRussian-speaking public in Crimea). The enemy must be demonized (Ukrainian Right Sector leader Dmitry Yarosh was used \\nfor this. Moreover, the moderate forces were presented as neo-Nazis, and negative \\nbackground information on Ukraines new leaders was brought to light). The authorities disguise their aggressive actions as humanitarian (Russia had a \\nhumanitarian need to protect defenseless Russians in Crimea from the events that \\ntranspired in Kiev). The Kremlin justifies its methods by citing alleged enemy actions (the US is trying to take \\nover Ukraine, so we must defend our ancestral territories). Authorities must be presented as legal and legitimate (Crimeans have a right to self-\\ndetermination). War propaganda depends on a totalitarian approach (domestically, Russia cracked down \\non TV Rain and Lenta.ru for airing opposition points of view and earlier had silenced the \\nmedia in Crimea once their forces intervened, pulling Black Sea TV, a local station that \\nsupported the new government in Kiev, off the air ).3 Numerous other uses of cyber and information activities also took place in Ukraine.

E. Kuleshov, B. B. Zhutdiev, and D. A. Fedorov, Information-Psychological Confrontation under Contemporary \\nConditions: Theory and Practice, Vestnik Akademii Voennykh Nauk (The Journal of the Academy of Military Science), No. 1 \\n2014, pp. 104-106.\\n8 Ibid., pp. 106-109. an attempt to interfere in the Ukrainian elections4 and there has been an extensive information-\\npsychological campaign on the battlefield via the manipulation of or warnings over the cell \\nphone use of Ukrainian soldiers.5 Consideration Two: Russian Templates for Influence2.2\\nAre there identifiable templates that Russia uses in their influence operations? Consideration one, above, offered one such template from the perspective of a KGB officer. \\nAnother was discussed in the book The Red Web, where authors Andrei Soldatov and Irina \\nBorogan developed a template through which to understand the Kremlins domestic approach \\nto media control. They noted that Parliament produces a flow of repressive legislation that \\nexploits cracks in previously published rules and regulations; hacktivists and trolls attack and \\nharass liberals online, posing as someone other than a Kremlin supporter; Roskomnadzor \\n[Russias Federal Service for the Supervision of Communications, Information Technology, and \\nMass Media] is granted the power to censor and filter the Internet; Kremlin-affiliated oligarchs \\nbankroll and take over media companies; specific manufacturers are selected to provide \\nsurveillance equipment; and Putins paranoia of enemies ties these actions together, resulting in \\nthreats and intimidation. Putins system is effective if people are certain the Kremlin is in \\ncontrol. This dynamic is transformed when a crisis occurs and a message must be shared in real \\ntime.6 In a 2014 article in the Journal of the Academy of Military Science, three authors from Belarus \\ndescribed a different type of template, offering an opinion on what they termed the ongoing \\ninformation-psychological confrontation. They believe the West was victorious in the \\ninformation-psychological war (an economic and information war) in the early 1990s. They \\ntermed this to be a new-generation war, since the confrontation rejected actual weapons. \\nThey state that information-psychological warfare has now become an acknowledged form of \\nmilitary art.7 This is an extremely important statement and one which Western analysts should \\nseriously consider as to its meaning and expression. The authors then discussed the goals, trends, and information measures of such confrontations. \\nFirst, they listed 13 ways to achieve the goals of information-psychological confrontation. \\nSecond, they listed five trends that will determine the nature of information-psychological \\nconfrontations in the next decade. Finally, when planning and implementing measures for \\ninformation-psychological confrontations, they listed five principles that should guide actions.8 \\nThe goals will be discussed further, along with trends. The authors note that the principal goals of an information-psychological confrontation are 9 Ibid., p. 106.\\n10 The MH-17 shootdown refers to the destruction of Malaysian airline flight 17, destroyed by a missile allegedly launched by \\nRussian troops in Eastern Ukraine; and the Sergey Skripal incident refers to the poisoning of a Russian defector to Great Britain, \\nwho was poisoned along with his daughter. regime change, an increase in the time to make decisions, and the means to control people. These \\ngoals are achieved via the following methods: changing the citizens moral values; creating a lack \\nof spirituality; destroying traditions and cultivating a negative attitude toward cultural legacy; \\nmanipulating the social consciousness; disorganizing systems and creating obstacles; \\ndestabilizing political relations; exacerbating political struggles and provoking repression; \\nreducing",
