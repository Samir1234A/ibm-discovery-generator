  "text": "more difficult to determine whose ability to \\noperationalize is in question. For example, one participating payer responded Access to electronic \\nmedical record (EMR) data and interoperability of systems as a top barrier. Interoperability of systems \\ncan represent a challenge to providers, payers, and potentially other stakeholders, and may require \\nsignificant multi-stakeholder collaboration and potentially regulatory guidance to chart a path forward. Identifying top facilitators provides insights for potential future strategies. The fact that payers selected \\npayer interest/readiness as the top facilitator to APM adoption speaks to the point that payers are \\nbroadly supportive of payment reform. The identification of purchaser interest/readiness as the \\nsecond top facilitator showcases the vital role purchasers play in promoting the use of APMs. Finally, \\nthere was a tie in the number of payers who identified provider interest/readiness and government \\ninfluence as top facilitators. Taken together, the identification of these top facilitators provides an \\nencouraging outlook to the future of APM adoption, as it appears that the four major stakeholder groups \\npayers, purchasers, providers, and the government all have potential to facilitate APM adoption.

PRS Case: 18-3770 14 Lessons Learned The LANs goal is to accelerate the adoption of APMs to create a healthcare system that results in higher \\nquality care that is both innovative and affordable. Tracking how quickly, or in what ways, the nations \\nhealthcare payments are changing is no easy task. While there is much more to uncover, over the last \\nthree years of measurement the LAN discovered many things. Value in Alignment First, there is clear value in alignment. The LAN developed standard definitions, frequently asked \\nquestions, and methodological approaches to help health plans classify and report data. Myriad \\nvariations in health plan programs means, however, that classifying payments into single categories \\n(when they almost never exist in isolation) is complex, and requires a high-touch, interactive approach to \\nensure the classifications are appropriate as data is collected. In addition, plans are frequently asked for \\nsimilar data from different entities, so the more the LAN proactively discusses and standardizes \\ndefinitions and data requests of health plans, the lower the burden for health plans to participate in \\nmeasurement efforts. Working to align with partners such as AHIP, BCBSA, and others in advance of the \\nmeasurement effort helped address these issues and minimize variation in interpretations and \\napproaches. Value in Benchmarking Health plans of all sizes are interested to learn where they stand in the movement toward APMs and \\nhow they compare to the market. Some health plan APM strategies are dictated by market conditions, \\nothers by factors such as data system limitations or provider readiness. Having conducted many \\ninteractions with individual health plans and states, a common theme that the LAN uncovered is that \\nplans are eager to analyze their own business using the APM Framework as a guide, and they find \\ninternal value from participating in a measurement effort. Individual data analysis assists health plans \\nand states with their own strategic planning based on the unique situations of their markets, which can \\nlead to innovations designed to improve care quality and affordability. Value in Customization Healthcare is local, and each market is unique, which means some health plans and states may take \\nmore aggressive approaches than others in the move toward APMs; other health plans and states may \\nfeel they have fewer opportunities to experiment. The LAN learned that direct comparisons between \\nhealth plans and across states or geographies are inappropriate because each plan and state deals with a \\nunique set of market dynamics related to supply and demand, urban and rural environments, provider or \\nplan readiness, and more. Still, there is value in understanding the facilitators and barriers to adoption of \\nAPMs in the different market segments. This years effort shows the differences in APM adoption even \\nmore acutely by line of business commercial, Medicaid, Medicare Advantage, and Medicare FFS \\nwhich can lead to greater insight into the similarities and differences in payment activity between them. Value in the Common Framework State Medicaid agencies from eight states use the LAN Framework to define the level and type of APMs \\nin their states Medicaid programs.21 State-level APM measurement is taking place in both the Medicaid Approved for Public Release.

States, specifically state regulators, are likely to have unique needs and desired \\noutcomes, and the LAN APM Framework provides a consistent foundation to measure state-specific \\nimplementation of APMs. The LAN looks forward to working with more states in future measurement \\nefforts and collaborating on how the APM Framework can help track state-specific APM adoption goals. Looking Forward The LAN APM Measurement Efforts demonstrate the significant progress health plans and states have \\nmade in moving to APMs as a means to improve quality and contain costs. The LAN encourages health plans, states, and other stakeholders to contribute to our national \\nunderstanding of APM adoption by collaborating in future LAN APM Measurement Efforts. It is through \\nthe collective efforts of the public and private sector that momentum continues to build around APM \\nadoption and experimentation to improve healthcare quality and affordability for all Americans.
