When two alert simultaneously, it took \\nslightly more time to discern who was blundering and who to talk to first.\\n(Tower / 28L/FMA) The ILS line lit was obvious, identifying the involved aircraft was less \\nso. --------------------------------- At the end of each Lateral Deviation scenario (QT6), controllers were asked if they had sufficient \\ntime and situational awareness to choose and execute appropriate corrective action once the \\nwarning (red) alert occurred in the scenario they just experienced. Their responses were \\nexamined with respect to monitor configuration and display type. Response Means and \\nStandard Deviations are summarized in Table 5-66. Scale responses are shown in Figure 5-78. \\nSome rows indicate n=9 and n=8 because not all Week 1 controllers experienced all scenarios \\n(see Section 4.5.6.6). Table 5-66. Controller Responses to Timeliness of Exceedance Warning Display Type STARS FMA\\nCombined 28L/28R Monitor Sample Size (n) 10 10 Mean (M) 69.9 81.8 Standard Deviation (SD) 23.0 18.0 28R Monitor\\nSample Size (n) 9 9 Mean (M) 86.6 85.6 Standard Deviation (SD) 16.4 18.5 28L Monitor\\nSample Size (n) 8 8 Mean (M) 88.6 89.8 Standard Deviation (SD) 12.9 9.9 ci\\n Figure 5-78. In this scenario, I felt I had sufficient time and situational awareness to choose and \\nexecute appropriate corrective action once the warning (red) alert occurred. Note: o indicates the Tower controller responses for reference. These are not included in the M and SD computations. Some rows \\nindicate n=9 and n=8 because not all Week 1 controllers experienced all of the Lateral Deviation scenarios. All (100%) TRACON controllers agreed they had sufficient time and situational awareness to \\nchoose and execute appropriate corrective action once the warning (red) alert occurred for \\nboth display types in the 28L position. A majority (89%) of TRACON controllers agreed for both \\ndisplay types in the 28R position. For the Combined Monitor configuration, a majority (70%) \\nagreed for the STARS display and a majority (90%) also agreed for the FMA display. Overall, no practical differences in exceedance warning timeliness were observed for all display \\ntype and monitor configurations, though the lower mean and higher response variability of the \\nCombined Monitor position with the STARS display may have been a more challenging condition \\nthan the others. Selected open-ended comments for this question included: (Tower / Combined/FMA) Not much time when the 28L guy blunders right. My \\nsituational awareness was ok, but no time to make appropriate transmissions & get \\nreadbacks. I see this problem being alleviated w/ split monitors.\\n(Non-NCT TRACON / 28L/STARS) I pre-planned with the other monitor in case of a \\nblunder situation into his final and I was able to see the a/c action and react properly, \\nalong with concurrent coordination.\\n(Non-NCT TRACON / 28R/STARS) STARS display of lateral bounds is too small to notice \\nany impending breach of boundary. 4:1 aspect ratio would improve this. Lateral Deviation Response Times6.6.5\\nAs noted in Section 4.5.7.2, the objective data that was collected included controller PTT times, aircraft state, and Lateral Boundary exceedance. This data was used in the \\nanalysis of the Lateral Deviation scenarios to examine whether controller monitor cii\\n configuration or display type had an effect on controller response time to an aircraft \\ncrossing a Lateral Boundary. The PTT data caveats described in Section 5.1.2 apply here. In sum, if the Local controller or \\npseudopilot was talking on the frequency, participants could not break in to override. \\nThey were, however, told to still click their handsets when they wanted to speak. The \\nfirst click that was recorded after an event of interest was used as a proxy for the \\ncontroller response time to resolve a situation. Though in the majority of cases clicks \\nwere observed shortly after a lateral deviation, there were three observed occasions of \\nlonger reaction times (i.e., 11-16 sec versus typically < 5 sec) after a Lateral Boundary \\ncrossing. Unfortunately, the limitations in the audio system make it impossible to \\nconclusively determine if these longer times reflected controller situation awareness or \\nfrequency congestion. As these instances could not conclusively be determined to be a \\nresult of this simulation limitation, they were not removed from the analysis data. A summary of the average Lateral Boundary crossing PTT response time data is shown in \\nTable 5-67. The response time was defined as the time between an aircraft crossing the \\nlateral boundary (triggering the Exceedance Warning) and the next PTT click. The data \\ncombines the two types of deviations (Type A Lead/Sharp versus Type B Trail/Shallow \\nsee Section 4.5.5.3). During data collection, some controllers were observed to have \\nintervened with deviating aircraft before they crossed the lateral boundary and triggered \\nthe Exceedance Warning. These cases were not included in the response time data in \\nTable 5-67, but are examined separately later in this section. These cases were the \\nprimary reason for the different n values; however, data collection issues also resulted \\nin some response times not being recorded for some scenarios. Table 5-67. Average Controller PTT Response Time (sec) After Lateral Boundary Crossings Display Type STARS FMA\\nCombined Monitor Sample Size (n) 14 13 Mean (M) 2.4 sec 3.1 sec Standard Deviation (SD) 1.2 5.5 Separate Monitors\\nSample Size (n) 14 12 Mean (M) 2.1 sec 2.3 sec Standard Deviation (SD) 1.3 3.0 The HITL data shows that on average, controllers responded (via a PTT click) to Lateral \\nBoundary crossings within approximately 2-3 seconds. Note this does not suggest \\ncontrollers first noticed the boundary crossing 2-3 seconds after it occurred; these values \\nonly represent the time between the Exceedance Warning display and the next PTT ciii\\n click of the participants handset. \\nTo examine whether monitor configuration or display type had an effect on Lateral Boundary crossing response times, a two-factor, repeated measures ANOVA test was \\nperformed. Due to the unbalanced sample sizes, the ANOVA was performed via a \\nregression analysis with the probability of finding an effect when there was none, alpha (\\n), set to 0.05. The results are shown in Table 5-68. Table 5-68. Controller PTT Response Time After Lateral Boundary Crossings: ANOVA Results SS df MS F p-value Significant?\\nMonitor Configuration 3.58 1 3.58 0.35 0.56 no Display Type 2.26 1 2.26 0.22 0.64 no\\nInteractions 1.24 1 1.24 0.12 0.73 no Within 506.10 49 10.33\\nTotal 513.13 52 9.87 The statistical analysis results from the simulation suggest controller response time to lateral \\ndeviations was not different as an effect of monitor configuration (p = 0.56) or display \\ntype (p = 0.64), nor were there any interaction effects (p = 0.73). --------------------------------- As noted earlier, some controllers were observed to have intervened with deviating aircraft \\nbefore they crossed the lateral boundary and triggered the Exceedance Warning. \\nControllers usually did not have enough time to watch a Type A (sharp) deviation \\ndevelop and the Exceedance Warning was often their first indication of the deviation. \\nHowever, controllers had more time to see a Type B (shallow) deviation developing. The \\nfrequency of interventions before the Exceedance Warning is shown in Table 5-69. In \\nthis case, the PTT response time was defined as the difference in time between when \\nthe aircraft first started its lateral deviation to the time of the next controller PTT click. \\nDue to the differences in time available to controllers to respond, the results are shown \\nseparately for Type A and Type B deviations. civ\\n Table 5-69. Average Controller PTT Response Time (sec) for Interventions Before Lateral Boundary \\nExceedance Warning Display Type / Deviation Type\\nType A (Sharp) Deviation\\nType B (Shallow) Deviation\\nSTARS FMA STARS FMA Combined Monitor\\nSample Size (n) 0 1 1 0 Mean (M) 4.0 sec 3.0 sec  Standard Deviation (SD) - - Separate Monitors\\nSample Size (n) 0 1 4 7 Mean (M) 5.0 sec 35.8 sec 28.3 sec Standard Deviation (SD) - 1.0 11.0 The small number of occurrences in which a controller intervened with a deviating aircraft \\nbefore the Exceedance Warning was displayed precludes a statistical analysis. However, \\nit is notable that the majority (11/14) of occurrences were with the Separate Controller \\nconfiguration with Type B (shallow) deviations. A closer examination of the underlying \\ndata showed that the majority (10/14) of these overall cases occurred with the same \\ntraffic file (O). In this traffic file, the shallow deviation of a Trail Aircraft began shortly \\nbefore the sharp deviation of the Lead Aircraft in a different pair. However, the \\nExceedance Warning of the (shallow) Trail occurred after the Exceedance Warning of the \\n(sharp) Lead. It seems likely that some controllers noticed the (shallow) deviating Trail \\nAircraft but waited to take",
