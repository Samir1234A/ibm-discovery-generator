  "text": "1(a) (145 band visible to shortwave infrared dataset with bad bands removed) if the data has higher intrinsic dimensionality [22]. However, codensity distributions from a small number of bands are generally not normal and care must be taken because non- normal behavior changes the intended mapping of z-score based methods. In these situations the cumulative density function (CDF) may be used instead of z-score providing a method to drive connections from kmax to 1 independent of the codensity functional form while maintaining the intended mapping. D. Adaptive Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Graphs The natural nearest neighbor (NNN) graph described by Zou and Zhu [23] provides a data-driven parameter-free method for the generation of node specific connectivity, 8. This \\nmethod was first applied to hyperspectral imagery by Ziemann et al. [24] while exploring target detection methods based on manifold approximations recovered from spectral data. The novel aspect of NNN is that there are no user defined parameters and the algorithm autonomously produces a node- specific connectivity proportional to local density. Natural nearest neighbors maintains a list of the number of times node has been identified as a neighbor by another \\nnode, , the reverse nearest neighbors of . This list of \\ncounts, 8, is built by sequentially examining the vector of rth \\nnearest neighbors for every pixel where E = 1, , 8=@A. For \\nexample, the first iteration adds edges between each node and its first nearest neighbor. 8 is incremented anytime pixel i \\nappears as pixel js rth neighbor. This process continues until every pixel has been declared a neighbor by another pixel. Naturally, nodes located in regions of high spectral density appear as neighbors of other nodes more often than those in low density regions so their connectivity counts, 8, will be \\nhigher. Once the stopping criterion has been met, the algorithm connects each node to its 8 neighbors given by F, \\nwhere each pixel is guaranteed to be a member of a connected component of at least two pixels by the termination criterion. As a result, pixels with high 8 counts will be highly \\nconnected and pixels with low 8 counts will be weakly \\nconnected, corresponding to high and low density regions respectively. Like k-NN, this method generally produces unconnected graphs so post processing methods to ensure connectivity must be employed for analytical techniques requiring connected graphs. As intuitively appealing as the NNN construction may be, it does suffer from a pathological case that can produce prohibitively long execution times and much less useful graphs. Assume there is one node in the data far away from every other node. Given NNN iterates until each node has been declared a neighbor by another node, and the isolated node is \\n(=0.005). In no instance did the test report normality under these loose conditions. Most codensity distributions were unimodal with a positive skew. However, z-score use under unimodal conditions is still a reasonable approximation. (a) (b) Fig. 1. Marked up unimodal codensity distribution. The right hand axis shows the number of node-specific connections for a 30-NN graph (k=30, six z-score regions, kmin=1, kmax=5).

Case Number 16-3868 \\n 5 so far away, it will take G 1 iterations until termination, \\nproducing a complete graph. This sensitivity to noise and anomalous pixels led Ziemann et al. [7] to add another stopping criterion. Iteration is terminated if the node specific connectivity list 8 , is \\nunchanged after examining the rth nearest neighbor. The algorithm as described in [7] is provided below where GGF is the rth nearest neighbor of pixel i, F is the set of \\nr neighbors of the ith pixel, and J'E is the number of nodes \\nthat have yet to be declared a neighbor by another node, i.e., those with 8 = 0. 1) Initialize \\nE = 1, 8 = 0, GG' = , ' = , G = ||, J'0 = 0 2) Find nearest neighbors , calculate the ELM nearest neighbor, GGF, and set \\n F = FN& {GGF}. 3) Identify reverse nearest neighbor counts , count the number of times i occurs in F, =\\n1, , G and set 8 = RSTGU. \\na. if J'E J'E 1 continue to 3b else end \\nb. If such that 8 = 0 then increment r and return to step 2 else proceed to step 4. 4) Build graph Connect to its 8 nearest neighbors The additional stopping criterion (3a.) helps deter prohibitively long run times. However, changing a single node at each iteration could still produce long execution times, but this has not been observed in practice. Ziemanns variant is called the adaptive nearest neighbor (ANN) graph and is the starting point for many adaptive methods to follow. ANN may still produce isolated pixels and additional post processing may be required to ensure graph connectivity for some types of analyses. E. Edge Reweighting Methods The graph construction methods described in Sections II-A- D all create a graph, = ,., wherein edge weights, ) , \\nare encoded by the metric used to determine distance (or similarity) to each node. These metrics are called primary metrics as they are used to determine initial edges of the graph. One may also change the edge weights based on some function or heuristic to reinforce particular properties of the primary metric space. In this study, we focus on changing edge weights (called edge reweighting) based on a measure of local spectral density, producing spectral-density weighted secondary metrics. Reweighting do not change the structure of the graph, only the weights assigned to the edges, so in essence they are not graph construction techniques per se, but are addressed as such for continuity of the discussion. Note some reweighting schemes we will encounter can sever edges by setting ) = 0, \\nso they could be considered construction methods in their own right (Sections II-F and III-A). The non-iterative contextual dissimilarity measure (NICDM) introduced by Jegou et al. [37] rescales distances based on measures of each nodes local scale as shown in (2). This method has not been used on HSI data, but provides a nice introduction for multiple methods to come. ji ji jiij vvd\\nvvNICDMw \\n),( ),( == (2) The spectral Euclidean distance, , , is rescaled by the \\ngeometric mean of the local scaling parameters for each pixel, a and b . Jegou defines the local scaling as the distance to the \\nkth nearest neighbor, but we offer any of the codensity measurements described in Section II-C as viable local scale (a) (b) (c) Fig. 2.

Pixels i and j are therefore only similar if the spectral Euclidean distance between them is small relative each pixels local spectral scale3. Zelnik-Manor and Perona (ZMP) [27] introduce a locally adaptive scaling that transforms primary distance metrics into scaled affinities by taking the exponential of the negative squared NICDM as shown in (3), i.e., a radial basis function (also called a diffusion kernel) in spectral distance with parameters b and b . \\n \\n \\n== ji ji jiij vvd\\nvvZMPw 2),(\\nexp),( (3) Parameters are defined as per (2), but the negative exponential results in a rescaled space wherein the new similarity, 0 0,1. Zelnik-Manor also used the distance to \\nthe kth nearest neighbor, but again any scale determination method of Section II-C is possible. This method is also known as non-local means in the image processing literature if the sum of the weights for each pixel is normalized to one [40]. We model an example after that of Schnitzer et al. [28] to demonstrate the effectiveness of locally adaptive scaling. Fig. 2(a) displays a simple 2D grid consisting of two clusters of differing density; one existing within the other. A Delaunay triangulation is used to define edges between the vertices, with edge weights initially set to the Euclidean distance between the vertices. Note that a Delaunay triangulation is used to emphasize weight rescaling vice potential differences due to graph construction techniques (missing edges). Fig. 2(b) shows edges weighted by similarity, i.e., the shorter the distance, the more similar the nodes and the thicker the edge. Notice nodes in the less dense outer cluster (background) appear as dissimilar despite being quite similar (same average distances and density) to their surroundings. The thickest edges (shortest distances) are in the dense center cluster. Fig. 2(c) shows the resultant edge weights after the application of ZMP locally adaptive scaling. Notice the stronger relationship between pixels within each cluster and the weaker",
