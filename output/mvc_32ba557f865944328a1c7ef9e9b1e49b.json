Flipping the Odds for Successful Reorganization. \\nThe Boston Consulting Group, April 2012. During times of transition, leaders commonly look for ways to better deliver on an agencys mission. \\nOften, a new leaders first instinct is to look critically at the organizations structure, believing that \\nmoving organizational boxes and lines will improve results. However, changing an organizations \\nstructure will not necessarily resolve organizational performance issues, particularly given the high rate \\nof reorganization failure.1 New leaders can more effectively achieve sought-after results by considering \\nthe broader system of organizational elements that impact performance. of the current organizational environment, both internal \\nand external. By conducting a baseline organizational \\nassessment leaders can better diagnose areas for needed \\nimprovement and perhaps completely avoid the need for \\na redesign. Before Moving Boxes: Understand the Current \\nState of the Organization The Burke-Litwin Model (Figure 1) provides a proven \\nframework to help organizations understand the By rushing the decision to restructure or restructuring \\nwithout clear evidence that the structure is the problem, \\nan organization risks lowering employee engagement, \\nlosing mission critical skills, and interrupting essential ser-\\nvice delivery. Moreover, an organization that restructures \\nbefore assessing the myriad interrelated factors impacting \\nperformance can obscure genuine, root cause problems \\nand quickly generate new ones. Before undertaking an organizational restructuring effort, \\nit is critical for new leaders to have a clear understanding Figure 1. Burke-Litwin Causal Model of Organizational Performance and Change Leadership Motivation Work Unit Climate Management Practices External \\nEnvironment Individual and\\nOrganizational\\nPerformance Individual Needs and \\nValuesTask and Individual Structure Mission and Strategy Systems (Policies and \\nProcedures) Organizational Culture Boxes in the model indicate primary variables affecting organizational performance Higher level variables (in blue) have greater weight in affecting organizational change organizational and environmental variables that impact \\nperformance and how these variables link to each other.3 The model allows leaders to take a systematic approach \\nto evaluating the organization and managing the complex \\nnature of change. The boxes in the model represent key \\nvariables affecting organizational performance. Arrows \\nindicate critical linkages between the variables. A change \\nin any variable will ultimately affect every other variable. \\nIdeally, an organization should strive to appropriately align \\nthese variables to enhance organizational performance. Higher-level variablesMission and Strategy, Leadership \\nand Organizational Cultureare considered transforma-\\ntional. External environmental forces most directly affect \\nthese variables, and improving these transformational \\nvariables usually requires new behavior from organizational \\nmembers. The lower, more operational and transactional \\nvariables can be impacted by relatively short-term adjust-\\nments in the workforce. Together, these transformational \\nand transactional factors affect motivation, which, in turn, \\naffects performance. Higher-level variables have greater \\nweight in affecting organizational change. An organizational assessment using this model, conducted \\nthrough a series of targeted interviews and focus groups \\nwith internal and external stakeholders, provides leaders \\nwith qualitative data regarding each of these causal \\nfactors. By taking a more holistic view of the organization If an organizational restructuring is warranted after all If the results of an organizational assessment indicate \\nthat restructuring will best help the organization deliver \\non its mission, leaders should keep in mind the following \\ncritical factors for successful redesign efforts: Obtain leadership commitment at each level of the\\norganization impacted by the change; Ensure alignment of the organizations strategy with\\nthe new organization design; Actively engage stakeholders impacted by the\\ntransformation throughout the effort; Uphold transparency and objectivity in the redesign\\nand implementation process; Allocate the necessary time and resources to\\nimplement the new organization design; and Develop transition plans for the new organization\\nstructure which accommodate and address varying\\nlevels of change readiness. across all these variables, leaders can then identify the \\nappropriate organizational factors to address to enhance \\nperformance. After the Assessment: Alternatives to \\nOrganizational Restructuring Assessment data often reveal that an organizations \\nstructure is sound and other factors are the cause of poor \\nperformance. For example, if an assessment reveals a \\nnew or pressing organizational demand is causing internal \\nstress, a leader can construct temporary structures or \\nteams to address the issue while keeping the formal struc-\\nture constant. Likewise, by looking across a set of primary \\ntransactional variables of the model (Structure, Manage-\\nment Practices and Systems), a leader may determine \\nthat while the structure is sound, the true issue resides in \\nintegrating mechanisms used by the organization. Inte-\\ngrating mechanisms are the informal linkages that support \\ncoordination and communication across the structural \\nboundaries of an organizationthe wiring between the \\nboxes on the organization chart and the networks at the \\nheart of the organization. A comprehensive organizational assessment provides \\nleaders insight into the myriad factors impacting the orga-\\nnizations performance. With this data, leaders can better \\ntarget the true cause of an organizations performance \\ndeficiencies and develop corrective actions to address \\nthose areas moving forward.
