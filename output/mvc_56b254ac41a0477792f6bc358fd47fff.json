  "text": "Initiation Task6.9.2.1\\nIn the 28R Final controller position, all or a majority of TRACON controller participants agreed \\non average that: Workload was low and acceptable. (Section 5.3.1)\\nFinal controllers can acceptably initiate the IM PA operation. (Section 5.3.2 and Section \\n5.8.7)\\nOnce the IM Trail Aircraft joined the final, they had sufficient time and airspace to \\ninitiate IM PA before transferring the aircraft to the Local controller. (Section 5.3.2)\\nThey had the necessary display elements to provide the appropriate IM Clearance \\ninformation to the Trail Aircraft in an IM PA pair. (Section 5.3.2)\\nIt is operationally acceptable for the Final controller to provide the IM PA spacing goal. \\n(Section 5.3.3)\\nThe IM PA spacing goal communication was acceptable. (Section 5.3.3)\\nThey were comfortable with the use of the Lead Aircraft call sign in the IM Clearance \\ncommunication. (Section 5.3.3) As described in Section 5.5.6.2, on average, the TRACON participants recommended the \\nfollowing tools to always be on to help the Final controller complete the IM Clearance: cxix\\n CSL Line\\nPredictive Alert and Caution Alert\\nIM PA Spacing Goal\\nLead Aircraft Call Sign\\nLead Aircraft Runway On average, the TRACON participants recommended the following tools either always be on or \\nuser toggleable to help the Final controller complete the IM Clearance: WSL-P\\nTrail Aircraft Status\\nIM Status\\nInner and Outer Lateral Boundaries 28R Final IM PA Monitoring Task6.9.2.2\\nIn the 28R Final controller position, all or a majority of TRACON controller participants agreed \\non average that: They were comfortable with the IM Trail Aircraft managing their speeds to achieve the \\nspacing goal while in their area. (Section 5.3.4)\\nGiven the appropriate training and tools, Final controllers can acceptably ensure \\nseparation during IM PA operations before transferring aircraft to the Local controller. \\n(Section 5.3.5)\\nThey were comfortable that they were transferring appropriately separated aircraft to \\nthe Local controller. (Section 5.3.5) Monitor Configurations6.9.3\\nOn average, across both monitor configurations, all or a majority of TRACON controller \\nparticipants agreed: Overall workload was low (Section 5.5.1.1) and acceptable. (Section 5.4.1)\\nRoles and responsibilities were clear with respect to all aircraft in the simulation. \\n(Section 5.4.2)\\nThey were able to detect in a sufficient amount of time when spacing / separation issues \\nwere developing within IM PA and other aircraft pairs. (Section 5.4.3)\\nGiven the appropriate training and IM PA-related tools, IM PA operations can be \\neffectively monitored by either configuration. (Section 5.4.4) \\nGiven the appropriate training and IM PA-related tools, a single (Combined) Monitor \\ncontroller can effectively ensure separation across both approaches during IM PA \\noperations. (Section 5.4.4)\\nThey were comfortable monitoring one aircraft in an IM PA pair, while another controller \\nmonitored the other aircraft. (Section 5.4.4) cxx\\n They would expect to be able to effectively monitor any number of IM PA pairs, up to \\nand including all aircraft pairs performing IM PA. (Section 5.4.4) Lateral Deviation Monitoring6.9.4\\nWith respect to the Lateral Deviation scenarios, all or a majority of TRACON controller \\nparticipants, on average, agreed: Their workload was acceptable across all display types and monitor configurations. \\n(Section 5.6.1)\\nThey were confident they could assess whether separation would be maintained \\nbetween the IM Trail Aircraft and their Lead aircraft. (Section 5.6.2)\\nThey could easily assess whether aircraft involved in an IM PA operation were operating \\nwithin their Lateral Boundaries. (Section 5.6.3). Controllers appeared to find the FMA \\ndisplay (versus STARS) aided in their Lateral Boundary assessment. (Section 5.8.5)\\nAdvance notice of an impending exceedance of the Lateral Boundaries would have been \\nmore helpful than essential. (Section 5.6.4 and Section 5.8.5)\\nThe lateral Exceedance Warning was noticeable enough such that they became aware of \\nit without undue delay. (Section 5.6.4)\\nThey had sufficient time and situational awareness to choose and execute appropriate \\ncorrective action once the Exceedance Warning occurred. (Section 5.6.4)\\nControllers responded (via a PTT click) to Lateral Boundary crossings within \\napproximately 2-3 seconds, which did not appear to be affected by monitor \\nconfiguration or display type. (Section 5.6.5) IM PA Tools6.9.5 General Effects6.9.5.1\\nOn average, a majority of TRACON controller participants did not agree: The Monitor controller should be provided an IM Spacing List. (Section 5.5.5)\\nOn average for the Day 1-2 Nominal scenarios, TRACON controller responses suggested there was no apparent difference between IM PA Tool configurations (On versus Off) \\nwith respect to:\\nWorkload level and acceptability. (Section 5.5.1.1)\\nTraffic awareness. (Section 5.5.1.2)\\nHaving sufficient time to make a first assessment of separation as the IM PA pairs \\nbecame their responsibility. (Section 5.5.2)\\nComfort in monitoring IM PA operations when both a CSL and WSL were active at the \\nsame time. (Section 5.2.2 and Section 5.8.1)\\nAbility of a single (Combined) Monitor controller to effectively ensure separation across \\nboth approaches during IM PA operations. (Section 5.4.4) cxxi\\n Comfort in monitoring one aircraft while another controller monitored the other. \\n(Section 5.4.4)\\nTimely detection of any impending exceedance of the WSL or CSL. (Section 5.5.4.2)\\nTimely detection of any spacing or separation issues. (Section 5.5.4.2)\\n28R Final controller Workload (Section 5.3.1) and IM PA initiation tasks. (Section 5.3.2) On average for the Day 1-2 Nominal scenarios, TRACON controller responses suggested \\nthere may have been a difference between IM PA Tool configurations (On versus Off) \\nwith respect to:\\nIM Speed Control. As described in Section 5.5.1.3, the increased variability for the IM PA \\nTools Off configuration suggests that at least for the Combined Monitor position, having \\nthe IM PA Tools available may increase controller comfort with IM Trail Aircraft \\nmanaging their own speeds.\\nSeparation assessment between the IM Trail Aircraft and its Lead. As described in \\nSection 5.5.2, the increased variability for the IM PA Tools Off configuration suggests \\nthat at least for the Combined Monitor position, having the IM PA Tools available may \\nhelp controllers more easily assess the separation between the IM Trail Aircraft and its \\nLead.\\n28R Final controller ensuring appropriately separated aircraft at handoff to the Local \\ncontroller. As described in Section 5.3.5, controller responses were variable, though \\nresponse variability was lower with IM PA Tools Off. It is unclear why.\\nBeing able to easily tell when an aircraft would require a WSL later in the approach. As \\ndescribed in Section 5.5.3.2, for the Separate 28R Monitor configuration position, a \\nmajority (57%) of Week 2-3 TRACON controllers agreed they could easily tell with the IM \\nPA Tools On. With IM PA Tools Off, a majority (71%) of controllers disagreed. This \\ndifference was not observed for the Combined Monitor configuration. Safety Limit Depictions and WSL Pre-Active Notification Features6.9.5.2\\nOn average, all or a majority of TRACON controller participants agreed: The CSL Line was useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task. (Section 5.5.3.1)\\nThey could easily assess whether the IM Trail Aircraft would remain behind the CSL \\nduring the approach. (Section 5.5.3.1)\\nThe WSL Line was useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task. (Section 5.5.3.2)\\nThey could easily assess whether the IM Trail Aircraft would remain forward of the WSL. \\n(Section 5.5.3.2)\\nIt was helpful to know whether an aircraft would eventually require an active WSL. \\n(Section 5.5.3.2)\\nThe WSL-P was useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task. (Section 5.5.3.2)\\nIf provided the WSL-P, the WSL W indicator in the data block is not also needed. \\n(Section 5.5.3.2) cxxii\\n The WSL-P was more useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task than the WSL Pre-\\nActive Indication (W) feature in the data block. (Section 5.8.3)\\nThe WSL-P first appeared with sufficient lead time to be useful. (Section 5.5.3.2)\\nA WSL-P should become available sooner than the 7 NM implemented in the simulation. \\n(Section 5.5.3.2) On average, all or a majority of TRACON controller participants did not agree that: The Data Block Distance to the CSL was useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task. \\n(Section 5.5.3.1)\\nThe Data Block Distance to the WSL was useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task. \\n(Section 5.5.3.2)\\nThe WSL Pre-Active Indication W feature was useful for the overall IM PA monitoring \\ntask. (Section 5.5.3.2)\\nIf provided the initial WSL W indicator in the data block, the WSL-P is not needed. \\n(Section 5.5.3.2) Longitudinal Alerting6.9.5.3\\nOn average, all or a majority of TRACON controller participants agreed: They want to be able to see a situation developing versus only being provided an alert \\nwhen they had to take action. (Section 5.5.4.1)\\nThe IM PA Predictive Alert and IM PA Caution Alert features were useful for the overall \\nIM PA monitoring task. (Section 5.5.4.1)\\nControllers felt more strongly that the IM PA Caution Alert was useful for the overall IM \\nPA monitoring task than the IM PA Predictive Alert. (Section 5.8.4)\\nThe IM PA-related tools allowed for a timely detection of any impending exceedance of \\nthe WSL or CSL. (Section 5.5.4.2)\\nThe IM PA-related tools allowed for a timely detection of any spacing or separation \\nissues. (Section 5.5.4.2)\\nIt was helpful to indicate the Predictive Alert and Caution Alert via the data block line 3 \\ncolor change. (Section 5.5.4.4)\\nIt was helpful to indicate the Predictive Alert and Caution Alert via the CSL or WSL line \\ncolor change. (Section 5.5.4.4) \\nTheir responsibilities with respect to a Predictive Alert and Caution Alert were clear. \\n(Section 5.5.4.5) When different alert timing values were tested: \\nThe majority of Week 2-3 TRACON controllers agreed the Predictive (yellow) alert \\nprovided sufficient advance notice of an impending Caution Alert at any of the tested \\nalert timing values. (Section 5.5.4.2) \\nThe majority of Week 2-3 TRACON",
