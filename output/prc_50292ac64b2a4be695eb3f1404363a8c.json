Public Release Case Number 18-2212 Online Web Access and Data Base Tool Options \\nThe team working at MITRE used Sharepoint as an initial prototyping tool for this study because it is being widely used for this type of purpose at MITRE and other commercial Corporations and it is already on the Navys NMCI enterprise environment and available to every user at NAVSEA. Other options for implementing this type of data base functionality are platforms like Infusion/Confluence/Jira or MySQL or Web Logic. These tools are being investigated. There are several factors that are involved in creating data base tools for an enterprise, primarily functionality, size and scalability, simultaneous access, and security. For the immediate near term use the Microsoft Sharepoint platform provides the required functionality (data type enforcement on entry, logic testing when creating views, access to the Navys Outlook email directory services and automated email). Whether the software needs to support a large number of projects (e.g. several PEOs) or a small number (e.g. only pilot program use) is an important consideration. For eventual enterprise level use, Sharepoint may have size limitations however, as the file is essentially a large flat-file structure. Creating subfolders for each PEO would solve the size limitation, while still allowing the creation of integrated reports at the enterprise level. Connectivity to a SQL data base would also solve the size limitation issues, and allow improved security and replication (data durability). The Confluence/Jira tools may require more extensive operator efforts to create this type of online repository, and are designed to create online documents, not collect data online. Sharepoint Lists are designed to collect data online, but in small quantities. These types of environments have both had reported security issues when the data bases were not locked down properly. For some of the acquisition documents, such as the Acquisition Plan, we leveraged a standard template and appendix, and focused on adapting the appendix into a data base. In the future it may also be possible to leverage this approach for other documents, providing greater efficiency. Other documents, such as the TEMP and LCSP, were already more data focused and were easily adapted. The draft schema provided in this report can evolve through testing in the pilot program.

Public Release Case Number 18-2212 An Expert Assistant for Project Planning and Reviews \\nThe shift towards data driven project management tools should also allow project managers the ability to do improved project planning. This can be done three ways: a) The project initiation tool can provide helpful guidance in the instruction on how to structure certain milestones, based on the new structures being put into place to support the data-based acquisition process. b) The project initiation tool can provide an ongoing running average of schedule durations for certain steps, such as data-based project AP approvals, so that a project engineer or manager can see how long certain actions are currently taking and allow a similar time span. (the executive oversight steering Team will also have access to these metrics to monitor progress, set goals, and attempt corrective actions to speed schedule activity). This would require that the planning tool be designed to allow a split screen viewing that allowed the input of new data on the left side of the screen, and display of similar to columns for other projects on the right side of the screen. c) Once several projects have started and are being executed, the project initiation tool could allow project engineers and managers to select projects from the data base that are similar to their project, and see how long actions are taking. This might work a lot like the comparison shopping tool on Amazon.com where you can compare the features of several items before deciding on a purchase. The tool could also ask several questions about the project or observe the parameters that are input first, then provide recommendations as to planning actions and schedules based on the data base of previous project. This also suggests that Program Executives and Program Managers could take advantage of such an expert when they are reviewing projects, either during review meetings or in a background manner. The tool could allow them to compare the project to others in a similar manner as the planning module, and compare execution schedules and success. The data base could also be set up to provide email alerts when an ongoing project and an execution parameter passes a certain threshold or misses a critical milestone in a manner that predicts future problems. Such an expert system will help prevent projects from starting out with poorly planned schedules. Many projects miss schedules or have execution issues because their schedule was designed by matching an almost randomly generated budget profile, dictated by a political decision, generated by a contractors marketing presentation, or guessed by a project team struggling to finish a myriad of other tasks and without any sort of data for comparison. The expert system can also provide useful inputs to new teams that are used to the old schedules that took forever, providing useful suggestions and recommended event metrics based on the new approaches being used.

Public Release Case Number 18-2212 Summary / Recommendations \\nAs part of an improved defense business model, Acquisition Strategies, Acquisition Plans, Test and Evaluation Master Plans, Life Cycle Sustainment Plans, Cyber Security Strategy Plans, and the Acquisition Planning Baseline and Decision Memorandum can all be converted to use a data- based management approach. This will allow automated routing of the projects data for approvals, and also captures project data in its elemental form, thus allowing the application of data analytics to support strategic reviews by NAVSEA management. This approach can also be expanded relatively easily to allow data to be captured and re-used for the Requests for Proposals (e.g. product names, reference specifications or drawing numbers, quantities required, period of performance, etc). This approach may not always work for every procurement or major platforms, but could allow rapid actions for a large number of projects. The draft schema provided in this report can evolve through testing in the pilot program. Shifting to a data-based approach to procurement planning and project management at NAVSEA should allow data-based projects to move faster and provide project and management data to senior leadership that will allow metric based decisions and pilot tools that could be used in a larger number of Navy programs. MITRE Recommends that the project data base functionality be tested on several platforms (e.g. Sharepoint and Confluence/Jira), if possible, and assessed for usability and functionality. The technical features of the hosting environments can be assessed and measured or rated, and then a final decision can be",
