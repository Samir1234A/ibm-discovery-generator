  "text": "approach paths and to quickly detect \\ndeviations. Figure 4-19. Predictive Alert Depiction on the 4:1 FMA Display Relative to the CSL Lateral Boundaries and Exceedance Warning5.2.8\\nThe lateral monitoring task and associated procedures and requirements for IM PA operations \\nare still in the early stages of development. As described in Section 2.4.2, Mendolia, et al. (2016) \\nexamined a lateral deviation monitoring task with a custom-designed NNZ, based on an NTZ, \\nand associated caution and warnings. Its purpose was to assist aircraft in avoiding wake \\nencounters as it assumed that collision protection was afforded by keeping aircraft aft of the \\nCSL. The lateral monitoring task, however, evolved for the current HITL due to the new IM PA \\nrequirement that controllers are responsible for separation and therefore must be able to xv\\n monitor the operation relative to a clear separation standard. As described in Section 4.2.1, the \\nPA separation standard for the HITL was defined by the CSL and WSL. It was thus assumed that \\ncontrollers needed to know how much lateral deviation was permitted before the limits were \\nno longer valid. If either aircraft then deviated beyond those values in either direction (left or \\nright), PA separation would no longer apply and another form of separation would be required. \\nThe lateral monitoring task was therefore different from that in Mendolia, et al. (2016) and the \\nNNZ and alerting design needed to be reconsidered to help controllers determine whether \\nobserved lateral flight path deviations were within the allowable normal variability, or whether \\nthey were large enough to render the CSL and WSL invalid. This section describes the design assumptions behind the Lateral Boundaries and Exceedance \\nWarning as implemented. Procedures suggested to the controller participants for managing \\naircraft deviations across any of these boundaries are described in Section 4.3. The Lateral \\nBoundaries and procedures are notional constructs developed specifically for the HITL \\nsimulation. Procedures and tools for managing IM PA operations across the range of possible \\nlateral deviation geometries require further development. Lateral Boundary Configurations5.2.8.1\\nDue to the revised lateral monitoring task, an inner and outer boundary is required for each \\napproach path. To inform this work, the HITL examined two Lateral Boundary configurations \\nbased on the navigation error assumed in deriving the CSL (Williams & Wood, 2017): A configuration based on the most constraining Total System Error (TSE) accommodation 1.\\nfor current NTZ implementations for independent runway operations. This consists of a \\n500 ft distance from the approach path to each boundary, for both approaches. This was \\nthe default condition and used during the Nominal (Section 4.5.5.1) and Alert Timing \\nscenarios (Section 4.5.5.2). A configuration that assumes the 500 ft TSE for 28R (as with Configuration #1), and three 2.\\ntimes the standard deviation of TSE assumed by Volpe in the wake research for the ILS \\n28L approach (unpublished). This configuration was examined only during the Lateral \\nDeviation scenarios (Section 4.5.5.3). The boundaries for both configurations extended from the start of the approach (15 NM final) \\nto approximately 2 NM from the runway threshold. Inside of 2 NM, a deviation allowance of 75 \\nft was assumed. As boundaries at that distance are not realistically distinguishable from the \\napproach path centerlines on the radar display, no attempt was made to display them. \\nTherefore, from 2 NM to the runway, the controller task was to monitor deviations by ensuring \\nthe center of the target symbol remained on the approach path centerline. Unlike the NNZ \\ndescribed in Mendolia, et al. (2016), the Lateral Boundaries could not be toggled on or off or \\nchanged in brightness. For the Lateral Deviation scenarios, this lateral monitoring task was \\nevaluated against both the standard 1:1 STARS display and a 4:1 FMA display. Both operated in \\na simulated FUSION mode with a one-second surveillance update rate. Configuration #1, with 500 ft for both runways, was used for all HITL scenarios except for some \\nDay 3 Lateral Deviation cases. A scaled depiction of the lateral boundaries for this configuration \\nis illustrated in Figure 4-20. xvi\\n Figure 4-20. Scaled Depiction of Lateral Boundaries for Configuration #1 xvii\\n Figure 4-21 shows a scaled representation of the Lateral Boundaries in TARGETS with the \\nelements labeled. Figure 4-22 contains scaled depictions of the Lateral Boundaries for \\nConfiguration #1 as implemented in the simulation. Figure 4-21. TARGETS Depiction of Configuration #1 Figure 4-22. Configuration #1 on Standard STARS Display Configuration #2 (500 ft for 28R and ILS for 28L) was examined in some of the Day 3 Lateral \\nDeviation scenarios. A scaled depiction of the lateral boundaries for this configuration is \\nillustrated in Figure 4-23. xviii\\n Figure 4-23. Scaled Depiction of Lateral Boundaries for Configuration #2 xix\\n Figure 4-24 shows Configuration #2 on the standard STARS display. Figure 4-25 shows how \\nConfiguration #2 appeared on the 4:1 FMA display. Figure 4-24. Configuration #2 on Standard STARS Display Figure 4-25. Configuration #2 on the 4:1 FMA Display Lateral Boundary Exceedance Warning5.2.8.2\\nUnder nominal conditions, the Lateral Boundary outlines were depicted in white on the display. \\nWhen an aircraft crossed either of its respective boundary lines, an Exceedance Warning was \\npresented to the controller. This consisted of two elements: 1) the inboard or outboard \\nboundary line that was crossed turned red, then 2) a lateral LAT indication was displayed in \\nthe deviating aircrafts data block line 0, similar to the zone alert text string indications in \\nMendolia, et al. (2016). Unlike in the prior study, it did not flash while active nor did the entire \\ndata block change color on the FMA display to indicate the alert. When a lateral deviation occurred, the IM PA operation automatically terminated and the \\nrelated IM PA display features (other than the Lateral Boundaries) were removed. The Lateral \\nBoundary line remained red until the deviating aircraft was greater than 3000 ft past it. The line \\nthen returned to its former white color. Arrival aircraft not involved in IM PA operations would \\nnot trigger the Exceedance Warning. Figure 4-26 illustrates an Exceedance Warning for United \\n(UAL) 748 crossing the inboard Lateral Boundary. The 28L Inboard Boundary is red, and a red \\nLAT is displayed in Line 0 of its data block. xx\\n Figure 4-26. Exceedance Warning for UAL748 Crossing Inboard Lateral Boundary Controllers could use existing STARS tools such as the PTLs and ground track bats to help detect \\nlateral deviations on both the STARS and FMA displays. Figure 4-27 shows how PTLs appeared \\nagainst the lateral boundary on Configuration #2 (500 ft for 28R and ILS for 28L) on the FMA \\ndisplay. In this scenario, UAL12 has just begun an outboard deviation but has not yet crossed \\nthe boundary. Figure 4-27. PTLs on Configuration #2 on the FMA Display Figure 4-28 shows ground track bats on Configuration #2 (500 ft for 28R and ILS for 28L) on the \\n4:1 FMA display. Figure 4-28. Heading Bats on Configuration #2 on the FMA Display xxi\\n Figure 4-29 and Figure 4-30 show a lateral inboard deviation by an IM Lead Aircraft, UAL748, on \\nthe 4:1 FMA display when ground track bats were active. In the former, UAL748 started the \\ndeviation but has not yet crossed the boundary. In the latter, UAL748 has crossed the boundary, \\ntriggered the Exceedance Warning, and had its IM PA display information automatically \\nremoved. Figure 4-29. Start of UAL748 Deviation, Before Crossing the Inboard Lateral Boundary Figure 4-30. UAL748 Crossing the Inboard Lateral Boundary As with the zone warnings described in in Mendolia, et al. (2016), the Exceedance warning only \\nappeared when an aircraft crossed one of the boundaries. There was no Predictive Alert \\ncapability for lateral deviations. Unlike the three different zone warnings shown in Figure 2-12, \\nthe current study design only involved a single Exceedance Warning for the entire length of the \\napproach. This was because of the changes to the monitoring task as described in the beginning \\nof Section 4.2.8. Scenarios5.3\\nThis section provides an overview of the simulation scenarios, including the setup assumptions, \\nairspace, and traffic flows. IM PA Setup and Simulated Airspace5.3.1\\nEach traffic scenario consisted of streams of arrival aircraft to SFO 28L and 28R parallel runways \\n(see Figure 2-8). The flows contained a mix of aircraft separated via the PA and Single Runway xxii\\n Spacing (SRS) standards. Wake turbulence RECAT separation standards (FAA, 2016) were \\napplied and are discussed in more detail in Section 4.3.3. Based on current airspace and RNAV procedures at SFO, a significant amount of vectoring would \\nbe needed to support the IM PA operation being evaluated in this HITL simulation. Aircraft \\nlanding on 28L generally approach the final approach course from the south, following vectoring \\nfrom Boulder. These final sectors reach only to 5000 ft mean sea level. Most aircraft operating \\ninto SFO will be above that altitude and therefore under the control of an overlying sector when \\nthey enter the lateral extent of the sector. It is typically not until the aircraft nears the final \\napproach course that they descend into Final controller airspace. However, the simulation was not scoped to examine IM PA setup in feeder airspace. The initial \\npositioning of the aircraft in the",
