  "text": "weapons of influence. In an eerie reference to problems associated with the 2016 US \\nPresidential election and the elections in Europe, the article twice referenced influencing \\nelections. One of those references read as follows: Today one can already predict the evolution of a weapons purpose; from weapons of \\ndestruction to weapons of deterrence and then to weapons of influence. Using such \\nweapons, it will be possible to exert long-range controlling effects on persons, and \\nconsequently on the course and results of election campaigns, on the decision-making of \\npresidents, prime ministers, and other high-ranking persons, and in this way to control \\nthe entire world.17 Again, this article appeared in 2004! The article further stated that it was the use of information \\ninfluence operations in the early 1990s that caused the USSR to cease to exist as a superpower. \\nThis is a reference to the belief that the US had conducted some sort of information-\\npsychological attack on the USSR that aided in the dissolution of the nation. Consideration Six: The Worries of Russian Cyber Planners2.6\\nWhat is a major worry of Russian cyber planners? Russian information experts have been discussing digital/cyber issues for many years. Their \\nefforts have included the drafting of a host of recommendations for consideration at the United \\nNations for review and adoption, such as consideration for the definition of an information \\nweapon over a decade ago. Several years later, during a 2010 Russian-sponsored conference in \\nGarmisch Germany, a member of the Russian delegation was asked to rank order threats as he \\nperceived them to Russia. Interestingly, escalation models were listed first. His concern clearly \\nwas that a cyber exchange could mistakenly get out of control, especially due to the use by \\nsome nations of surrogates or anonymous actors taking actions that responsible government \\nofficials would never consider. The risk associated with such gambles was simply too high. \\nSecond on the list of threats was the protection of civil infrastructures from attacks, which could \\nresult in the collapse of key banking or service-oriented (gas, electric, etc.) organizations, \\nresulting in chaos or confusion. Protection of critical infrastructure was listed as a priority \\nconcern. Definitions were next, as it was felt the ability to define concepts such as cyber-attacks, \\ncyber law, or other issues were key to keeping control over cyber-related issues and offering a \\nvenue for not only discussion but a common understanding of threat issues. Of lesser concern \\nto the individual was the threat of industrial espionage, most likely because Russian software \\ndevelopers had become so adept and invasive in this area. For both Russia and the US, there are \\nissues here that need to be discussed and settled. Peacetime is the place for the prevention of \\nescalation models, not after escalation occurs. 18 Conceptual Views Regarding the Activities of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in Information Space, \\nMinisterstvo Oborny Rossiyskoy Federatsii (Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation), 2011, p. 5.\\n19 Ibid.\\n20 V.

Hoffman, The Dead Hand, Doubleday, 2009, pp. 150-154 for a worrisome discussion of the Perimeter project. Consideration Seven: Reflexive Control and Cyber2.7\\nIs Russias concept of reflexive control operations a component of its information war concept? For at least the past 30 years, Russias military has employed a concept known as reflexive \\ncontrol (RC). In its simplest form, it means making someone do something for themselves that \\nthey are actually doing for you. A simple phishing attempt in cyberspace fits the definition \\nperfectly, as the initiator of the attack gets a person to do something for themselves (open a file \\nto see what is there based on misleading information in the e-mail), which allows a virus into \\nthe system. The e-mails initiator thus accomplishes his or her goal, as the e-mail recipients \\naction does your work. The use of analogies works the same way, as a person is led to believe \\nbased on an analogy (the Russians, in 2014, made the claim that many Ukrainians involved in \\nthe anti-government demonstrations in Kiev were Nazis) that he or she (a Russian) must fight \\nthem, as the analogy draws on a Russians reflexive response to World War II recollections. In 2011, Russias military published a document known as the Conceptual Views Regarding the \\nActivities of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in Information Space.18 The definition \\nof information war discussed damage done to information systems, potential damage to the \\nstability of society via brainwashing, and, at the end of the definition, stated that information \\nwars confrontation was for forcing the state to make decisions in the interests of the \\nconfronting party.19 Thus, when defining information war, the Russians included the RC \\nconcept, although most Western readers of the definition would not spot it. In 2015, V. G. Kazakov and A. N. Kirishin wrote an article on RC for the Journal of the Academy \\nof Military Science.20 They noted that the commander needs a special group (outside the Table \\nof Organization and Equipment) with information-psychological qualifications to develop and \\ntransmit the use of RC measures together with command control (readiness to execute \\nassigned tasks) actions. This is done through the spreading of information packets on the \\nbattlefield. An information packet could be a fake electronic warfare transmission that \\ninfluences conditions. There was a diagram that accompanied this explanation, showing how \\ncommand control and RC fit together to manipulate an enemys decision-making process. Consideration Eight: Is There a Cyber Dead Hand?2.8\\nHas Russia developed a cyber dead hand like its nuclear dead hand concept in the past? \\nDoes the military have an Intranet to ensure the security of military information as a different \\ntype of backup system? In 1985, the Soviet Union tested and put on alert status a system known as Perimeter.21 It was \\ndesigned to deliver a nuclear strike against the US if the latters nuclear weaponry destroyed the 22 David E. Hoffman, The Dead Hand, Doubleday, 2009, pp. 150-154.\\n23 V. F. Samokhin, V. N. Lukyanchik, and A. N. Artyushenko, Prospects for a Military (Combat) Internet in the New Look \\nRussian Armed Forces, Voennaya Mysl (Military Thought), No. 8 2011, pp. 57-60.\\n24 Ibid.\\n25 V. I. Kuznetsov, Yu. Ye. Donskov, and A. S. Korobeynikov, About the Question of the Role and Place of Cyberspace in \\nModern Military Operations, Voennaya Mysl (Military Thought), No. 3 2014, pp. 14-16.\\n26 Ibid. USSRs leaders and command systems before they could retaliate [or if an electronic warfare \\nstrike took out the USSRs rocket force command and control capability]. The system consisted \\nof missile launches from a secret bunker that could in reality throw down codes to ICBMs in \\ncase the nations leadership was rendered helpless and unable to transmit codes to the Kazbek \\nlaunch system. In times of tension, the system (and the officers in a bunker) might be activated in an advance \\npreparation fashion. The Perimeter system would apparently be used not only if contact was \\nlost with the leadership but if special sensors also indicated radioactivity, seismic shocks, and \\natmospheric overpressure, all signs of a nuclear strike. In that sense the system was \\nsemiautomatic, as its use still rested on people in the bunker making a final decision. An \\nautomatic system was also contemplated (a Dead Hand) but apparently discarded, since it \\nrelied solely on computers and took people out of the launch process.22 In 2011, in the journal Military Thought, it was reported that there were prospects for what was \\ntermed a military (combat) Internet in the Russian Armed Forces. Information was viewed as a \\ndecisive factor in achieving strategic and operational-tactical superiority over an adversary on \\nthe battlefield. Information superiority enables speed and timely decision-making on the \\nmodern battlefield. Improvements in the strategic control system through installing digital and \\ntelecommunications equipment was designated as priority one for these reasons.23 It was noted \\nthat many people writing on this subject tend to support development of a new Russian \\nsegment, Intranet Russian Federation and that it could be protected against outside threats \\nand have no risks of dependence on foreign assistance in technical problem fixing.24 Consideration Nine: Battlefield Influence Operations2.9\\nHow has the military used cyberspace to influence the population and actions on the \\nbattlefield? On the battlefield, operations in cyberspace have signaled Russias entrance into an entirely \\nnew type of warfare. It is, according to experts, a combination of information and information \\ninfrastructure designed and used on the battlefield to shape, generate, transform, transit, use, \\nand store information in computers and computer networks. Cyberspace is essential for \\noperations in any modern control system and is the most prioritized element of a battlespace in \\nthe broadest sense. The authors of one article noted that the formation of cyberspace as a new \\nrealm of combat operations called for a revision of ideas held about the forms and",
