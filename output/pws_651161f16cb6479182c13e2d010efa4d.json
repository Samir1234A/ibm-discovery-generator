  "text": "the FAA and the aviation community to develop the operational concepts and procedures and the requirements for these Data Comm capabilities. We also performed operational testing to help ensure the successful integration and use of data communications throughout U.S. airspace. In 2016, the FAA provided Data Comm capabilities for use at 56 airports across the country. This has already resulted in shorter communication times, faster taxi-outs, and reduced delays. By the end of 2018, as many as 2,400 aircraft will be equipped with Data Comm capabilities. In 2019, the FAA plans to implement Data Comm services in its high-altitude air traffic control centers, extending the advantages of these services even further. n 12 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t 2,400 \\naircraft will be equipped with \\nData Comm Capabilities by 2018 13T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n 14 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t Tapping the Potential of \\nNew Space Capabilities 1,100 active satellites are currently orbiting Earth Constellations of commercial satellites are imaging Earth with increasing frequency and accuracy. Theyre providing content for \\nnavigation systems, business analytics, and global economics. This has led to a New Space vision: diverse commercial satellite imagery and analysis as low-cost commodities available to all. Multiple government agencies are seeking to tap the potential of New Space. The possibilities are far-reaching: mission planning, reconnaissance operations, disaster relief, resource conservation, and transportation security. MITRE is playing a vital role in helping the government take advantage of this emerging markets promise. MITRE is providing technical modeling and analysis to help government sponsors decide how and when to incorporate commercial space into their overall missions, investments, and acquisition strategies. We are also developing mission-driven analytics to add mission value from commercial offerings. Were piloting these in operational prototypes to address novel applications for our nations most challenging problems. n 15T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n Combating the Growing \\nThreat to Our Space Assets AFSPC, MITRE, Aerospace Corp., Lincoln Lab, and RAND helped create a Space Enterprise Vision Today, the United States must be prepared for attacks on our national security space systems as they travel through space. \\nChinas recent demonstrations of anti-satellite weapons are the most visible examples of the emerging threats to our space assets. In response, the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) asked for MITREs help in creating a Space Enterprise Vision (SEV) outlining how the military should address the increasing dangers to communications, navigation, and other space-based capabilities. The AFSPC brought together a team of FFRDCs to support that effort, asking MITRE to serve as co-lead. In October 2016, the team delivered the SEV to AFSPC, and it quickly gained acceptance across senior levels of the DoD and intelligence community. The SEV is now being used to guide planning choices, resource decisions, and requirements development across the DoD and the intelligence community. n 16 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t Space assets \\ninclude communications, \\nnavigation, surveillance, \\nmeteorological sensing, and \\nthreat detection 17T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n 18 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t Transforming Indonesias \\nAviation System In 2015, Indonesia launched an effort to modernize all aspects of its civil aviation operations. The International Air Transport \\nAssociation (IATA) predicts that Indonesia will become one of the worlds 10 largest passenger markets by 2020 and the fifth largest domestic market by 2034. Indonesias modernization program will therefore have long-term benefits. The initiativeknown as Indonesia Modernization of Air Navigation Services (IMANS)calls for developing new operations concepts, implementing advanced air traffic management systems, updating procedures, and better integrating Indonesias operations with those of other nations in the region. Starting in November 2015, MITRE worked with AirNav Indonesiathe countrys air navigation service providerto expedite the identification and deployment of the capabilities needed to fulfill the IMANS vision. In September 2016, MITRE provided a comprehensive concept of operations for the modernization effort. n IATA predicts that Indonesia will become one of the worlds 10 largest passenger markets by 2020 MITREs work in the Asia Pacific region is helping deliver harmonized aviation \\nsolutions 19T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n Judicial Analytics \\nCreates Cost Savings Under the federal district courts Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) system, all pending civil cases of a similar type are transferred to a single judge. \\nIn some MDLs, a court can receive upward of 6,000 new filings each day and face a backlog of up to 80,000 pending complaints. To better manage its own cases, one MDL court sought to capture pertinent items of data from each pending case file. This effort, the Office of the Clerk determined, would require 14 new staff, take four months to complete, and cost $400,000. The challenge was that the case documents are processed as PDF files, a format from which most automated systems cannot reliably retrieve specific data. Thats where MITREs expertise and independent status came in. After one week, nearly 95 percent of the desired data was compiled, eliminating the need for the costly solution the MDL court had originally anticipated. n A court can \\nreceive upward of \\n6,000 new filings each day 20 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t 21T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n 22 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t In 2015, almost 300 million \\nrecords were leaked, \\nand more than $1 billion \\nwas stolen worldwide by cyber hackers Protecting Taxpayer \\nIdentities Get Transcript enables users to obtain their tax transcripts online As Americans increasingly rely on the Internet for their business transactions, the amount of personal information accessible online \\nhas grown substantially, making it vulnerable to hacking. Many users business transactions require copies of their tax returns. The IRS therefore offers a service, Get Transcript, to enable users to quickly obtain copies of their tax transcripts online. This past year, when the IRS was strengthening the security features of the Get Transcript application, it called on MITRE to evaluate the systems security to assess its readiness for deployment. MITREs cybersecurity experts tested all components of the Get Transcript system as well as its supporting eAuthentication service, which verifies the users identity, and identified a few areas for improvement. In particular, we recommended the use of the latest multi- factor authentication techniques to prevent unauthorized access. The IRS acted on MITREs independent recommendations, thus providing greater protections for taxpayer data. Taxpayers everywhere are the beneficiaries of the IRSs and MITREs diligence. n 23T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n Analyzing Social Media to \\nPrevent Terrorist Attacks In December 2015, homegrown extremists inspired by a foreign terrorist group killed 14 people and injured 22 others in an attack in San Bernardino, California. How were they inspired? \\nVia social media and the Internet. To help prevent such attacks both at home and abroad, the federal government immediately created a team to examine how social media analytics could be applied to the screening and vetting of individuals traveling or seeking immigration benefits. The team included personnel from DHS, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the MITRE-operated Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute (HSSEDITM) FFRDC. The team members used their knowledge of media, international social media sites, and language processing to review open source and social media analytic capabilities and technologies. Ultimately, they evaluated more than 270 social media tools for their potential for addressing critical mission areas. They highlighted solutions for accessing some 30 social media platforms on the Internet and darknets, using data sets in more than 120 languages. They also discovered problems with existing analytic capabilities, which were quickly improved for government agencies use. The teams work is now serving as the national testbed for establishing the DHS Social Media Center. Their work also helped DHS improve its capabilities, achieve operational efficiencies, and lower costs through the automation of advanced analytics, thereby advancing the agencys overall goals. n Facebook has over 1.7 billion active users 24 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t 25T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n 26 M I",
