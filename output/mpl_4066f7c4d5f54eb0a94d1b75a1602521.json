Approved for public release. Distribution unlimited. Case No.: 17-4761 McLean, VA Approved By Robert C. Strain, P123 Date\\nDepartment Head Elida C. Smith, H530 Date\\nPortfolio Manager iii Abstract\\nThis HITL simulation activity was designed to examine the integration of a relative spacing\\nconcept (Interval Management [IM]) into a future absolute spacing terminal metering\\nenvironment provided by Terminal Sequencing and Spacing (TSAS). Air traffic controllers and\\nflight crews utilized current day automation capabilities with enhancements for terminal\\nmetering and IM to test the integration for acceptability and necessary spacing awareness\\ninformation. Both groups had different sets of spacing information that were examined across\\nseveral traffic scenarios. The results indicate IM is compatible with terminal metering, but the\\nappropriate controller and flight crew tools to support trust of IM should continue to be\\nexamined. Concept and operational recommendations are made, including enhancements to\\nIM-related displays. iv Executive Summary\\nA human-in-the-loop simulation involving air traffic controller and flight crews was conducted\\nto examine the integration of Interval Management (IM) into a time-based, terminal metering\\nenvironment with Performance Based Navigation procedures. Time-based metering during\\narrival operations is currently scheduled to the runway, but is only conducted in the en route\\nenvironment. However, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) plans to deploy capabilities\\nand procedures to extend time-based metering into the terminal environment by 2019 via\\nTerminal Sequencing and Spacing (TSAS). IM introduces a new way for the controller to have\\naircraft meet the terminal schedule, and the goal of the simulation was to test the integration\\nof the concepts for acceptability and the necessary spacing awareness information. IM is a set of equipment capabilities and procedures for controllers and flight crews. Flight deck\\ncapabilities are used to support a range of IM operations with a goal of managed inter-aircraft\\nspacing. Ground tools can be used to support the set-up and monitoring of the IM operation. To\\ninitiate IM, the controller issues an IM clearance with the appropriate information such as the\\nAssigned Spacing Goal (ASG) and the lead aircraft identification. The flight crew enters that\\ninformation into the flight deck IM equipment, which then provides speeds to fly to achieve\\nand, if desired, maintain that ASG. Situation awareness information is also provided to assist\\nthe flight crew in monitoring the progression of IM. The controller monitors the operation for\\nspacing or separation issues and intervenes if any unusual spacing issues arise. Under normal\\nconditions, the flight crew continues following the IM speeds and the controller continues\\nmonitoring the operation until the aircraft reaches the planned termination point, where the\\nspacing goal is met. At this point, the flight deck IM equipment removes the IM speed from the\\ndisplays and IM is nominally terminated. IM improves spacing consistency and predictability by enabling flight crews to make more\\nfrequent and efficient speed adjustments than are possible for a controller to provide using\\nonly a ground-based metering capability and voice communications. Achieving a consistent,\\nlow-variance spacing interval reduces the time interval between aircraft in a traffic flow, which\\nallows each aircraft to be spaced closer to a given separation standard. This enables increased\\narrival throughput and sector or facility capacity. During IM / relative spacing, the IM aircraft performs spacing adjustment relative to a lead\\naircraft. In absolute spacing with TSAS, spacing adjustments are made with respect to crossing a\\nspecific location at a designated time, independent of the lead aircraft (once the schedule is\\nfrozen). When using the TSAS tools during terminal metering, the controller actively issues\\nspeed instructions to aircraft to get them on schedule. During IM operations, flight crews fly\\nspeeds generated by the flight deck equipment to achieve the ASG. While the IM aircraft is\\nworking toward the ASG, it may not be clear to the controller how well the operation is\\nprogressing or whether an aircraft will ultimately achieve the ASG and the underlying schedule.\\nThe controller may also find the absolute spacing information provided by TSAS to be confusing\\nfor IM operations. This could cause the controller to be concerned about the IM aircraft and\\npotentially not trust or utilize IM, thereby reducing the expected benefits. v For flight crews, IM during terminal metering looks very similar to IM in other environments\\nthat has been examined in past simulations. However, additional study of spacing awareness\\ntools for IM in this new environment was deemed necessary to help validate the minimum\\ndisplay requirements being defined by avionics standards organizations such as RTCA. Past\\nwork has shown that certain features can support spacing awareness and others can cause\\nconfusion. Additional work is necessary to finalize minimum requirements. Some past work has examined IM and TSAS integration. This HITL builds on it by: increasing the\\npercentage of aircraft conducting IM, examining IM initiation in the terminal environment,\\nintegrating the IM algorithm defined in RTCAs technical standards, and continued examination\\nof flight deck and ground human information requirements. Nine air traffic controllers and 18 pilots conducted IM during terminal metering under different\\nconditions: the independent variables of display information for the controller (a basic\\nimplementation with IM clearance information and IM status information, the basic\\nimplementation plus an IM status visual cue, or the basic implementation plus an IM status\\nvisual cue and a spacing prediction) and pilot (a minimum implementation as specified in\\nstandards or a minimum plus enhancements), and role of the controller (feeder or final) and\\npilot. Controllers also experienced aircraft overtake conditions during IM that required an\\nintervention, as well as conditions where aircraft were conducting IM prior to entering the\\nterminal airspace. IM operations during terminal metering was found acceptable by controllers and flight crews. A\\nvast majority of IM operations were initiated and only a few were suspended or terminated by\\ncontrollers. The IM / relative spacing operation was very similar to the behavior of controllers\\nwho transition from an absolute spacing operation to a relative spacing operation in the later\\nstages of approach and landing during terminal metering operations. All aircraft spent a majority of their flying time on the Area Navigation (RNAV) arrivals.\\nHowever, IM aircraft spent more time on the RNAV arrivals (which indicated less time being\\nvectored) and had reduced spacing variance at the final approach fix when compared to non-IM\\naircraft. IM and non-IM aircraft met the expected performance baselines and goals. Controller terminal metering tools did not appear to conflict with IM operations and several\\nappeared to provide useful information for IM aircraft. The basic controller IM tool set was\\nfound to be useful and helpful. The additional tools that were evaluated also appeared useful,\\nthough no clear trends for benefits were found. For the flight crew displays, the basic IM tool\\nset (based on published minimum requirements) was found acceptable on several measures.\\nHowever, trends for the enhanced tool set indicate that additional features may be useful and\\novercome issues if refined and implemented properly. Few to no comments were received\\nabout a need for additional display features beyond the min or min+ tool sets. While IM appeared to work well in this environment, some level of discomfort in IM was\\nobserved. Based on controller comments, this seemed to be related to not actively issuing\\nspeeds to IM aircraft and thus not knowing what speeds would be flown and when. For flight\\ncrews, the distrust seemed to be related uncertainty around the feasibility of the IM operation.\\nRecommendations for addressing topics such as these are included in this report. Suggestions vi are also made for further work to understand and resolve additional issues. The results and\\nrecommendations are intended to be used by the FAA and RTCA in developing IM operational,\\nsafety, performance, and interface requirements. The results will also inform the FAAs\\ndevelopment of ground requirements to enable IM operations in metering environments. vii Acknowledgments\\nThis research was completed with funding from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Next\\nGeneration Air Transportation System (NextGen) Human Factors Division (ANG-C1) in support\\nof the Aircraft Certification (AIR) and the Flight Standards Service (AFS).
