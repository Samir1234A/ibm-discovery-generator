  "sdl_extracted_summary": "similar topological manners in an effort to make the comparison more similar. Moreover, a physical (or functional) network of smaller size than a larger physical network, is strictly a subgraph of the larger. In all instances, the number of Non-Leaf Physical Nodes is equal to the number of Non-Leaf Functional Nodes. Figure 4 shows the results over runs between 5% and 95% of the nodes being Leaf nodes. Hypothesis 3 is supported by observing how the gray boxes form a hill like structure across each row. 4 Conclusion This work extends the viewpoint of functional analysis to incorporate physical realities through the interlocking of two different modeling approaches. Four problems are introduced and explored on instances with hundreds of nodes. The first three capture how to combine the two different models into one holistic model. For these three models, computational experiments demonstrate the relationship between the difficulty of the holistic model to the difficulties of the individual components. The fourth model demonstrates how network properties, such as the links used for network traffic, can contribute as inputs to functional analysis. These ideas are precursors to future work exploring imperfect information for attacks, whole system defensive network design. The work on observation opens many questions on how to successfully implement network properties into 13 functional analysis within a decision support tool context.

A FDNA Functional networks which takes inputs and calculates a series of dependencies to determine the overall MOE of a system. For this paper, existing code for robust FDNA is expanded upon, but the ideas present are not exclusive to FDNA. Each node in a FDNA tree is said to have an operability level between 0 and 100, where the operability of the root node is the MOE. The operability of children in a FDNA tree, an value determining weighted average, and a limitation on the scalar difference between each child and its parent, determine the operability of each parent node. SET CONDITION DESCRIPTION F Set of FDNA nodes L L F Leaf nodes J J = F\\\\L Set of children for each node PARAMETER CONDITION DESCRIPTION ij i F, j J (i) Weighted multiplier ij i F, j J (i) Weighted scalar b Budget for attacks VARIABLE CONDITION DESCRIPTION Pi i F Operability of node i 15 The essential Equation 18 is used to calculate a parent operability once the operability of each node is known. For this paper, binary indicator variables w on the leaf nodes determine if a leaf node has either a High or Low operability level, which are taken as input. The Mixed Integer Program formulations to either minimize or maximize are based on this equation. Pi = min 100\\n1 |J (i)| jJ (i) (100 Pj)ij , min\\njJ (i) [Pj + ij ] (18) Robust can be thought of as a way of assuming mistakes are made within a model. A value will determine how many parameters were wrong, then additional inputs can be used to determine how far off a parameter may be. Solving for the robustness will require the solutions to account for worst case parameter mistakes, thus preventing mistakes letting a solution looking being too good to be true. Two values and can be independently input to the problem to explore how the MOE is impacted based on how inaccurate the parameters may have been. See ?? for a detailed explanation on implementing robustness into FDNA. This paper will use the and to show those FDNA ideas extend to Problem 1 and Problem 1 for free. B Functional Physical Attack with Observation The key to unlocking these problem 1 is evaluating how network traffic patterns are impacted by the compromising of nodes, which may be utilized to reroute traffic to cross preplaced observers in the network. This is a challenging model to formulate due to uncertainty of existing network patterns, but the use of robust FDNA networks to evaluate success can aid in taking a simplified formulation and hedging against uncertainty. B.1 Formulation If attacks are thought of as severely limiting the functionality of a physical node, there may be additional consequences not fully captured by only measuring the overall functionality through a decision tree calculation. An attacked may have the ability to observe network traffic at certain places within the physical network, so destroying the capability of a node may simultaneously limit their ability to gather information. This section will expand the Steiner Attack problem with a second objective which maximizes the ability to observe network traffic. The initial assumption will be that there are existing nodes in N\\\\N0 which have observers on them, and the defender is unaware of their existence. The second assumption will be that network traffic occurs between any pair of nodes, and must not travel through the outside network represented by N0. The third assumption is that network traffic is uncapacitated. The fourth assumption is that communication 16 between two nodes will always take the resulting shortest path within the net- work, and, for the sake of being conservative, network paths of equal length are lexicographically shorter if they are not incident with an observer than if they are. The third and fourth assumptions are the most pressing to expand upon. The problem lies in a nuance about network flows and determining how a network should prioritize routing traffic at nodes that meet capacity. With shortest path, a lexicographic preference towards traffic not being monitored implies all shortest paths must have a monitor for the attacker to successfully monitor traffic. However, if flow, any designed in preferences for routing traffic could cause unintelligently biased solution preferences. Some work needs to be done to make it work. Even the more extreme requiring of a cut consisting of observers between a sender and receiver to claim traffic is observed does not work, as if the cut is a bottleneck for traffic the model must determine what traffic is sent though. Even more of a reason to make the third and fourth assumptions is the question of how much information is known. To incorporate capacities, there must be a realistic notion of all traffic within the system. The existing monitors may provide some of this information, but not likely all of it. Furthermore, with capacities the model must know the routing mechanisms in place within the network. The unlikelihood of a reasonable model of these attributes complicates trying to measure the network traffic. For now, with no capacity, the initial model for observers can use shortest path, and the imperfect information can be reflected by utilizing robust optimization of uncertain",

  "text": "parameters and \\nlogic that can impact the arrival management tool (i.e., general airspace, routing, runways, or scheduling constraints). \\nThe airspace and associated procedures (i.e. PBN enabled Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STARs) or Instrument \\nApproach Procedures (IAPs)) also play a key role in the adaptation and in turn the operational success of the arrival \\nmanagement DST. This section provides an overview of the current and upcoming generation arrival management technologies along \\nwith the associated processes that are currently in place for adapting the tools and for creating the published arrival \\nprocedures. A. Arrival Management and Time Based Metering \\nAs previously indicated, in the United States, arrival management is being provided through the use of arrival time-based scheduling and management DSTs, which are enabled by the TBFM system. Time-based scheduling (aka. \\nmetering) of arrival flows is not a new concept in air traffic management. The original concept of metering goes \\nback to at least the mid 1970s with the development of the En Route Metering (ERM) program. The ERM program \\n(1970s-80s) was based on a simple concept of proactively spacing out the flights in en-route based on projected \\ndemand to avoid excessive holding and vectoring near the destination airport and was deployed as part of the en-route \\nautomation system. The second-generation metering tool was an evolution of the ERM system into the first national \\nmetering program called Arrival Sequencing Program (ASP) (1980s-90s) which started to introduce low fidelity \\naircraft trajectory prediction calculations as part of the scheduling. American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 4 The current generation TBFM system, which is based on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \\n(NASA) Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) system, is the third generation of time-based metering tools. TMA was \\na component of the CenterTRACON Automation System (CTAS), a suite of air traffic management tools developed \\nat NASA Ames Research Center [6]. The system was technology transferred to the Federal Aviation Administration \\n(FAA) and was first deployed in the early 2000s. The TMA system continued to expand and evolve. In 2003 the \\nAdjacent Center Metering (ACM) capability was developed which allowed multiple en-route systems to provide input \\nto TMA, effectively removing center boundaries for traffic management purposes. In 2006 the En-route departure \\n(EDC) capability was added which extended the metering concept to managing departures. By August 2007, TMA \\nwas deployed at all ARTCCs in the United States. TMA evolved into what is now called TBFM, which included a \\ncomplete re-architecture and modernization of the technology. Recent enhancements to TBFM include the addition of \\ncoupled and extended metering capabilities which increase the operational range of TBFM as well as meet time speed \\nadvisories which controllers can utilize to achieve TBFM generated schedules. In addition to the current generation TBFM technologies, there are currently plans to implement an emerging \\ntechnology that enhances TBFM, which is called the Terminal Sequencing and Spacing (TSAS) capability developed \\nby NASA [15]. TSAS enhances TBFM to apply time-based metering operations in the terminal environment with the \\nobjective of reducing tactical decision-making related to aircraft sequencing and spacing, and to enable mixed \\nequipage use of both curved-path PBN procedures (i.e., procedures that contain Radius to Fix (RF) legs) as well as \\nmore traditional PBN and RNAV procedures (i.e., procedures that only contain Track to Fix (TF) legs). TSAS achieves \\nthese objectives by providing terminal airspace merging and spacing tools that are used for time-based metering \\noperations. \\nFigure 1. Evolution of Arrival Management Decision Support Tools. \\n As indicated in Figure 1, with each evolution starting from the original ERM/ASP metering programs to current \\ngeneration TMA/TBFM technologies and moving towards planned next generation technologies [14], theres a shift \\nto more precise trajectory prediction and scheduling methodologies which in turn rely on increasing congruence \\nbetween the arrival management DST adaptation and published procedure conformance. Although this paper focuses on arrival management tools in the U.S. (i.e. TBFM) and its evolution under the Next \\nGeneration Air Transportation System (NextGen) program, prevalent use of arrival management technologies also \\nexists in Europe as well as emerging use in Asia. Unlike in the U.S., Europe has a variety of arrival management tools \\navailable with different levels of functionality [16]. However, some arrival management DSTs that are currently in \\noperation, such as the Means to Aid Expedition and Sequencing of Traffic with Research of Optimization \\n(MAESTRO) built by the French Centre d'Etudes de la Navigation Aerienne [8] and the Computer Oriented \\nMetering, Planning and Advisory System (COMPAS) build by German Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR) \\n[9], have a similar foundation and origin as the TMA/TBFM system first proposed by the NASA Ames Research \\nCenter [7]. Given that they are undergoing a similar evolution as TBFM under the umbrella European Single European \\nSky ATM Research (SESAR) [2] program, it is expected that many of the concepts and elements presented here could \\nbe translated to those systems as well. B. PBN Procedure Development \\nPerformance Based Navigation (PBN) comprises Area Navigation (RNAV) and Required Navigation Performance (RNP) and describes an aircrafts ability to navigate using performance standards. RNAV enables aircraft to fly on \\nany desired flight path within the coverage of ground or space-based navigation aids. RNP is RNAV with the addition \\nof an onboard performance monitoring and alerting capability. A defining characteristic of RNP operations is the \\nability of the aircraft navigation system to monitor the navigation performance it achieves and inform the crew if the \\nrequirement is not met during an operation. Based on the FAA PBN National Airspace System (NAS) Navigation \\nStrategy, by 2030, PBN procedures and flexible routing will be the standard method of navigation throughout the NAS \\nduring normal operating conditions. Utilization of PBN procedures is expected to be greatly enabled using advanced \\nDSTs that will need to be tightly integrated [4]. American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 5 The process for developing and implementing PBN procedures in the NAS is well-documented in the PBN \\nDevelopment \\nPreliminary Activities, Development Work, Operational Preparations, Implementation, and Post-Implementation \\nMonitoring and Evaluation [3]. \\nFigure 2. PBN Development & Implementation Process [3] The PBN Development & Implementation Process focuses on performing upfront work to determine whether the \\nproject should be undertaken including achieving consensus from the Regional Airspace & Procedures Team (RAPT) \\nprior to starting development. Following these preliminary activities, development and preparatory work is conducted \\nprior to implementation. Lastly, post-implementation analysis is performed to capture any implementation issues that \\narose and lessons learned for future projects. This process has been successfully applied to many PBN projects in \\nrecent years throughout the NAS. When following the PBN Development and Implementation processes, various tools are employed to support the \\nteams in executing their work. The primary tool for PBN procedure design is the FAAs capability called Terminal \\nArea Route Generation, Evaluation, and Traffic Simulation (TARGETS). TARGETS provides a common platform \\nthat enables procedure designers to leverage various navigation data sources to develop PBN procedures, evaluate \\nthose procedures against the latest FAA design criteria, and to evaluate the flyability of a design utilizing aircraft \\nperformance models. TARGETS also generates the required documentation required for operational preparations prior \\nto implementing the new or modified procedure. Depending upon the extent of the change to a PBN procedure or if the procedure is part of a larger redesign effort, \\nHuman-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations may be utilized to evaluate the procedures in various operational scenarios. \\nThese operational scenarios are evaluated in real-time with air traffic controllers to elicit feedback on the suitability \\nof the new operations. The HITL assessments lead to design refinements based on the perceived operational suitability, \\nmaking HITL simulations a critically important tool for larger PBN redesign projects where the impact of the design \\nchanges may not be well understood. C. TBFM Adaptation Process \\nIntegration of PBN procedure design and TBFM adapted metering design is considered critical to the implementation of TBO. The current PBN/TBFM system design and adaptation process can take several months and \\nthere are limited tools available to design teams to help with this process. Existing TBFM adaptation tools do not \\neffectively support concurrent visualization/modification of procedures and TBFM adaptation elements, or enable \\nassessment of the impact of proposed designs on flight operations. Compared to PBN, TBFM adaptation development and implementation processes are not as standardized or fully \\ndocumented. The TBFM system requires that facility adaptation be developed and maintained to ensure desired \\nperformance is achieved and that the adaptation is consistent with the local operations. The development and \\nmaintenance activities are performed when new procedures are implemented, existing procedures are changed, or \\nTBFM system performance changes are desired. The TBFM adaptation data consists of many hundreds of distinct \\nfiles which use a complex syntax to specify the TBFM adaptation elements defined in the TBFM Interface Control \\nDocument (ICD) [10]. Changes are made using careful configuration management practices and are applied on top of \\na baseline representing the current TBFM adaptation at a facility. The adaptation is modified manually by editing the \\nfile, or set of files, requiring a change to work with the operational TBFM system. Evaluation tools are used to analyze \\nadaptation files for syntax",
