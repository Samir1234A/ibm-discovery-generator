The key provisions of the \\ndocument are the Essential Eight [22]. Because this report has included the Essential Eight in the \\nmapping of the Practice Guide, the inclusion of Cyber Security for Contractors publication \\nwould be repetitive. Further, the publication recommends that contractors review the guidelines \\npublished by the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC). While the ACSCs guidelines are \\nnot specifically related to mobile devices, the reader concerned with mobile device security \\nshould review Cloud Computing Security for Tenants, which lists essential mitigations for data \\ncompromise [23]. As discussed earlier in this report, mobile devices often leverage cloud \\nservices during business operations. \\n15 4.2.3 Essential Eight ASDs Essential Eight as documented in the Essential Eight Explained build on ASDs previous \\nTop 4 Mitigation Strategies for Targeted Cyber Intrusions with the goal of being a cybersecurity \\nbaseline for organizations [22]. The research undertaken for this project found the Essential \\nEight to be widely used in Australia, even beyond government organizations, and that they also \\nhave some applicability to mobile devices. Therefore, we use the Essential Eight as a basis for \\nmapping to the guidelines found in the Practice Guide. 4.2.4 ISO 27001/27002 The International Organization of Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical \\nCommission (IEC) 27000 series of standards is applicable to any entity implementing a mobile \\ndevice security solution. The Practice Guide includes ISO/IEC 27002, which provides best-\\npractice recommendations on implementing security in its security characteristics mapping. ISO \\n27002 is included in the currently published version of the Practice Guide; therefore, it is not \\naddressed separately in this document. Those seeking information on how ISO 27002 relates to a \\nmobile device security implementation should review the Practice Guide. 4.2.5 NIST Cybersecurity Framework Published in February 2014 by NIST, the Cybersecurity Framework is a guide for entities \\nseeking to employ a flexible, risk-based, and comprehensive cybersecurity program. The \\nframework itself is not a standard; rather, it is an approach developed in consensus with industry \\nthat is based on standards. The core of the framework includes five functions: identify, protect, \\ndetect, respond, and recover. The functions are broken down further into subcategories and \\ncross-referenced with other commonly used standards. The framework provides the basis for the \\nPractice Guide. The full mapping of the Practice Guide to the Cybersecurity Framework can be \\nfound in Appendix A. 4.2.6 Risk Management of Enterprise Mobility Including Bring Your Own Device The Risk Management of Enterprise Mobility Including Bring Your Own Device published by \\nASD provides relevant information for organizations considering deploying a bring your own \\ndevice (BYOD) policy. It explores risk tolerance and business usage; however, it is not included \\nin our mapping because its focus is on business cases rather than practical implementation \\nguidelines. 4.2.7 Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) The Protective Security Policy Framework, authored by Australias Attorney-Generals \\nDepartment, takes a broad approach to security that includes governance, personnel security, \\ninformation security, and physical security. Australian government agencies are required to \\ncomply with its 36 requirements, and it is provided to state and territory governments as a \\nholistic model for public-sector security management. Because it is a high-level document \\nwithout a direct correlation to the technical recommendations in the Practice Guide and it applies \\nto the Australian government, it is not included in the mapping provided in the next section. \\n16 4.2.8 Information Security Manual The ISM, authored by ASD, is the flagship document for the application of risk-based \\ninformation security principles and controls for Australian government agencies, thereby \\nfunctioning as the standard that governs the security of Australian government information and \\ncommunication technology (ICT) systems. [24]. The ISMs suggested audience is Information \\nTechnology Security Advisors, Information Technology Security Managers, Information \\nSecurity Registered Assessors and other security practitioners across government. The role and \\ntechnical skill level of this audience is similar to the Practice Guides target audience in its Part \\nB, which is focused on chief information officers, chief information security officers, and \\nsecurity managers. While the ISM is focused on federal agencies, it is mapped to the Practice \\nGuide because of its flagship status on Australian cybersecurity. 4.2.9 Information Security Management Guidelines: Risk Management of \\nOutsourced ICT Arrangements Information Security Management Guidelines: Risk Management of Outsourced ICT \\nArrangements (Including Cloud), authored by Australias Attorney-Generals Department, is \\nintended for government agencies. While much of the information included in this document \\nmay benefit any organization considering cloud services, it is tailored to government needs only. \\nAlso, it is primarily aimed at the organizational and policy levels. Thus, it is not included in the \\nmapping of the Practice Guide. 4.2.10 Information Security Registered Assessors Program (IRAP) IRAP is an ASD initiative to ensure that individuals conducting cybersecurity assessments have \\nan appropriate skill level to produce consistent quality. IRAP is not a standard, though it is often \\nmistaken to be such; rather, it demonstrates that IRAP members have attained the experience, \\nsecurity certifications, and technical understanding to independently assess systems against the \\nISM and Protective Security Policy Framework. This program is especially important for entities \\nthat desire to provide IT services to Australian government agencies (and increasingly adopted \\nby state and territory governments) due to the ASDs recommendation of compliance with IRAP \\nbefore procurement. IRAP is included on the list of identified standards as MITRE research \\nfound it frequently referenced, at times, as if it were a standard. IRAP leverages the ISM as a \\nbasis for assessment of technical controls for services that go through the accreditation process. \\nIt does not apply in the context of mobile device security for SMEs. Because it is not an actual \\nstandard and applies only to government or entities opting in to IRAP, it is not mapped to the \\nPractice Guide. 4.2.11 Privacy Guidelines The Office of the Australian Information Comminssioners (OAIC) Guide to Securing Personal \\nInformation provides technical guidelines that businesses can use to comply with the Australian \\nPrivacy Principles requirements [25]. This research uses the Guide to Securing Personal \\nInformation as a basis for mapping to the guidelines found in the Practice Guide. It is important \\nto note that this mapping is limited to the extent that the findings and recommendations from the \\nOAIC guidelines are limited to personal information and that the Practice Guide includes any \\ndata. Additionally, the OAIC guide includes specific reference to mobile devices that were not \\n17 included in the mapping in this report. General guidelines are provided for businesses to adopt \\npolicies regarding the use of mobile devices, including the separation of business and personal \\ndata, password protection, and an awareness program for employees regarding the risks of using \\npersonal devices for business activities. \\nWhile the OAIC guide is beneficial to organizations with mobile devices, it lacks the technical \\nspecificity necessary for mapping to the Practice Guide. Additionally, the Guide to Securing \\nPersonal Information refers to the OAICs Mobile PrivacyA Better Practice Guide for \\nMobile App Developers [26]. While useful for entities that develop mobile applications within \\ntheir own organizations, the Practice Guide used mobile applications provided by commercial \\nvendors and therefore did not include any mobile application development recommendations for \\nprivacy protection. For the purposes of the project, it is assumed that most SMEs will be users of \\nmobile applications and not developers of mobile applications. However, in circumstances where \\nAustralian organizations, particularly start-ups, develop applications to support their businesses, \\nthis guide is useful. Laws, Standards, and Guidelines Mapping \\nMITRE analyzed the laws, standards, and guidelines identified in Section 4 of this report and \\ndetermined that three of the documents were directly relevant to mobile device security \\nguidelines contained within the Practice Guide. This section provides a detailed analysis showing \\nhow the most relevant Australian laws, standards, and guidelines map to the Practice Guide. It \\nincludes tables that illustrate how specific controls found in the Australian documents align to \\ncomparable elements within the Practice Guide. For example, in Table 2, which compares the \\nISM to the Practice Guide, the Security Characteristic column identifies elements from the \\nPractice Guide that are needed to reduce the risk from mobile devices storing or accessing \\nenterprise data. The Example Capability column, taken from the Practice Guide, identifies \\ntechnical features that can be applied to address the accompanied security characteristic. The \\nfinal column, Information Security Manual Control, shows how technical controls align to the Practice Guides corresponding security characteristics. 5.1 Information Security Manual \\nThis section maps the ISM Control Manual to guidelines found in the Practice Guide. This section also uses visual representations to make the mapping easy to understand. We began \\nby identifying the six security characteristics from the Practice Guide and representing them as \\nhexagons in a heat map. The color of each hexagon represents the degree of overlap between the \\nAustralian document and the Practice Guide. In the ISM mapping, green denotes that the \\nPractice Guide security characteristic was mapped",

On-Demand Assessment of Air Traffic Impact of Blocking \\nAirspace Amal Srivastava, Tom St. Clair, Grant Pan\\nThe MITRE Corporation 7515 Colshire Ave\\nMcLean, VA, USA Abstract The Federal Aviation Administration often blocks strategically located airspace volumes to \\nensure safety during a variety of operations that are potentially hazardous to aircraft, such \\nas space launches. As the frequency of these operations increases, there is a growing need \\nto deepen collaboration and transparency between stakeholders regarding the use of \\nairspace. This collaboration can be supported by models and capabilities to quickly assess \\nthe impact of airspace closures, up to 12 months into the future. This paper presents a \\ntechnique to enable a what-if analysis capability coupled with a prediction model, \\nwhereby changes in airspace dimension, location, and activation time are reflected \\ninstantaneously as measures of projected impact. The technique can also be used for quick \\npost-operations analysis using historical traffic data and to develop air traffic impact \\nassessment capabilities accessible to a broad range of users outside of the air traffic \\ndomain. This research has three key components: developing a model to predict air traffic \\ndemand, modeling air traffic impact to the affected traffic, and reducing this information \\ninto a data structure that can support on-demand analysis. The focus of this paper is on new \\ntechniques to predict demand using a large set of historical track data and further encode \\nthese projections to support the quick assessment of the impact of blocking various \\nairspace volumes. Initial results show that the proposed data reduction scheme accurately \\nrepresented the traffic crossing an airspace and resulted in data size reduction by over \\n50%. The projection model performed well, the actual number of impacted flights were \\nwithin the estimated range approximately 80% of the time. Finally, the responsiveness of \\nthe web-based prototype developed to illustrate the concept demonstrated the models \\nability to support an on-demand assessment of the air traffic impact of blocking airspace. 2018 Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved. 2 IntroductionI. Demand for airspace access has been on the rise due to an increasing number of new \\nentrants such as space operators, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), and balloon operators. \\nTo manage operations that are potentially hazardous to aircraft, such as space launches in \\nthe National Airspace System (NAS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) may route \\nair traffic around strategically located blocked airspace to ensure operational safety. As the \\nfrequency of these activities increases, there is a growing need to increase collaboration \\nand transparency among stakeholders regarding airspace usage. A primary need to support \\nthis collaboration is the ability of all stakeholders to quickly assess the impact of planned \\noperations far in advance of the event, up to 12 months into the future. Different \\nstakeholders will have different uses for such a capability. A space operator may be able to \\nadjust the plan of launch and reentry operations to have minimal impact to the NAS, and an \\nFAA analyst may be able to quickly assess the impact of last-minute changes in the launch \\ntime. In fact, a prediction model coupled with a what-if analysis capability, in which \\nchanges in blocked airspace dimensions, location, and activation time are reflected \\ninstantaneously as a measure of projected impact, could be a key enabler of collaborative \\nand transparent airspace use among all stakeholders. This work has three key components: developing a model to predict air traffic impacted by \\nblocking airspace volumes, modeling air traffic impact on the affected traffic, and reducing \\nthis information to a data structure that can support on-demand analysis. The focus of this \\npaper is on new techniques to predict demand from a large set of historical track data and \\nfurther encode these projections into a data structure that can support the quick \\nassessment using a what-if analysis paradigm. The organization of this paper is as follows: Section II explores background on existing \\napproaches to predicting the air traffic impact of blocked airspace, Section III provides an \\noverview of the approach, and Section IV discusses the data sources underpinning the \\nimplemented algorithms and the scope of the study. Section V discusses the data reduction \\nand encoding scheme, Section VI describes the traffic projection model, and Section VII \\nsummarizes notes on the implementation of the model as a prototype. In conclusion, \\nSection VIII points out the strengths and weakness of this approach and future work. In this paper, the terms aircraft hazard areas (AHAs) and Special Use Areas (SUAs) are \\ncollectively referred to as blocked airspace; additionally, use of word the airspace \\nimplies airspace volumes having lateral as well as vertical dimensions. II. Background The primary focus of the research presented in this paper is enabling a what-if analysis \\ncapability that can provide immediate assessment of the impact of blocking airspace to a \\nbroad class of users with little expertise in the air traffic domain. To the best knowledge of 3 1 DART is a product of AvMet, information at http://www.avmet.com/dart\\n2 Fast-time simulation tool developed by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames. 3 Fast-time simulation tool developed by The MITRE Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD). the authors, no published research addresses this requirement. Tools such as Dynamic \\nAirspace Routing Tool (DART) 1can be used to assess the NAS impact of closing airspaces; \\nhowever, to do that requires access to the tool, operator knowledge of the air traffic \\ndomain, availability of data (such as traffic and weather), and setup time. The other component of the research is projecting the air traffic impact of blocking an \\narbitrary airspace, which is a complex task, as it varies significantly depending on factors \\nsuch as location, season, day of the week, time of day, and weather. In addition, the air \\ntraffic management strategies to avoid hazard areas vary depending on area control centers \\nand are not known in advance of the operation that requires blocking airspace. There are several publicly available demand forecasts. FAA publishes the Terminal Area \\nForecast (TAF) for active airports in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems \\n(NPIAS), which is considered the de facto official aviation forecast. It is developed from a \\nseries of airport models that use trends in demographics to forecast changes in \\nenplanement. Boeing publishes its latest assessment of the 20-year demand for world travel \\nin its Current Market Outlook (Boeing, 2017), and Airbus provides its projection of 20-year \\ndemand in its Global Market Forecast (Airbus, 2017). Finally, the Transportation Systems \\nAnalysis Model (TSAM) (Jeff Viken, 2006; Jeff Viken, 2006) developed by Virginia Techs Air \\nTransportation Systems Lab and NASA Langley can be used to project the passenger \\ndemand for trips more than 100 miles selecting among three modes of transport: \\nautomobile, airline, and on-demand services using very light jet aircraft. All these forecasts \\nfocus on demand growth at the airports, not in the airspace in between; that is, they do not \\nprovide a prediction of trajectories of fights between the origin and destination airports. \\nThis makes them insufficient for modeling the impact of blocked airspace. \\nOne approach to assessing the impact of a launch or reentry operation is to model the traffic \\non the launch day based on available traffic and weather forecasts, and calculate the \\nexpected delay by simulating the rerouting of the affected flights around the AHAs using \\ntools such as Future ATM Concepts Evaluation Tool (FACET)2 and systemwideModeler 3. \\nThis approach requires significant effort from a well-informed operator in setting up the \\nsimulation to realistically model the planned operation conditions, making it unsuitable for \\nuse in a what-if analysis capability that can be used by a broad range of users with no \\nknowledge of the air traffic domain. Another approach used by Jessica Lee and Marie Kee (Kee, January, 2014) involves \\nstatistical analysis on a specific SpaceX Falcon9 launch vehicle/Dragon capsule reentry \\nvehicle operation to determine if the operation caused flights to experience significantly \\nlonger flight distances, more fuel burned, and longer flight durations as compared to similar \\nflights on other days. The paths of the flights on the launch day were compared to the \\nsimilar flights on a set of five historical days to arrive at a range of distance and time \\nimpacts of the launch. This approach may be used to develop prediction models of the \\nlaunches with similar characteristics, such as the location and geometry of the hazard areas, 4 block time window, and the day of the week of the operation. However, its use as a general-\\npurpose method to assess the impact of any blocked airspace is limited. Since this approach \\nis derived from a comparison to actual impacts, a large number of historical impacted days would \\nbe required before such an approach can be used to estimate behavior for future events. Also, the \\nstudy required significant human effort and is not amenable to automation and producing \\nresults in a short time. In related research, Srivastava (Amal Srivastava, 2015) projected the NAS impact of \\nblocking airspace by measuring",
