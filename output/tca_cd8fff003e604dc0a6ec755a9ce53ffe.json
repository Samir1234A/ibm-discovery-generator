  "text": "Monitoring Tool Recommendations After experiencing the Lateral Deviation scenarios, the number of TRACON controllers that felt lxxxviii\\n the Lateral Boundaries should always be displayed increased by 10-20%. The majority of \\ncontrollers felt the Inner Boundary should always be displayed (80%) and the Outer Boundary \\nshould always be displayed (70%). The rest felt the boundaries should be user toggleable. There \\nwere no instances of Not Needed. For the two features related to the Exceedance Warning, all (100%) TRACON controllers thought \\nthe red LAT in the data block should always be displayed. A majority (90%) thought the \\nBoundary Line Color Change to Red should always occur; however, one controller thought that \\nit was not needed/should be user toggleable. In the comments, two controllers recommended that for an Exceedance Warning, the entire \\ndata block of the deviating aircraft should turn red. Controllers also made the following \\ncomments with respect to the Lateral Boundaries: (NCT) Lateral bounds not needed when monitoring from standard scope display since \\nthey are so hard to see inside them.\\n(Non-NCT TRACON) Lateral bounds work great on 4:1 aspect ratio, but clutter final when \\non regular aspect. IM Clearance Completion6.5.6.2\\nAt the end of Day 2 (QT3), after experiencing all nominal scenarios, controllers were asked a \\nsimilar question: what combination of tools would you recommend to help the Final controller \\ncomplete the IM Clearance? Participants selected [Always On / User Toggleable / Not Needed] \\nfor each element. Figure 5-71 shows the number of participant responses for each type of recommendation for \\neach IM PA Tool and display feature for the IM PA Final controller. The left column for each \\nelement consists of TRACON controller responses and the right column is the Tower controller \\nresponses. One participant selected both User Toggleable and Not Needed for several elements; \\nthis is therefore shown as a separate category. The WSL Line was not included as it never \\napplied in Final controller airspace. lxxxix\\n Figure 5-71. IM Clearance Completion Tool Recommendations Note: The Week 1 controller questionnaires inadvertently omitted the IM PA Spacing Goal and Lead Aircraft Call Sign features. \\nTherefore, only eight responses are shown for these features instead of twelve. All (100%) TRACON controller participants responded that the CSL Line should always be on. A \\nmajority (70%) of responses suggested that the WSL-P should either always be on or be user \\ntoggleable. A majority (80%) responded that the Predictive and Caution Alerts should always be \\non and the others responded that it should be user toggleable. All (100%) TRACON controllers responded that the IM PA Spacing Goal and Lead Aircraft Call \\nSign should always be on. A majority (80%) responded that the Lead Aircraft Runway should \\neither always be on or be user toggleable. A majority (70%) responded that IM Status (in the \\nSpacing List) should either always be on or be user toggleable. This was higher than the \\nresponses to the IM Lead and IM Trail Aircraft Status indicators in the data blocks. Only a \\nminority of controllers responded that the Distance to the CSL (30%) and WSL W (40%) should \\nbe user toggleable. The rest responded that they were not needed. A majority (60%) of responses suggested that the Inner and Outer Lateral Bounds should either \\nalways be on or be user toggleable. These features are discussed further in Section 5.6. \\nResponses were more variable regarding the necessity of the other elements. --------------------------------- At the end of Day 2 (QT3), controllers were also asked if the usefulness of any of the tools \\ndepend on whether there was single monitor for both approaches, or separate monitors for \\neach approach? All participants (n=12) answered No. xc\\n Other IM PA Tool Comments6.5.7\\nThe following is a collection of other selected comments made by the controller participants \\nwith respect to the IM PA Tools. Given their specific experience in the areas being simulated, \\nNCT responses are specifically identified. Non-NCT TRACON and Tower responses are thus also \\nindividually identified. (NCT) I relied on the IM PA automation and trusted it, but could not verify because the \\naircraft were already much closer than standard separation.\\n(Non-NCT TRACON) I think the best experience was with all tools available turned on. \\nWith select tools off, the scenarios were still easily workable, but the extra tools provide \\ngood trend data and overall improved awareness.\\n(Non-NCT TRACON) The WSL did advise when I need to terminate an approach but did \\nnot provide a good advance notice.\\n(Non-NCT TRACON) Situational awareness may be increased even more if the gray line \\n[WSL-P] was there the whole time.\\n(Non-NCT TRACON) Third line and wake preview lines are better than without. Not \\nhaving the gray wake line hinders overall awareness. [WSL-P Only] I think I still had \\nenough awareness but the numbers not being in the data block takes away a measure of \\nawareness.\\n(Non-NCT TRACON) Distance processing on CSL and WSL in data block not necessary for \\ntrailing aircraft unless it goes into alert status.\\n(NCT) The CSL data turning color really caught my attention better than the line turning \\ncolor. Dont care to have either on but they should pop up when it goes into an alert \\nstatus. \\n(NCT) The CSL line isn't that helpful but the data block changing color is more helpful and \\nnoticeable.\\n(TRACON/NCT) Spacing list should show all aircraft not just who can play, put (non-pair \\nwith aircraft on 28R final) this will allow controller to know right away instead of \\nsearching for aircraft pair that they don't have. Results Topic 5: Lateral Deviations6.6\\nAs described in Sections 4.5.4 and 4.5.6.6, a portion of the evaluation on Day 3 involved \\nintroducing lateral deviations to examine the acceptability of the monitoring configurations and \\neffectiveness of the IM PA Tools in these rare, off-nominal conditions. This included determining \\nto what degree will controllers want to detect developing deviations before a Lateral Boundary \\nis crossed, whether a 4:1 aspect ratio display is needed, especially with only an Exceedance \\nWarning (no Lateral Predictive Alert) with a tighter Lateral Boundary size (ILS versus 500 ft). All \\nof the IM PA-related tools described previously were available to the Monitor controllers for \\nthese scenarios. The Final controller position was not evaluated for these conditions and unless \\notherwise noted, the results in this section are in response to the Lateral Deviation scenarios \\nonly. xci\\n Workload Acceptability6.6.1\\nAt the end of each Lateral Deviation scenario (QT6), controllers were asked if their workload \\nwas acceptable in the scenario they just experienced. Their responses were examined with \\nrespect to monitor configuration and display type. Response Means and Standard Deviations \\nare summarized in Table 5-60. Scale responses are shown in Figure 5-72. Some rows indicate \\nn=9 and n=8 because not all Week 1 controllers experienced all scenarios (see Section 4.5.6.6). Table 5-60. Controller Responses to Acceptability of Overall Workload (Lateral Deviation Scenarios) Display Type STARS FMA\\nCombined 28L/28R Monitor Sample Size (n) 10 10 Mean (M) 88.6 91.6 Standard Deviation (SD) 18.2 12.4 28R Monitor\\nSample Size (n) 9 9 Mean (M) 94.4 90.3 Standard Deviation (SD) 4.9 13.3 28L Monitor\\nSample Size (n) 8 8 Mean (M) 95.8 95.0 Standard Deviation (SD) 5.1 6.1 xcii\\n Figure 5-72. My overall workload was acceptable for the scenario I just experienced. (Lateral Deviation \\nScenarios) Note: o indicates the Tower controller responses for reference. These are not included in the M and SD computations. Some rows \\nindicate n=9 and n=8 because not all Week 1 controllers experienced all of the Lateral Deviation scenarios. All (100%) TRACON controllers agreed their workload was acceptable across all display types \\nand monitor configurations, except for one. This controller disagreed for the Combined Monitor \\nconfiguration with the STARS display and commented Breaking out a 28L aircraft blundering \\nright requires two simultaneous transmissions. Despite this, no practical difference in workload \\nacceptability was observed among any of the display type and monitor configurations. Other selected open-ended comments for this question included: (NCT / 28R/FMA) Two blundering at once was work intensive.\\n(Non-NCT TRACON / 28R/FMA) Multiple alerts simultaneously make it impossible to talk \\nto all involved aircraft in a timely manner. Separation Assessment6.6.2\\nAt the end of each Lateral Deviation scenario (QT6), controllers were asked if they were \\nconfident that I could assess whether separation would be maintained between the IM Trail \\nAircraft and their Lead aircraft in the scenario they just experienced. Their responses were \\nexamined with respect to monitor configuration and display type. Response Means and \\nStandard Deviations are summarized in Table 5-61. Scale responses are shown in Figure 5-73. \\nSome rows indicate n=9 and n=8 because not all Week 1 controllers experienced all scenarios \\n(see Section 4.5.6.6). Table 5-61. Controller Responses to Separation Assessment (Lateral Deviation Scenarios) Display Type STARS FMA\\nCombined 28L/28R Monitor Sample Size (n) 10 10 Mean (M) 90.5 91.3 Standard Deviation (SD) 6.9 10.6 28R Monitor\\nSample Size (n) 9 9 Mean (M) 89.3 93.6 Standard Deviation (SD) 14.0 6.7 28L Monitor\\nSample Size (n) 8 8 Mean (M) 91.3 93.9 xciii\\n Standard Deviation (SD) 7.9 6.3 Figure 5-73. I was confident that I could assess whether separation would be maintained between the \\nIM Trail Aircraft and their Lead aircraft. (Lateral Deviation Scenarios) Note:",
