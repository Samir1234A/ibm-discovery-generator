Billed stopping The instance is preparing to be stopped or stop-hibernated. Not billed if preparing to stop Billed if preparing to hibernate stopped The instance is shut down and cannot be used. The instance can be restarted at any time. Not billed shutting-down The instance is preparing to be terminated. Not billed terminated The instance has been permanently deleted and cannot be restarted. Not billed Note: Reserved Instances that applied to terminated instances are billed until the end of their term according to their payment option. See Section 6.2.3 for a discussion of how stopping and re-starting instances would be implemented on the example DevSevOps account. 3.6 Tagging A tag is a label which contains custom metadata that either the user or AWS assigns to an AWS resource. Each tag consists of a key and value pair, where each key can have one or multiple values. Each resource can have up to 50 user-applied tags, such as [createdBy = employee90440]. Tagging resources is an essential component of effective cost management in the cloud since it enables administrators to streamline resource management, access management, and cost allocation by allowing for detailed cost tracking. Tagging gives direct accountability and visibility into IT costs by team and application. Cost allocation tags are an optional form of tagging that can be activated in the Billing & Cost Management Dashboard. After cost allocation tags have been activated, AWS uses the tags to organize resources in a cost allocation report so one can understand the cause and quantity of charges associated with each resource. For example, if you tag resources with an application name, you can track the total cost of a single application. This would allow the system administrators to directly track costs of different applications and use that information to drive future decisions. You can also use tags to filter views in Cost Explorer for further insight into system costs. 17 3.7 AWS Config AWS Config is a service which provides a detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in your AWS account. When enabled, Config discovers resources that exist in your account, records their current configuration, and captures any changes to these configurations. This includes how the resources are related to one another and how they were configured in the past, which enables administrators to understand how configurations and relationships change over time. This ability provides numerous benefits including continuous assessment, change management, compliance monitoring, operational troubleshooting, and cost understanding. To effectively manage costs in the cloud, cloud administrators must understand exactly what is running in the cloud and for what purpose. Although this concept may appear obvious, it is often overlooked in cloud deployments as it is fundamentally different from on premise datacenter deployments where infrastructure costs are fixed, making resource evaluation less critical. Monitoring resources with methods such as Tagging and AWS Config reduces the likelihood of misallocated resources and inefficient architectures. 3.8 AWS Organizations Organizations or applications that use multiple AWS accounts to fulfill their IT needs may choose to enroll in AWS Organizations at no additional cost. AWS Organizations provides central governance and management across multiple AWS accounts. It allows you to create groups of accounts, apply policies for governance, automate account creation, and consolidate billing. Amazon offers volume discounts for services purchased in large quantities. Most of the common services such as EC2 and S3 have volume pricing tiers across certain usage dimensions that provides lower prices the more one uses the service. Below is an example of the volume discounts offered for S3. S3 Standard Storage Pricing First 50 TB / Month $0.023 per GB Next 250 TB / Month $0.022 per GB Over 500 TB / Month $0.021 per GB Enabling AWS Organizations will allow organizations with multiple accounts to take advantage of the discount volume pricing. For billing purposes, AWS treats all the accounts in the organization as if they were one account, combing the usage from all accounts to determine which volume pricing tiers apply. In addition to volume discounts, AWS Organizations also allows for consolidated billing with a unified billing dashboard which shows a view of charges incurred by all accounts. Enrolling multiple GovCloud accounts in AWS Organizations would reduce current and future costs as the system expands in production, as it has the potential to reduce programmatic costs through volume discounts. Additionally, it will provide administrators more insight into incurred costs through the consolidated billing dashboards and reports. AWS Organizations was deployed 18 on GovCloud in April of 2019 and should be incorporated into most programs GovCloud strategy. 3.9 EC2 Right Sizing Right sizing is a key mechanism for optimizing costs on AWS, but is often ignored when migrating or developing systems in the cloud. Right sizing is the process of matching instance types and size to workload demands and capacity requirements in order to minimize costs. Right sizing also includes the process of monitoring existing instances and identifying opportunities to eliminate or downsize without compromising reliability and other requirements. Historically, IT systems were provisioned to be able to accommodate traffic during peak hours. This approach is not optimized for the cloud and should not be used when deploying instances in GovCloud. To minimize costs, instances should take advantage of the elasticity offered by cloud environments and should be provisioned based on average usage rather than peak usage with supplemental tools such as auto-scaling to ensure appropriate performance during peak hours. The first step to right sizing is to monitor and analyze the current use of existing services and infrastructure to gain insight into performance and usage patterns. When monitoring instances, the most important hardware considerations to monitor are CPU, Memory, Network, and Storage including disk read/write operations. These metrics should be collected and analyzed to determine not only the most appropriate EC2 size, but also instance family (General Purpose, Compute Optimized, Memory Optimized, Storage Optimized, Accelerated Compute). Amazon recommends that instances with a maximum CPU usage and memory usage of less than 40% over a four-week period are candidates for downsizing to smaller instances. As a general rule of thumb, they recommend EC2 instances which meet this threshold can safely be cut in half. For example, a c4.8xlarge which uses less than 40% of available CPU over a 4 week period, can be moved to a c4.4xlarge which would save approximately $570 every month. 19 Cost Optimization Cost Management Tools \\nAWS services have a complex costing model resulting due to the clouds abilities to scale based on resource utilization. This allows users to quickly adjust services and save money based on utilization. By consistently monitoring system infrastructure and reacting to changes as they occur, an IT system can work efficiently while maintaining low costs. To help the PMO take advantage of this structure, Amazon offers tools that monitor utilization, set thresholds, and provide detailed cost breakdowns. By understanding cloud cost management and utilizing Amazons cost management tools, the government program can effectively scale resources while maintaining system security and performance, ultimately resulting in significant cost savings. 4.1 AWS Billing and Cost Management For many government programs, different AWS accounts will be used with different root users, users, access, and AWS services. AWS Consolidated Billing can be used to aggregate the billing of services across multiple accounts for the purposes of cost savings and centralized cost management. To utilize this feature, AWS Organizations should be used as an account management service so that one master account can pay the charges across member accounts. Each GovCloud account must map to a commercial account, and those commercial accounts must be part of one single master commercial organization through the Organizations service. The master commercial account can view resource usage and activity information for all the AWS GovCloud accounts in the AWS Management Console. This master commercial account is also the account to which all charges will be billed for both commercial and GovCloud, which enables the PMO to reap the cost saving and management benefits of consolidated billing. 4.2 AWS Cost Explorer AWS Cost Explorer helps one track spending via default or custom reports which are accessible via console or API. For example, one can see which services, accounts, or regions are most expensive and quickly analyze on ones resources, such as the utilization of EC2 instances. One can also get more in-depth guidance such as forecasting, resource optimization, and Reserved Instance purchase recommendations. The cost per request is $0.01, which can be generated hourly and/or daily. 4.3 AWS Trusted Advisor AWS Trusted Advisor scans ones AWS environment and recommends improvements specific to ones architecture. Without signing up or paying for the service, all AWS customers are entitled to seven core Trusted Adviser checks which focus on permissions, EBS and RDS public snapshots, and service limits. These checks are accessible through dashboards in the console or via API and can",
