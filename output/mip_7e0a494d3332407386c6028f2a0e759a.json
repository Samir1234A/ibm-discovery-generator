  "text": "(i.e., from nine to 18). Four TOST comparisons were conducted, one for each set across the two measures (i.e., post-\\nscenario questions). None of the tests revealed statistically equivalent results. This suggests\\ndifferent uses of the tool sets between the roles, which resulted in different perceptions. In this\\ninstance, pilot role was treated as another independent variable. Therefore, two 2 x 2 Mixed\\nANOVAs were conducted for the tool sets and pilot role across the two measures. The tests did\\nnot reveal any statistically significant results. 4.1.3.4 Hypothesis 4: Controllers Will Find the New Display Elements for IM Useful as\\nCompared to Only the Basic The forth hypothesis addressed if controllers found the new display elements for IM useful\\ncompared to the basic tool set. Two post-scenario questions were developed to address this\\nhypothesis: 1) I was confident that the spacing of the [IM] aircraft would remain outside my\\nseparation requirement, and 2) I had the necessary display elements for conducting IM\\noperations. A 3 x 2 Repeated Measures ANOVA was conducted for controller role (i.e., feeder\\nand final) and IM tool set (i.e., basic, basic+ cue, and basic+ cue and prediction) across each of\\nthe two dependent measures. This was done in lieu of one MANOVA due to the previously-\\ndescribed unfavorable correlations between dependent measures. There were no main effects\\nor interactions for both Repeated Measures ANOVAs. 4-10 4.1.4 Summary Data\\nOne hundred thirty participant controller runs and 108 participant flight crew runs were\\nplanned. Due to technical issues with the simulation environment, three controller IM TRACON\\ninitiation runs were excluded from data analysis, which also resulted in the loss of six\\nparticipant flight crew runs. An additional 11 participant flight crew runs (that did not affect the\\noverall controller runs) were excluded due to technical issues with the simulation environment.\\nTable 4-3 shows the number of runs for both controllers and participant flight crews by scenario\\ntype. Table 4-4 shows the number of aircraft per environment. Table 4-3.

For IM\\nTRACON initiation scenarios, 1203 total IM operations were proposed to the controllers. Of\\nthose, 2.7% (33 of 1203) IM proposals were rejected by the controllers and 1170 IM operations\\nwere issued. Of those, 1.6% (19) were not engaged due to the pseudo-pilot not properly\\nengaging the operation or simulation technical issues7. Therefore, a total of 1151 (95.6%) IM\\noperations were properly engaged and initiated. For the en route initiation scenarios, 306 IM\\noperations were conducted. Table 4-5 summarizes the number of IM proposals, clearances, and\\ninitiations. Table 4-6 summarizes the IM operations by IM initiation point and clearance type.\\nTable 4-7 summarizes the IM operations by controller tool set and clearance type. While there\\nare different totals for the different clearance types and for the three controller tool set\\noptions, it is not believed to impact any feedback / results as both were frequently experienced. 7 These aircraft flew the RNAV profile instead of IM. 4-11 Table 4-5.

They preferred to shortcut the route and / or tighten the\\nspacing between aircraft (which was the reason for most vectoring). However, this did not\\nalways lead to a better traffic situation, and sometime led to spacing issues. 8 Large intervals were due to the initial sequence and spacing of arrival aircraft. The TBFM/TSAS schedule does not\\ncontain logic to speed an aircraft up above the profile speed to close a naturally occurring large gap. 4-12 4.2 Terminal Metering Only Operations (Baseline)\\nThe baseline condition for the controllers was terminal metering operations without IM. The\\npost-scenario results are presented in this section. The majority of controllers agreed with all\\nstatements regardless of role (Figure 4-7). Figure 4-7. Controller Responses to Post-Scenario Statements on the Baseline Condition\\nwithout IM 4-13 In the post-scenario questionnaire, controllers were asked to rate their average overall\\nworkload during the baseline on the Bedford Workload Rating Scale. The majority of controllers\\nfound workload to be acceptable for both roles (Figure 4-8). Figure 4-8. Controller Responses to the Bedford Workload Rating for the Baseline In the post-scenario questionnaire, controllers were asked to rate their acceptability of the\\nbaseline with Controller Acceptance Rating Scale. The majority of controllers found IM\\noperationally acceptable across the tool sets (Figure 4-9). Finally, there was one condition\\nwhere an aircraft pairs spacing was below the applicable separation standard that occurred for\\nunknown reasons and was not analyzed further. Figure 4-9. Controller Responses for Controller Acceptance Rating Scale for the Baseline 4.3 Integrated Ground Operations\\nWhile the focus of the simulation was the integration of IM into the terminal metering\\nenvironment, it was desirable to understand all three operations that were new to the\\ncontrollers: terminal metering, RNP RF turn operations, and IM. Therefore, controllers were\\nasked to rank the three operations relative to one another from the most to least challenging.\\nFigure 4-10 shows each operation and how often each appeared in each category. Figure 4-11 4-14 shows each operation and the relative ranking. RNP RF turns operations had the fewest least\\nchallenging rankings and appears to be the most challenging operation. Terminal metering had\\nthe fewest most challenging rankings. IM ranked between RNP RF turn and metering\\ncomplexity. Figure 4-10. Controller Ranking of Operations. Frequency by Category Figure 4-11. Controller Average Ranking of Operations Relative to One Another 4-15 Controllers were asked whether IM was compatible with terminal metering operations. The\\nmajority (8/9; 89%) agreed (M=69.9; SD=22.1) (Figure 4-12). Figure 4-12. Controller Responses to IM is compatible with terminal metering operations 4.4 IM Operations Conduct\\nThis section covers controller actions based on an IM clearance proposal as well as controller\\nand participant flight crew actions related to IM once active. 4.4.1 IM Initiation\\nAs described previously, a total of 1203 IM clearances were presented / proposed to\\ncontrollers. Of the 1203 proposals, 97.2% (1170 of 1203) were initiated by controllers. Of\\ninitiated IM aircraft, 76.4% (894 of 1170) were achieve-by then maintain operations and 23.5%\\n(276 of 1170) were capture then maintain operations. Table 4-8 shows the distribution of IM\\ninitiations by IM operation and condition. Table 4-8. Frequency of IM Initiations as a Percentage of the Sample Controller tool set (n = IM clearance type Both\\nachieve-by Capture then\\nmaintain Combined Basic 76.2 23.8 32.0\\nBasic+ cue 76.0 24.0 35.2\\nBasic+ cue and prediction 77.1 22.9 32.8\\nCombined 76.4 23.6 100 Of the 1203 IM clearance proposals presented to the controller, thirty-three were rejected by\\nthe controller entering the keyboard command. Of the 33 rejections, thirty (2.5% of all\\ninitiations presented and 3.3% of all achieve-by clearances) were one of the achieve-by\\nclearance type options and three (0.2% of all initiations presented and 1.0% of all capture then\\nmaintain clearances) were capture then maintain (Table 4-9). On average, controllers rejected\\nIM clearances 116.7 sec (SD=132.6; Range= 20 703 seconds) after they were proposed. One\\ncontroller accounted for 19 (58%) of the rejections. 4-16 Table 4-9.

After excluding rejections, a total of 1170 IM operations were initiated by the controllers by\\nentering the keyboard command. On average, controllers entered the keyboard command 30.6\\nseconds (SD=28.8) after an IM operation was proposed / displayed. Table 4-10 shows IM\\ninitiation delay by scenario and condition. Controllers were on average 11 seconds faster\\ninitiating IM for capture then maintain clearances (M=25.3; SD=22.7), as compared to both\\nachieve-by clearance type options (M=35.9; SD=36.2). Initiation delay across the controller tool\\nset were similar but the basic+ cue and prediction tool set was 4.3 seconds faster than the basic\\ntool set. Table 4-10.
