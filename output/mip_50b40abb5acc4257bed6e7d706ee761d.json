The calculator shows Performance Management service levels, activities, and roles for the full software development lifecycle (SDLC). Table of Contents 1. INTRODUCTION \\n Characterizations of three Performance Management areas: Performance Engineering (PE), Capacity Planning (CP), and Performance Operations (PO) Development of the following for the three Performance Management areas across the SDLC: \\n Service levels Activities Organizational roles and responsibilities Integration points 1 2 The authors affiliation with The MITRE Corporation is provided for identification purposes only, and is not intended to convey or imply MITRE's concurrence with, or support for, the positions, opinions or viewpoints expressed by the author. In testing, it was found that recommended activities were being done in the later life cycle stages, but there was a lack of emphasis on planning and budgeting and on requirements gathering for performance and capacity. This confirmed a lack of Performance Management activities early in the SDLC. 2. Performance Management Definition Performance Management can be considered as a set of activities within Capacity Management, one of the processes found in the Service Design phase of the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) V3 service delivery lifecycle. Capacity Managements goal is to ensure that cost-justifiable capacity in all areas of IT always exists and is matched to the current and future agreed needs of the business, in a timely manner. Capacity Management is not a one-time design activity, but an ongoing process that looks at the entire IT environment throughout the service delivery lifecycle and has both proactive and reactive elements. Capacity Management also works with the ITIL V3 Service Level Management process to ensure that service level targets for new services are reasonable considering capacity constraints. Performance Management begins in the design of a new or changed service and includes planning of hardware, software, staffing, and processes to ensure successful deployment. Performance Management fits within the proactive element of Capacity Management by predicting future needs, developing capacity solutions, and engaging with service level management to ensure achievable performance targets. Reactive elements of Performance Management occur post-deployment. They include monitoring and responding to threshold alerts, assisting the service desk in resolving incidents, and conducting capacity-related root cause analyses. Performance Management begins with an understanding of business demands and performance targets, as well as current capacity, performance, and technology limitations. Only after methodical performance and capacity modeling has yielded capacity requirements should procurement of resources begin. This ensures that acquisitions are defendable, and it increases the likelihood of selecting the best solution considering total cost of ownership and scalability. 2.1 Performance Management Areas The three Performance Management areas have the same concerns, but each has a different focus, so each has different activities. Together, the Performance Management areas focus on continuous evolution and improvement of systems. Each area informs the others, as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Performance Management Lifecycle The three Performance Management areas are: Performance Engineering (PE) The focus of Performance Engineering is to maximize performance in the design \\nof an application, given defined service levels (e.g., availability, response time), system capacity (e.g., processor, Capacity Planning (CP) Focus: Resources \\n Given Design \\n Given Service Levels \\n Given Workload Performance Operations (PO) Focus: Service Levels \\n Given Design \\n Given Resources \\n Given Workload Performance Engineering (PE) Focus: Design \\n Given Service Levels \\n Given Resources \\n Given Workload memory, storage, network bandwidth), and workload size (e.g., transactions, users). Performance Engineering occurs in the early part of the lifecycle, concluding with the testing phase. Capacity Planning (CP) The focus of Capacity Planning is to optimize system capacity (e.g., processor, memory, \\nstorage, network bandwidth), given the design of the application, defined service levels (e.g., availability, response time), and workload size (e.g., transactions, users). Capacity Planning efforts occur primarily in the middle part of the lifecycle, based on testing phase results. Performance Operations (PO) The focus of Performance Operations is to manage the operational system \\n(hardware, operating system, system software, application) to defined service levels (e.g., availability, response time), given the implemented system capacity (e.g., processor, memory, storage, network bandwidth), the design of the application, and workload size (e.g., transactions, users). Performance Operations efforts occur primarily in the latter part of the lifecycle, after application deployment. 3. Development of Performance Management Program To support rapid decision making on which Performance Management activities should be conducted for applications, a standard program has been developed based on standard SDLC activities, lead organizations, scenarios for different categories of applications, service levels, and service level criteria. 3.1 Activities and Service Levels The following steps can be used in developing a Performance Management program for an application: Assign appropriate organizational SDLC activities to each of the Performance Management areas. \\n Assign a lead organization for each activity. \\n Using the following definitions of major service levels, determine whether each activity should be performed based on the service level: Gold (G) top level of service Silver (S) average level of service Bronze (B) lowest level of service Table 1 shows example activities, SDLC phases, minimum service levels, and lead organizations. SDLC Phases are defined as: Phase 0 Vision \\n Phase 1 Planning \\n Phase 2 Requirements \\n Phase 3 Design \\n Phase 4 Develop / Test \\n Phase 5 Deploy / O&M (Operations and Maintenance) As examples: PE activity 3 should be done for all service levels (gold, silver, and bronze), because it is defined for the bronze \\n(B) level PE activity 6 is only required for the gold (G) level \\n CP activity 1 should be done for the silver and gold levels (S) Table 1: Example Performance Management Activities, Service Levels, and Organizations 3.2 Scenarios Scenarios of different applications have been developed to show activities across the SDLC lifecycle for each Performance Management area. Table 2 shows sample scenario definitions, including initial evaluations of service levels. Table 2: Scenario Definitions 4. Service Level and Activities Calculator A spreadsheet has been developed (available on request) that implements the above defined Performance Management program. The following sections show the data entry and calculations in the calculator (specific instructions are in the spreadsheet). The overall process is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: Performance Management Calculator Process The calculator uses entered application information and ratings against defined criteria to determine Performance Management service levels and activities for the application. Calculated activities can then be compared to the applications project plan to ensure the appropriate Performance Management activities are in the plan to cost effectively minimize risk of performance or capacity issues. 4.1 Criteria, Metrics, System Information, and Service Rating Criteria to be used to determine service levels are defined for each of the Performance Management areas, along with service metrics for high (5), medium (3), or low (1) values. The spreadsheet criteria and activities can be customized for each organizations priorities. System information is entered and ratings are entered based on the service metrics definitions. Table 3 shows example criteria for the three Performance Management area, along with entered system information and rating.
