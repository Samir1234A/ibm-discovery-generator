  "sdl_extracted_summary": "responses. The majority (80%) of TRACON controllers agreed (M=76.5; SD=19.8) that they were \\ncomfortable allowing an IM Trail Aircraft to manage its own speed to achieve the desired \\nspacing goal at the FAF. Two controllers neither agreed nor disagreed. From the open-ended comments, at least three of the lower ratings appeared to be a result of \\ncontrollers not being allowed to manually keep the IM Trail Aircraft between the limits when it \\nbecame apparent that a Caution Alert was imminent. xii\\n Traffic Awareness6.2.4\\nAt the end of Day 1 and Day 2, controllers were asked about the acceptability of their overall \\nlevel of traffic awareness with respect to the IM Lead Aircraft, IM Trail Aircraft, and Other \\nAircraft. Their responses were examined with respect to monitor configuration. Response \\nMeans and Standard Deviations are summarized in Table 5-6. Scale responses are shown in \\nFigure 5-7. Only Week 2-3 TRACON controller responses were included in the analysis. Table 5-6.

These are not included in the M and SD computations. All Week 2-3 TRACON controllers agreed their overall level of traffic awareness was acceptable \\nwith respect to all aircraft types for both monitor configurations, except for Separate Monitors / \\nOther Aircraft. In this case, the one participant that disagreed noted in the open-ended \\ncomments: Difficult to determine distance between successive lead aircraft. This participant \\nhas TRACON experience, though is currently assigned to a Tower position. This may help explain \\nthe lower rating. The overall results do not suggest any apparent differences in acceptability by monitor \\nconfiguration among aircraft types. However, Lead Aircraft response variability for the IM Lead \\nAircraft appeared to be lower for the Separate Monitor configuration than for all the other \\ncases. Other open-ended comments for this question included: (Non-NCT TRACON / Separate): Trails do not need to be monitored as closely because \\nthere is automation to ensure separation. Focus can be spent elsewhere.\\n(Non-NCT TRACON / Combined): Definitely was more aware of the trail aircraft because \\nof the new procedures. But spacing required more attention to the lead aircraft \\nfollowing other pairs.\\n(Non-NCT TRACON / Combined): As the day went on, I focused more on distance \\nbetween pairs as opposed to the aircraft in the PA. This was easy because of the alerts \\nand warnings. Separation6.2.5\\nThis section summarizes the subjective questionnaire data with respect to controller confidence \\nof ensuring separation within the IM PA pairs. It also includes the objective data analysis with \\nrespect to observed separation violations within and between the IM PA pairs on the arrivals. Subjective Data Assessment6.2.5.1\\nAt the end of Day 2 (QT3), after experiencing the nominal scenarios across all IM PA Tool and \\nmonitor configurations, controllers were asked: overall, I was confident that I could assess \\nwhether the separation between the IM Trail Aircraft and their Lead Aircraft would be \\nmaintained. Responses are shown for all TRACON (NCT and non-NCT combined) and Tower \\nOnly. Response Means and Standard Deviations are summarized in Table 5-7. Scale responses \\nare shown in Figure 5-8.

Overall, I was confident that I could assess whether the separation between the IM Trail \\nAircraft and their Lead Aircraft would be maintained. Note: o indicates NCT Controller responses. When asked if they could assess whether the separation between the IM Trail Aircraft and their \\nLead Aircraft would be maintained, the majority (80%) of TRACON controllers agreed (M=77.9; \\nSD=21.1). One TRACON controller disagreed and commented: Need CSL & WSL sooner. It is \\nunclear why CSL was noted since it was present at the start of the IM PA operation. Though not \\nshown, further analysis suggests the subjective separation assessment did not appear to be \\naffected by varying the alert timing. Another open-ended comment from a TRACON controller noted: Relying on the automation. \\nWithout it, I could not at this proximity. Objective Data Assessment6.2.5.2\\nAs noted in Section 4.5.7.2, the simulation recorded aircraft state data and PTT click data for \\neach scenario. This data was then post-processed to determine if any losses of separation \\noccurred and if so, whether monitor configuration or IM PA Tool configuration had any effect. \\nThis data only includes the Nominal and Alert Timing scenarios for Weeks 2-3 due to scenario \\nchanges after Week 1. The Day 3 Lateral Deviation scenarios were not included in the post-\\nprocessing analysis due to their complexity. There was one controller in Week 3 who had \\nconsiderable experience at a major tower, but no TRACON experience. This participants \\nseparation data is not included and 21 runs (across seven controller participants) were \\nevaluated for the Day 1-2 Nominal scenarios. The same number of runs, 21, were also evaluated \\nfor the Day 3 Alert Timing scenarios. Separation was considered within and between IM PA pairs. Within IM PA Pairs. Here, separation was considered lost if a trail aircraft crossed a CSL \\nor WSL boundary before a controller contacted it to provide breakout instructions. \\nContact was determined to have occurred if there was a PTT click between the time of a \\nCaution Alert and the aircraft crossing either safety limit. xv\\n Between Pairs. Here, separation was defined per the minima as described in Section \\n4.3.3. If the spacing between any non-IM PA combination of aircraft went below than \\nthe Wake Turbulence or MRS minima, it was considered a separation violation. The post-processing involved an automated script that examined the traffic data and flagged \\ninstances where the above separation definitions were violated. Each resulting case was then \\nverified manually against the controller display video capture videos and/or other MITRE \\nvisualization tools. MITRE controller subject matter expert (SME) input was used to make a final \\ndetermination of the instances that should count as violations. Across all the scenarios, the \\nnumber of separation violations that were observed is summarized in Table 5-8: Table 5-8. Number of Observed Separation Violations (Weeks 2-3) Separation Violations Within IM PA \\nPairs Between \\nPairs Day 1-2 Nominal 0 10 Day 3 Alert Timing 1 2 Within IM PA Pair Separation Violations For the seven TRACON Week 2-3 participants, there were zero IM PA separation violations \\nobserved for the 21 evaluated Day 1-2 Nominal scenarios. For the 21 evaluated Week 2-3, Day 3 Alert Timing scenarios, 5 cases were observed in which an \\nIM Trail Aircraft crossed a safety limit line while it was still being displayed. These may have \\nbeen cases, however, where the controller prioritized communicating a break out instruction to \\nthe aircraft before terminating IM PA in the automation. A controller PTT click was observed \\nbetween the time of the Caution Alert and the time of the crossing. As described in Section \\n5.1.2, due to the lack of override capability, it was also possible that the controller was blocked \\nand therefore the break out instruction could not be provided to the IM Trail Aircraft before IM \\nPA was terminated and the safety limit line was crossed. These cases were therefore not \\ncounted as violations as the controller may have in effect terminated the operation before the \\nline was crossed. Further analysis was performed to examine how soon the PTT click happened \\nin these cases before the crossing occurred. The results are shown in Table 5-9. Table 5-9. Day 3 Alert Timing Safety Limit Exceedances with PTT Response (Weeks 2-3) Case Alert Timing Safety Limit Crossed Time Between \\nPreceding PTT click and Crossing\\n1 25/15 WSL 8 sec\\n2 25/15 CSL 11 sec\\n3 25/15 CSL 9 sec\\n4 25/15 CSL 17 sec xvi\\n 5 25/15 WSL 9 sec M 10.8 sec\\nSD 3.6 sec Only a single separation violation case was observed for the 21 evaluated Week 2-3, Day 3 Alert \\nTiming scenarios, and it involved the 25/15 sec alert timing. In this scenario, an IM Trail Aircraft, \\nAAL2435, was deliberately designed to maintain a faster-than-normal speed on the approach so \\nthat the IM PA alerts would be triggered relative to its CSL. Shortly after the Predictive Alert was \\ndisplayed, the controller issued a 30 kt speed reduction to this aircraft. Per the instructions to \\nthe participants, the controller should then have terminated IM PA and broken the aircraft out. \\nHowever, the controller elected to keep the IM PA active and watch the situation. The aircraft \\nbegan to implement the 30 kt speed reduction but due to a simulation artifact, did not reduce \\nfurther to its final approach speed after the FAF. A",

This concept leverages the Required Time of Arrival capability that is available in many \\nFlight Management Systems (FMS). Under the TBM-RTA concept, controllers can issue \\nequipped aircraft an RTA to a fix, which pilots enter into the FMS. The aircrafts speed is then \\nadjusted by the FMS such that it meets the RTA. Additionally, if the RTA time is found to \\nexceed the speed envelope of the aircraft, the concept included using a Path Stretch Advisory \\nfunction which allowed controllers to assign an automation-provided Path Stretch solution along \\nwith an RTA. The Path Stretch maneuver reroutes the aircraft off the current route to a specified \\npoint, which is represented as a radial and nautical miles distance from the rejoin fix. Results \\nfrom the evaluation showed that the concept is operationally acceptable for pilots and controllers. \\nMoreover, RTA-operated flights showed lower cancellation rates and higher delivery accuracy at \\nthe meter point with smaller speed adjustments when compared to non-RTA flights.

FMS RTA Flights Summary \\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is implementing new automation capabilities, which \\nleverage investments made by both the FAA and Operators in Performance-Based Navigation \\n(PBN) and other flight deck capabilities; this will help transform the National Airspace System \\n(NAS) to Trajectory Based Operations (TBO) which is part of the Next Generation Air \\nTransportation System (NextGen) program. TBO is an air traffic management (ATM) method for \\nstrategically planning, managing, and optimizing flights by using time-based management \\n(TBM), information exchange between air and ground systems, and the aircrafts ability to fly \\nprecise paths. Expected benefits of TBO include enhanced flight efficiency, maximized airspace \\nand airport throughput, improved operational predictability, and increased operational flexibility. \\nThe successful operational transition to TBO relies in part on effective TBM, and for some origin-\\ndestination pairs, gate-to-gate TBM. TBM uses time to efficiently integrate traffic demand for \\nconstrained NAS resources; this goal is accomplished by use of automation to generate a \\nschedule at designated points of interest, which consists of flight-specific crossing times to \\nachieve the appropriate spacing interval. Effective TBM depends on accurate predictions by \\nautomation of expected flight crossing times and accurate calculation of a schedule, as well as the \\nuse of decision support tools (DSTs) by controllers and traffic managers to help meet the \\nschedule (e.g., meet time advisories) and modify it as schedule disruptions occur. \\nThe FAA has deployed numerous PBN procedures and routes throughout the NAS, and airspace \\nusers have started to realize benefits. However, the full set of PBN benefits will only be realized \\nwith TBOrequiring full integration between aircraft PBN capability, aircraft flight \\nmanagement capabilities, and air traffic strategic planning and TBM. TBM, also referred to as \\nmetering, is largely provided via the Time-Based Flow Management (TBFM) ground-based \\nsystem which is used to manage traffic to/from several airports today. Additionally, several \\nTBFM scheduling enhancements, such as Coupled Scheduling and Extended Metering \\nfunctionality, and new DSTs, that provide automated speed advisories and path change advisories \\nfor controllers, are in the process of implementation or planned for use across ATC domains [1]. \\nThese enhancements and tools will help controllers better manage flights to meet the \\ndesired/scheduled crossing times (i.e., aircraft delivery) at designated points (e.g., metering arcs, \\narrival fixes) along arrival routes and procedures. Moreover, some existing flight-deck \\ncapabilities can further improve upon the accuracy and efficiency by which those crossing times \\nare met. \\nThe most relevant of these existing flight deck capabilities, present in many aircraft Flight \\nManagement Systems (FMS), is the capability to accept an ATC-issued Required Time of \\nArrival (RTA) clearance to cross a given point in space at a specified time. The RTA clearance is \\nmet using real-time aircraft speed adjustments executed by the FMS. One advantage of using the \\nFMS to meet the time requirement is that the FMS can better account for wind and flight profile \\nuncertainties as compared with ground-based automation advisories. Moreover, the FMS RTA \\ncapability provides a tightly coupled closed-loop solution, updating its speed automatically to \\nadjust for forecast wind errors and unmodeled aircraft dynamics in order to meet the assigned \\nRTA. As a result, ATC does not need to frequently issue updated speed assignments to achieve \\nflight adjustments required to more accurately meet the metering crossing time target.\\nStakeholders have shown strong interest in using RTA-capable flights to achieve near-term TBM \\nobjectives [9]. The performance and behavior of airborne RTA has been extensively studied in \\nsimulations and operational trials [2], [3], [4] but not in the context of the FAAs envisioned ii TBO scope. Building on those previous studies, The MITRE Corporations Center for Advanced \\nAviation System Development (MITRE CAASD) performed analyses to develop and refine a \\nconcept for using RTA to more accurately meet a scheduled crossing time [6]. In this study, \\nMITRE simulated use of RTA in the context of a future en route TBM environment (consistent \\nwith initial TBO) that included TBM scheduling enhancements and DSTs that provided meet-\\ntime advisory options to aid controllers in managing flights to their scheduled crossing times in \\nan extended metering operation; the scope included Ground-based Interval Management-Spacing \\n(GIM-S) speed advisories [7] (currently available), the Delay Countdown Time (DCT) (currently \\navailable), and Path Stretch advisories [8] (a future capability). The proposed concept for \\nleveraging the aircraft RTA function is referred to in this paper as the TBM-RTA concept. iii Concept of Operations Summary for TBM-RTA2\\nAs indicated in Figure 1, the TBM-RTA concept combines the advanced arrival scheduling \\ncapabilities provided by the TBFM system and the aircraft FMS RTA function to enable \\nimproved delivery accuracy of multiple arrival streams to the terminal airspace boundary [1]. \\nCurrently, controllers issue speed and heading commands to pilots to meet the scheduled flight \\nspecific crossing times generated by the TBFM system. With the TBM-RTA concept, controllers \\nare envisioned as issuing an RTA clearance to the pilot using the TBFM generated Scheduled \\nTime of Arrival (STA) value (i.e., flight-specific crossing time) as the basis for the RTA; the \\npilot would input that value into the FMS and the avionics would adjust the aircraft speed to \\ncross the designated point at the STA. Figure 1. TBM-RTA Capabilities Overview The TBM-RTA operation is envisioned to be conducted in en route airspace only for meeting \\nSTAs at the Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) boundary Meter Fix (MF) or a \\nCoupled/Extended Meter Point (MP). The TBM-RTA operation begins when an aircraft crosses \\nthe respective en route TBFM scheduling Freeze Horizon (FH) and the TBFM system assigns an \\nSTA for a Meter Reference Point (MRP) of interest (which can be a MF or a MP). The relevant \\nMRP schedule information is directly available on the situation display for en route controllers \\nwho issue the arrival procedure to aircraft along with specific instructions for aircraft to meet \\nassigned STAs at the associated MRPs. The meet-time advisory options for each flight are \\nindicated (and can be accepted or rejected by the controller) both in the MRP list and in the flight \\ndatablock.\\nUnder the TBM-RTA concept,",
