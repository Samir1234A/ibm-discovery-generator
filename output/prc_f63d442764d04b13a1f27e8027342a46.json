Maintain employees self-efficacy when environmental conditions change (for \\nexample, new legislation or new threats impacting Payment Integrity) by \\nensuring they have the necessary skills through organizational training and \\nmentoring programs and ensuring that their effort and focus do, in fact, result in \\nhigher performance. f. Work with employees to enhance existing and identify new strategies that will \\nhelp them achieve their individual, as well as their organizations, Payment \\nIntegrity goals. For example, solicit their ideas for responding to changing \\nconditions instead of imposing solutions on them. \\n18 See recommendation 1 in MITREs report, GOVERNMENT-WIDE PAYMENT INTEGRITY: NEW APPROACHES AND \\nSOLUTIONS NEEDED (MTR 160040, February 2016), regarding establishing a government-wide Payment Integrity \\nleadership group. 19 g. Emphasize the importance of Payment Integrity to states, grantees, and others \\nacting on behalf of agencies at every opportunity, to help ensure the federal-level \\ntone at the top is clearly understood. 2. Set Clear Agency Goals for Payment Integrity with Accountability for Achieving \\nThem. Agencies should focus on achievable, concrete, measurable, long-term goals \\nfor reducing improper payments, and ensure these goals are appropriately related \\nto customer service and programmatic results (see Table 1 above). Aggressive near-\\nterm reduction goals, especially if they are isolated from customer service and \\nprogrammatic goals, tend to motivate agencies to choose ineffective stop-gap \\nsolutions which focus primarily on treating the symptoms rather than rectifying the \\ntrue root causes of improper payments. Instead, agencies need to be accountable for \\nreducing their improper payments over the long term, and need to be rewarded for \\nachieving appropriate reduction goals. Actions needed include: a. Providing recognition for agencies for achieving these goalsfor example, \\nformal government-wide awards, or a Better Business Bureau style seal of \\napproval. b. Identifying and resolving any ambiguity in and conflict between organizational \\nlevel goals by examining and, as needed, modifying these goals to ensure desired \\nPayment Integrity outcomes are overtly addressed. c. Identifying rewards pertaining to compliance with IPERA requirements, such as \\nallowing agencies to retain a percentage of improper payment dollars prevented \\nor recovered (beyond what IPERA currently allows) for future investment in \\nPayment Integrity activities. d. Identifying consequences pertaining to compliance with IPERA requirements, \\nsuch as leveraging funding cuts for agencies as a long-term consequence for \\nfailure to achieve their improper payment reduction goals. 3. More Closely Balance the Priorities of Mission and Management. Agency \\nofficials have described their dilemma in key programs between making benefits \\npayments at a certain time (mission), and making sure the payments are proper \\n(management). a. Executive Branch leadership needs to clarify government-wide expectations \\nregarding Payment Integrity to encourage agencies to more closely balance \\nmission and management. b. Agencies need to ensure their programmatic goals and process objectives \\nestablish an appropriate balance between mission and management. 4. Emphasize Coordinated, Cross-Government Approaches to Payment Integrity \\nChallenges. To facilitate systemic solutions, a centralized organization with \\ndecision making, enforcement and political power should facilitate the effective \\ncoordination of agencies, pooling of resources, achieving of synergies, and \\npromotion of accountability in tackling cross-government Payment Integrity 20 challenges. Under OMBs leadership, a government-wide Payment Integrity \\nleadership group, such as the working group mandated by the Fraud Reduction and \\nData Analytics Act of 2015, could form such a strong, centralized decision making \\nbody to develop goals and strategies and to promote accountability for Payment \\nIntegrity among the heads of agencies.19 Further, as the Comptroller General of GAO \\nnoted in his February 15, 2017, testimony before the Committee on Oversight and \\nGovernment Reform, House of Representatives, This working groupshould help \\nagencies to coordinate their fraud detection efforts20 5. Address Statutory Barriers. Legislative barriers can be de-motivators. a. As previously recommended, address statutes that appear to create or \\ncontribute to improper payments in selected major programs.21 b. Include an examination of statutory requirements and restrictions, and their \\nimpacts, regarding how states can spend funds on Payment Integrity activities. 6. Explore Funding Options to Strengthen Payment Integrity. Develop approaches \\nto provide agencies and states with Payment Integrity funding that would not \\nincrease budgets, such as: a. Ensuring agencies are taking full advantage of the provisions of IPERA and OMB \\nCircular A-123, Appendix C, for identifying and using recovered overpayments to \\nhelp fund financial management improvement programs to address problems \\nthat directly contribute to improper payments. b. Considering Public-Private Partnerships that can provide a way for government, \\ncommercial, academic, and non-profit entities to collaborate on issues of mutual \\ninterest and share the burden of time, labor, and investment.22 \\n19 See recommendation 1 in MITREs report, GOVERNMENT-WIDE PAYMENT INTEGRITY: NEW APPROACHES AND \\nSOLUTIONS NEEDED (MTR 160040, February 2016), regarding establishing a government-wide Payment Integrity \\nleadership group. \\n20 HIGH-RISK SERIES Progress on Many High-Risk Areas, While Substantial Efforts Needed on Others (GAO-17-375T, \\nFebruary 15, 2017) \\n21 See recommendation 13 in MITREs report, GOVERNMENT-WIDE PAYMENT INTEGRITY: NEW APPROACHES AND \\nSOLUTIONS NEEDED (MTR 160040, February 2016), regarding addressing statutes that appear to create or contribute\\nvia program design, definitions, etc.to improper payments in selected major programs. \\n22 See recommendation 15 in MITREs report, GOVERNMENT-WIDE PAYMENT INTEGRITY: NEW APPROACHES AND \\nSOLUTIONS NEEDED (MTR 160040, February 2016), regarding establishing Public-Private Partnerships to address \\nPayment Integrity challenges. 21 c. Establishing a revolving fund for multi-agency \\npilot projects to enhance collaboration for, and \\ndevelop innovative approaches to, solving cross-\\ngovernment problems (for example, common \\nissues involving identity or eligibility). i. Agencies could borrow from the fund and \\nrepay it when the projects are completed. ii. The fund could be used to implement the \\nFebruary 2016 MITRE recommendation to \\nassess existing metrics to determine \\nwhether there are better ways to measure \\nthe return on investment for pre-pay \\nanalytics in order to better justify such \\ninvestments.23 d. Evaluating the potential for a similar revolving \\nfund at the state level, once pilot projects prove \\nthe viability of a federal-level fund. 7. Consider Payment Integrity When Modernizing \\nInformation Technology Systems and Developing Shared Services. When modernizing information \\ntechnology systems and developing shared services, include consideration of \\nprocess redesign that will enable human resources to be shifted toward higher \\nvalue, greater engagement work (for example, analytics of improper payments true \\nroot causes) that will increase employee investment and morale. \\n23 See recommendations 3 and 12 in MITREs report, GOVERNMENT-WIDE PAYMENT INTEGRITY: NEW APPROACHES \\nAND SOLUTIONS NEEDED (MTR 160040, February 2016), regarding preventing errors and deterring fraud, and pre-pay \\nanalytics, respectively. White House Chief \\nInformation Officer Tony \\nScott's proposal for a $3.1 \\nbillion revolving fund \\ndesigned to pay for \\n[information technology] \\nmodernizationa variation \\nof which passed in the \\nHousecould be one of \\nthose solutions to the future \\n \\nit's one of the solutions, \\n[U.S. Controller David] \\nMader said. \\nGovernment Shared Services Meet Challenges in People, Capital (NextGov, \\nDecember 7, 2016) REVOLVING FUNDS 22 3 What Motivates ClaimantsIndividuals and Organizations Filing Benefits Claims, Tax Returns, Commercial Invoices, Etc.to Be Accurate and Not Make Errors or Commit Fraud? The motivation to be accurate and not make errors or commit fraud when submitting \\nclaims of various types to the government can arise from sources both extrinsic and \\nintrinsic to the individual. How agencies are viewedin terms of trust and poweralso \\nplays an important role. While no single model takes into account all the relevant factors \\nthat affect such motivation, agencies can nevertheless take advantage of all these \\npossibilities to motivate claimants to be accurate and not make errors, and to deter them \\nfrom committing fraud. In conducting this portion of the study, the great majority of the research MITRE identified \\nand reviewed pertained to individual motivation vis--vis tax compliance. Some of that \\nresearch mentioned organizations, but there was no discussion of the behavior specifically \\nof large organizations. For the purposes of the analysis that follows, MITRE assumes that \\nthe behavior of individuals when interacting with non-tax agencies is generally the same as \\nwhen interacting with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). However, people do not \\nnecessarily view other federal agencies with the same degree of trust, power or \\ncompetence as they view IRS. So it is possible that some individuals may not respond to \\nthese other agencies in the same way that they respond to IRS motivating actions. 3.1 Extrinsic Motivation Extrinsic motivation is a reward or incentive from a person or \\nentity intended to induce another person to take an action. An \\nextrinsic motivator may be necessary when a person is not \\nsufficiently motivated intrinsically, such as by a personal desire \\nto achieve a goal or complete a task. Examples of extrinsic \\nmotivators include the following. In education, grades are an extrinsic motivator for learning and achievement. In organizations, compensation, public praise, and employee awards are extrinsic \\nmotivators to inspire employees towards high performance. 3.1.1 The Traditional or Classical Economic Deterrence Model Extrinsic motivation in Payment Integrity usually focuses on \\ntraditional deterrence theory, which is based on the economics-\\nof-crime model. The model is most frequently applied to tax evasion, where it is believed \\nthat the probability of being examined and the magnitude of the possible penalty are 23 correlated with the level of voluntary tax compliance. This represents essentially a risk-\\nbased approach, where the probability of being examined equates to",
