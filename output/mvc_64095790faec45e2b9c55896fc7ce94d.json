  "text": "information. \\nIoT systems, however, commonly fall under the term Operational Technology, and add a new dimension \\nin that they have a physical component. They can often directly manipulate or respond to the physical world \\nand/or directly respond to it. The result is a manifold increase in the possible consequences from undesired \\nfunctionality. These now include, but are not limited to, impacts on physical property, availability of critical \\nservices, availability of physical resources, potential impacts on the environment, and potential threats to \\nhuman health and safety. Taming system computational complexity is a difficult and ongoing challenge. To do that, it is critical to \\nhave a means to understand each system, its dependencies and interdependencies, and to understand how Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 18-1212 / DHS reference number 17-J-00100-01 Mittal, Cane, Schmidt, Tufarolo and Harris failures of one component impacts aspects of the whole. With the rise of IoT and its corresponding expanded \\nimpact pattern, an optimal mitigation strategy needs to encompass the new range of physical impacts as \\nwell. Figure 6: PES for IoT-Inclusive System Figure 7: PES hypergraph with only two LogicalDevice and two Connection-Wired entities The following section presents an approach to modeling systems with IoT devices. This modeling approach \\nprovides a way to apply rigor to the problem of tracing operational dependencies within such a system as a \\nmeans to highlight potential vulnerability sources. By identifying the most likely cascading failure sources, \\nand tracing the failure consequences to any eventual physical impact, one can determine how best to apply \\nmitigations that avoid the most damaging cascades (Zimmerman and Restrepo 2009). While this model \\ncannot predict the unpredictable (e.g., which systems will be attacked, or which will have a software \\nvulnerability), it can help one understand the relationship between components and better clarify where risk \\nmitigation strategies will be most effective. 6 IOT MODEL In order to model the IoT in its environment, we identify the following fourteen perspectives. Each \\nperspective is necessary to understand the multi-dimensional nature of IoT. The perspectives are \\nenumerated in Table 1. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.

Case Number 18-1212 / DHS reference number 17-J-00100-01 Table 1: Fourteen IoT-Inclusive System Perspectives ID Perspective Description 1 Behavior Describes the overall macro IoT behavior as a whole. The behavior could be \\nemergent (i.e. IoT resulted from devices just being connected to the Internet) or \\nengineered (i.e. IoT resulted from following engineering practices). 2 Application \\nDomain Identifies various environmental variables and properties that monitor the \\nusefulness of a particular IoT solution and its application to a single or multiple \\nsectors. It also describes the effect a particular IoT solution has on a sectorial basis. 3 Physical \\nstructure Describes the logical structure of a Thing: a sensor, an actuator, an aggregator \\nassembling multiple inputs for a single output, or more specifically, a computing \\ndevice having variable computational power levels. 4 Services Describes various services a Thing consumes or provides to other components on \\nthe Network. Essentially, IoT solves a business problem or creates opportunities \\nto develop new business cases, eventually leading to formulation of new business \\nprocesses. 5 Resources Describes resources, their management and supply-demand within an IoT system \\ndeployment 6 Information Describes the knowledge structure as it is exchanged between resources, across \\nnetwork and various Things. 7 Network Describes the network structure between two Things. The geographical distance \\nand relative compatibility between two things may ultimately decide what kind of \\nresources are invoked along the pathways. 8 Vulnerability Describes the vulnerability inherent in the IoT deployment across multiple \\nperspectives. The vulnerabilities need to be specified at the intersection of various \\nperspectives define in this list. Various scoring systems such as Common \\nVulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) (First.org n.d.), Common Weakness \\nScoring System (CWSS) (Coley 2014), etc. can be used to assess vulnerability \\ninherent in an IoT deployment. 9 Organizations Describes various organizations having vested interest in a given IoT deployment. \\nMultiple organizations may be involved in multiple IoT deployments requiring \\nshared services, resources, information and applications 10 Security Describes security mechanisms and technologies 11 Privacy Describe privacy mechanisms and technologies 12 Analytics Describes the analytics required to ascertain the correct functioning of an IoT \\ndeployment. These will involve both macro and micro levels so that the impact \\nand influence of a Thing can be viewed in relation to a particular Application \\ndomain or Sector as a whole. Eventually, such analytic frameworks will be used \\nfor instrumentation and control at a critical infrastructure level. 13 Policy Describes the relationship between multiple perspective to specify and define \\npolicies at the intersection of various perspectives. Mittal, Cane, Schmidt, Tufarolo and Harris Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 18-1212 / DHS reference number 17-J-00100-01 14 Users Describes the users involved in an IoT deployment. It may include the end-user, \\nthe transient user (i.e., a user who indirectly uses an IoT as in third-party services, \\ne.g., marketing services), and the organizations that use the applications within a\\ntypical IoT deployment. The perspectives described in Table 1 portrays an abstract IoT-Inclusive system representation. Each \\nperspective is modeled as an SES aspect. The SES model can help identify relationships between various \\nIoT perspectives that need to be considered for an IoT deployed solution. These relationships are depicted \\nby walks as described for Figure 6. Figure 8 provides a sample depiction of an IoT-Inclusive SES model. \\nThis model exhibits the following options: Ignoring the multi-aspect numbers, we have: (2 Behaviors) x (4 LogicalDevice types) x (3 Services) \\nx (2 Connection types) x (5 CommunicationProtocol types) x (2 Timeliness analytics types) x (6 \\nComputingAnalytics types) x (4 ResourceItems types), resulting in 12000 IoT deployment \\noptions/use-cases. This number does not even consider the combinations associated with entities: \\nResource, DataElement, Domain, Capability, AttackEffects, and Orgs. One can easily imagine the \\nincrease in permutations from thousands to millions of options. As stated earlier, each structural option enumerated in the above permutation can be realized as a valid \\nsystem architecture. This exploration also involves constraints and scores attributable to each of the nodes \\nthat may help in overall risk assessment. Conducting performance and risk analysis on each option shown \\nin this high-level model would be resource intensive and cost-prohibitive. As more constraints are added \\nby applying the pruning process, the IoT model moves closer to the specific IoT solution, and therefore, the \\nrisk quantification should become more tractable, both visually and mathematically.

Case Number 18-1212 / DHS reference number 17-J-00100-01 The theoretical model brings forward fourteen perspectives in a foundational IoT-Inclusive-System. It \\nshows how various entities constitute cross-references in different nodes, resulting in hyperedges that have \\nentire graphs on either side of the hyperedge. Associating various vulnerability types and risk scores to each \\nof the entities in the abstract model yields the needed abstraction level to understand the risk impact at a \\nmacro level. Further specification of constraints helps us understand risk for a family of IoT-Inclusive-\\nSystems. 7 INTEGRATED RISK EVALUATION FRAMEWORK IoT bridges IT, which is primarily concerned with data processes and OT, which is concerned with physical \\nprocesses. Both IT and OT have mature and robust risk assessment and management methodologies. \\nHowever, now that these communities are connected by IoT, differences in each communitys perspective \\ncan skew or result in incomplete, risk assessments. Understanding the potential technical consequences \\nassociated with a device or functional unit is only one, early piece in a procedure for understanding the \\noperational risk associated with that device. To understand operational risk, technical consequences need \\nto be turned into operational consequences, which are expressed in terms of their impact on the IoT-\\ninclusive system as a whole. Doing this requires an understanding of the context in which a given technical \\nconsequence occurs. This sort of context could be provided by associating the technical consequence with \\nelements in a model of the IoT system, such as described in",
