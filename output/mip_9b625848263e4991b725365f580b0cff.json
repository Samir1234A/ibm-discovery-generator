These include improvements in communication, navigation, \\nand surveillance systems, such as the deployment of Automatic Dependent Surveillance-\\nBroadcast (ADS-B), and expanded use of trajectory based operations (TBO), including time-\\nbased aircraft spacing and scheduling. New traffic management concepts based on the \\nconfluence of these technologies are intended to mitigate the potential for increased delays in \\nthe NAS and projected airport capacity shortfalls. One such concept is Interval Management (IM) which refers to an application suite, enabled by \\nAutomatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), providing greater air traffic system \\nthroughput and efficiency by improving inter-aircraft spacing precision. IM is a tactical capability \\nused to manage spacing based on a separation standard, miles-in-trail restriction, or any air \\ntraffic control (ATC) spacing objective. Or, as it relates to TBO, to the metering schedule. IM avionics (termed flight deck-based IM [FIM] Equipment) provide speed commands to the \\nflight crew enabling them to manage a desired spacing relative to a Lead Aircraft. The closed-\\nloop nature of IM allows for more accurate speed adjustments to achieve the desired spacing \\nfor a given flight segment than can be provided by a ground system. As shown in Figure 1-1, this \\nleads to improved inter-aircraft spacing precision and allows aircraft to be consistently spaced \\ncloser to the separation standard or metering constraints, thus increasing throughput in \\ncapacity-constrained airspace. IM is primarily being developed to increase arrival throughput at \\nmetered airports; however, it is also expected to enable more efficient spacing during high \\ntraffic periods at other facilities as well. Figure 1-1. Improved Spacing Consistency with IM An initial set of avionics standards supporting a limited set of IM operations were published by \\nRTCA Special Committee (SC) 186 Working Group (WG) 4 in 2015 (RTCA, 2015). Three years \\nlater, an FAA Systems Engineering Working Group (SEWG) developed an Advanced IM (A-IM) \\nConcept of Operations (ConOps) for IM during arrivals and approaches, and en route and \\nterminal merging operations (FAA, 2017b). In conjunction with that activity, RTCA SC-186 WG4 ii\\n group is currently updating the Flight-deck Interval Management (FIM) Safety and Performance \\nRequirements (SPR) (DO-328A) (RTCA, 2019a) and the FIM Minimum Operational Performance \\nStandards (MOPS) (DO-361) (RTCA, 2019b) documents to enable the A-IM operations included \\nin the ConOps. This includes enabling more complex route geometries, such as an IM and Lead \\nAircraft arriving to parallel or crossing or converging dependent runway configurations. In \\naddition, these updates improve the utility of IM operations through further integration with \\ndata communications, leveraging air/ground trajectory synchronization, and better \\nperformance from the use of higher fidelity wind data. There are many possible applications of IM with varying operational objectives, desired spacing \\nbehavior, and operating environments. One of the advanced concepts supported by the new \\nstandards and ConOps is IM Paired Approach (PA), which is intended for use on dependent \\napproaches to Closely-Spaced Parallel Runways (CSPRs) (i.e., separated by less than 2,500 feet \\n[ft]). IM PA provides a means for CSPR approach and landing operations to continue in weather \\nconditions where visual separation cannot be maintained. IM PA maximizes arrival throughput \\nin IMC by minimizing the in-trail spacing between successive arrivals without compromising \\nsafety. For example, IM PA may be able to preserve two runway operations at San Francisco \\nInternational Airport (SFO) to applicable Category (CAT) I minima for the approaches in use \\nStassen, et al. (2013). The FAA, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), The MITRE Corporations \\nCenter for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD), and others have been conducting \\nresearch on PA as a separate ADS-B concept for over two decades. In 2016, RTCA SC-186 WG4 \\ndecided to make PA an IM application and include it in the updated FIM Equipment \\nrequirements. Through this process, stakeholders determined controllers must be able to \\nmonitor the operation relative to a separation standard. This requires controllers to be able to \\nassess separation within an IM PA pair and take effective action before separation is lost. \\nTherefore, the IM PA concept was changed from that described in Stassen, et al. (2013), to \\nmove the safety limit monitoring function was move from being a flight crew responsibility and \\nFIM Equipment capability to a ground capability, likely to be hosted in Standard Terminal \\nAutomation Replacement System (STARS). To validate the revised PA concept, the FAAs Surveillance Broadcast Services (SBS) Program \\nOffice tasked MITRE CAASD to develop and execute a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) simulation \\nexperiment to address open controller acceptability and feasibility questions, provide input to \\nair and ground system requirements, and mitigate technical risks associated with the revised PA \\nconcept. This HITL simulation helped define the controllers role in IM PA and informed the \\ndesign of new ground tools needed to enable the operation. These features were developed by \\nMITRE CAASD for the FAAs Closely Spaced Parallel Operations (CSPO) Program Office in \\ncoordination with SBS and the FAAs Operational Concepts, Validation, and Requirements office \\nin 2017. The results and recommendations should be considered by RTCA SC-186, FAA SBS \\nProgram Office, FAA Aircraft Certification, and FAA Flight Standards as IM PA proceeds through \\nconcept development. This document presents the findings of the simulation and has seven main sections including \\nthis one. Section 2 Background, Concept Description, and Prior Research provides an overview \\nof CSPR arrival operations, the IM PA concept, and summarizes relevant past work. Section \\n3Research Goals, Questions, and Hypotheses presents the main research questions and iii\\n hypotheses for this study. Section 4Experiment Methodology describes how the simulation \\nwas conducted. Section 5Results summarizes the results of the data collection, including the \\nstatistical analyses. Section 6Discussion reviews the major findings and puts them in an \\noperational context. Section 7Conclusions and Recommendations reviews the key findings and \\nprovides recommendations for continued IM PA development and future research. 2 i\\n 1 Except for the 7110.308C operation, which is described later, and which does not quite fill the throughput gap. \\n2 At SFO, the two runway visual operations rate is 54, and the single runway rate is 32. However, SFO can also use 7110.308C which allows them to use staggered approaches down to Cat I minima, with a rate between 34 and 36. \\n3 At SFO, to facilitate departures, arrival aircraft may be paired (i.e., they are side-by or nearly so) so that arrivals may cross Background, Concept Description, and Prior Research3\\nThis section provides an overview of the CSPR operational environment, describes the IM PA \\nconcept including its potential implementation at SFO, and summarizes past PA and IM research \\nthat is relevant to this study. Closely Spaced Parallel Runway Arrival Operations 3.1\\nParallel runways spaced closer than 2500 ft are defined as closely spaced parallel runways \\n(CSPRs). Current separation minima require that such runways be treated as one for arrivals and \\ndepartures, unless other types of separation (e.g. visual or 7110.308C) are used in place of \\nstandard radar separation. To maximize throughput for CSPRs, facilities employ simultaneous \\nvisual approaches whenever possible. During simultaneous visual approach operations to CSPRs, \\nmaximum arrival throughput relies on the use of pilot-provided visual separation between two \\narrival aircraft. This effectively allows two streams of traffic to the CSPRs. However if aircraft \\ncannot provide its own visual separation relative to a lead aircraft on the CSPR, one of the \\naircraft is broken out of the flow. This results in a single runway operation1 and loss of \\nthroughput. As described in FAA (2017a), the application of visual separation is relatively straightforward in \\ngood Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) when conditions exceed visual approach minima. \\nVisual approach minima are required to be at least MVA+500, where the MVA is the Minimum \\nVectoring altitude. In actual operations, the minima to which Terminal Radar Approach Controls \\n(TRACONs) will conduct visual approaches vary greatly from airport to airport, depending on the \\nairspace and the airport operations. At SFO, for example, visual operations can be conducted \\nwith relative ease for ceilings and visibilities exceeding 5000 ft and 10 miles. However, pilot-\\napplied visual separation is more difficult in Marginal Meteorological Conditions (MMC). At SFO, \\nfor example, these consist of a ceiling of ~4000 ft and 5-7 miles visibility. Pilot-applied visual separation is impossible in IMC with ceiling and visibility less than 1000 ft \\nand 3 miles, respectively. When",
