  "sdl_extracted_summary": "STARs to find the best matching route for the track. The aircraft identity, engine type, and wake vortex category \\nare inferred from the aircraft type associated with the track data and the initial conditions for the aircraft are taken \\nfrom the point that is closest to the starting point of the selected route. Finally, scenarios can be generated randomly using a set of parameters (refer to Figure 10). The primary drivers \\nare the scenarios total duration, the desired demand in aircraft per hour, and a noise value. For each of the routes \\navailable to the scenario, an estimated flight time is calculated. The reciprocal of the demand rate is used to specify \\nan aircraft arrival interval. Random arrival times are calculated by generating a uniform random value in the range \\nof plus or minus half the noise value, and adding that to the arrival interval time. The aircraft is assigned a route \\nbased on a load balance specified by the user, and the estimated flight time is subtracted from the randomly \\ngenerated arrival time to generate the aircrafts start time. \\nFigure 10. Creating a Random TBFM Scenario. H. Metrics and Reporting \\nOnce one or more scenarios are defined, the user evaluates a specific scenario by running it through the trajectory modeling and scheduling functions using a set of unmodified or modified TBFM adaptations. Normally, \\nTBFM operates in a continuous process, where the information that is available to the scheduler changes over time, \\nand the aircraft in the schedule are updating estimates based on operational constraints and decisions made by pilots \\nand controllers, which means that TBFM is constantly producing updated schedules based on the most recent \\ninformation it has. For speed and simplicity, the integrated design capability runs only once, given the initial state \\nof the scenario, and produces a conflict-free schedule at all the scheduling Metering Reference Points (MRPs). American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 16 The scheduled arrival of all the aircraft is then displayed to the user in a timeline view, which resembles the \\nTGUI from the operational TBFM system (refer to Figure 11). The timeline view is zoom-able and pan-able \\nallowing the user to explore the full range of times in the schedule. ETAs at a point of interest are shown to the left \\nof the timeline, and STAs to the same point are shown to the right of the timeline. If the STA is later than the ETA, \\nthe aircraft identifier and timestamp are rendered with a delay annotation. The timeline starts by displaying the \\narrival runways, but the user can add additional timelines for other scheduled points of interest, eliminate timelines, \\nand sort them. Several other scheduling delay metrics including various histogram views, waypoint delay, and \\nsegment level delays are available. Visualizations are provided to allow the user to explore the schedule and delay \\ndata set from these various perspectives, and examine both averages and histogram distributions of delay for \\ndifferent areas of the adaptation. \\nFigure 11. Example TBFM Scheduling Results Analysis VI. Use Cases and Applications \\nAs part of the development of the integrated design capability, an agile development approach was utilized. This approach included the development team gathering several user stories from the domain subject matter experts that \\nare familiar with the PBN and TBFM design space. These user stories consisted of short, simple descriptions of desired \\nfeatures and applications of the prototype from the perspective of the users. This section discusses some example \\napplications that were derived based on the user stories and they describe how the prototype can be used to support \\nvarious analyses that are typically needed as part of PBN and TBFM design activities. The example applications \\nreferenced here are not intended to cover all the types of analyses that could be performed as part of an integrated \\ndesign activity. Given the functional nature by which the prototype has been designed, a wide variety of analyses can \\nbe conducted ranging from adaptation visualization, parameter modifications, and scenarios based simulations. The following applications were explored in our research to demonstrate how the integrated design capability could \\nsupport PBN and TBFM design activities: Adaptation Analysis: Application is focused on the analysis of an existing TBFM adaptation through the \\nvisualization and exploration of the supported integrated design capability components. Nominal Interior Routes Analysis: Application is focused on analysis of the TBFM nominal interior \\nTRACON routes through the supported integrated design capability components and existing TARGETS \\nfeatures for radar track data analysis. Delay Distribution Analysis: Application is focused on the functionality available to inform questions \\nregarding TBFM delay distribution, specifically to determine what settings should be used to provide a \\nconsistent flow of aircraft into TRACON airspace without adversely impacting throughput. Adaptation Change Analysis: Application is focused on the functionality available to analyze \\nmodifications to an adaptation. Specifically, focusing on analyzing a baseline TBFM adaptation that was \\nmodified to support an new STAR procedure. American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 17 Ground Interval Management-Spacing (GIM-S) Implementation Comparative Analysis: Application \\nis focused on viewing and better understanding the comparative impact of adding GIM-S (e.g. extended \\nmetering) to an arrival stream. GIM-S Design Optimization: Application is focused on comparing an existing GIM-S design against a \\nmodified GIM-S design to determine the optimization impacts to delay allocation. Stream Class Setting Evaluation: Application is focused on evaluating stream class settings which enable \\ndelivery of sufficient aircraft to the TRACON without causing excessive low-altitude vectoring. \\nThe following describes one of the example applications of the integrated design capability, which involves determining the appropriate values for TBFM adaptation parameters that are frequently modified when adapting a \\nsite, more specifically the parameters used for delay distribution. The explored parameters are the AMDT values in \\nthe adaptation, which represent the maximum delay that can be absorbed within the performance characteristics of a \\nlarge set of aircraft types on the trajectory between two assigned metering reference point segments. There are two \\ntypes of delay distribution AMDT parameters that can be adjusted: Upstream AMDT parameters: Parameters used only to distribute delay between existing outer arcs as \\nwell as between outer arcs and runways. These parameters do not affect the aircraft sequencing and spacing \\nthat the TBFM simplified scheduler produces. Downstream AMDT parameters: Parameters used to specify how much delay can be absorbed within the \\nTRACON (i.e. downstream from the meter fix). These can be specified based on the individual meter fix to \\nrunway route via the RMD parameter and/or through a generic TRACON AMDT parameter. The example application analyzes the upstream AMDT parameters based on the same TBFM adaptation model \\nthat was described previously. The analyst first generates scenario aircraft from track data that was obtained from a \\nrecorded radar data source and the scenario is then selected for evaluation. In this case, the analyst selects the \\nscenario based on representative PHX imported arrival tracks. Following the evaluation, the analyst is presented \\nwith the timeline view and can add additional metering reference points of interest which, in this case, consist of the \\nGEELA and SQUEZ meter fixes as well as PHX8 and PHX7R runway threshold metering points. The timeline \\nallows the analyst to evaluate the specific aircraft sequencing and aircraft specific delay that has been allocated at \\nthe points of interest. In addition to the aircraft-specific information available through the timeline view, the analyst \\ncan analyze the results in more detail. In this case, the analyst examines first the aggregate delay by arrival gate and \\ndetermines that the scheduler has allocated the SUNSS gate an average of 39 seconds of delay while the other gates \\nhave been allocated an average delay of about 10 seconds. Finally, to better understand how delay impacts the specific meter fixes, the analyst can choose to view the non-\\naggregate and aggregate average delay organized by arrival meter fix. In this case the non-aggregate delays which \\naccount for the delay that was absorbed at upstream meter fixes is selected and the analyst determines that the \\nscheduler has allocated the SQUEZ meter fix an average of 45 seconds of delay while the other meter fixes have \\nbeen allocated a delay of under 10 seconds. Based on these results, the analyst determines that the sector that meters to the SQUEZ meter fix experiences \\nhigher average delays then the sectors feeding BRUSR, HOMRR, and PAYNT; the other arrival gates. While these \\nexact delay amounts occur because of the specific traffic scenario that was evaluated, it was discovered that the \\nTBFM adaptation parameter pertaining to the distribution of delay between the SQUEZ meter fix and the associated \\nouter arc was to set to 1 minute, compared to the other meter fixes that had a 0 minute AMDT parameter value on \\nthe first outer arc segment. Due to this realization, the analyst decides to set the SUN/OA/J outer arc parameters to 0 \\nminutes as well, thus pushing the delay assigned to Jet aircraft to upstream sectors, outer arcs, and meter points. The \\nscenario was re-evaluated using the new adaptation parameter value and comparative results are shown in Figure 12. \\nAs indicated, this adaptation",

  "text": "The Cybersecurity Framework was developed via collaboration among \\ngovernment, industry, and academia in response to White House Executive Order 13636 calling \\nfor a framework to reduce cybersecurity risks to critical infrastructure. The framework references \\nglobally recognized standards for cybersecurity to guide organizations of all sizes and technical \\nsophistication on elements that should be included in a comprehensive cybersecurity program. The Practice Guide was published in draft format in November 2015 and authored through a \\ncollaborative process among MITRE, industry participants, and NCCoE researchers. Since \\npublication, the Practice Guide has received feedback from the public and cybersecurity industry \\nthat will be addressed in an update to the Practice Guide. The forthcoming Practice Guide will \\nfocus on the current threat landscape and will incorporate mobile-focused cybersecurity \\ntechnologies that have evolved since the original publication. A full mapping of the Practice Guide security characteristics to the Cybersecurity Framework \\nand other relevant standards is included in Appendix A. 1.2 Scope \\nThis projects objective is to assess the applicability of the Practice Guide to Australian \\norganizations by determining how the Practice Guide maps to laws, regulations, standards, and \\nguidelines that drive mobile device security practices within Australia. The remainder of the \\ndocument describes the approach and analysis used in this effort. Furthermore, this report \\n8 provides AustCyber with a recommended path forward for improving mobile device security for \\nAustralian organizations. 1.3 Report Structure \\nSection 2, Mobile Device Environment, describes the use and types of mobile devices within \\nAustralian organizations. Section 3, Approach, speaks to the process followed to create this \\nreport. Section 4, Identified Laws, Standards, and Guidelines, lists the laws, standards, and \\nguidelines reviewed to create this report. Section 5, Laws, Standards, and Guidelines, maps those \\nlaws, standards, and guidelines determined to be most relevant to mobile devices to practice \\nguide security characteristics. Section 6, Findings and Recommendations, suggests modifications \\nwhere practice guide recommendations may be tailored to best address the mobile cybersecurity \\nconcerns facing Australian organizations that have limited cybersecurity expertise. Mobile Device Environment \\nThe first step in our analysis was to understand the Australian environment within which mobile \\ndevices are used. This section summarizes that environment by looking at the following issues: \\nthe way those devices are utilized, the types of mobile devices used by Australian organizations, \\nand the mobile device threat landscape. 2.1 Mobile Device Usage \\nMobile devices have become an integral component of day-to-day operations for Australian \\nbusinesses. Organizations largely use cloud-based email and social media tools in their day-to-\\nday mobile business applications. Googles GSuite and Microsofts Office365 services are two \\ncommonly cited for basic email functionality. This is due to their low cost, ease of use, and \\nfunctionalityso these tools are often used without considering the business risks and benefits. A \\n2014 report by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) notes that 47 \\npercent of SMEs connected to the internet used some type of cloud computing service [6]. \\nFurther, a 2015 report entitled Report 1Australians Digital Lives asserts that 26 percent of \\nbusinesses utilize social media for marketing/advertising purposes [7]. Also, organizations are \\nheavily dependent on cloud-based file backup and accounting systems on mobile devices to store \\npersonal information, corporate data, and financial, health, and other sensitive records. \\nOrganizations across different sectors tend to allow personal devices to access the \\naforementioned business applications with very little thought given to threat mitigation. \\nAustralian organizations, particularly SMEs that are implementing bring-your-own-device \\n(BYOD) policies, may note a gap at the how to level due to the lack of a specific BYOD \\narchitecture. This was informed by roundtable discussions where the use of BYOD deployment \\nmodel by Australian organizations, particularly SMEs, was deemed commonplace. 2.2 Mobile Device Types \\nSimilar to the environment in the United States, organizations in Australia tend to use off-the- \\nshelf mobile devices such as Apple iPhones and various Android devices, including the Samsung \\nGalaxy Series, to conduct business. DeviceAtlas, a popular source of device data, appears to bear \\nthis out with iPhone and Galaxy devices composing all the top 20 positions of device usage for \\nAustralia [8]. \\n9 Apple iOS was found to be the preferred platform for organizations overall. A few factors play \\ninto this, including a perception that iOS is generally more secure. The wide breadth of available \\nAndroid devices makes enforcement of security policies even more difficult. The ability for \\nmanufacturers to take the Android Open Source Project and modify it to their own needs makes \\nthe update cycle unpredictable for businesses [9] [10]. Telecom approval for Android updates \\nadds to the delay of operating system security updates. This is a known global issue and is being \\naddressed in Android 8.0 (Oreo) through Project Treble [11]which makes the upgrade process \\neasier regardless of device manufacturer and carrier. Finally, organizational device owners did \\nnot want to lose access to familiar iOS ecosystem components (such as iMessage). This \\nfamiliarity and user experience appeared to be the most qualitative factor behind purchasing \\ndecisions. In contrast, the Android platform was more customizable for those organizations and \\nindividuals with the skills to modify the operating system directly. 2.3 Mobile Threat Landscape \\nThe Practice Guide broadly speaks of threats and vulnerabilities that the portable nature of \\nmobile devices presents to an organization. Threats such as mobile malware, stolen devices, and \\neavesdropping are mapped to technology solutions used within each architecture. The Practice \\nGuide recognizes that vulnerabilities can occur not only within the operating system but also \\nwithin third-party developer applications and device firmware. The Practice Guide addresses \\nvulnerabilities found in third-party developer applications, whereas operating system and \\nfirmware vulnerabilities were deemed out of scope for the Practice Guide. \\nIn the course of this research, MITRE has attempted to ascertain unique threats in the Australian \\ncontext that would require modifications to the current Practice Guide. We primarily consulted \\nthe NIST Mobile Threat Catalogue (MTC), an online resource that describes, identifies, and \\nstructures the threats posed to mobile information systems [12]. Each entry in the MTC contains \\nseveral pieces of information: an identifier, a category, a high-level description, details on its \\norigin, exploit examples, common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) examples, possible \\ncountermeasures, and academic references. The threats identified within the MTC align with the \\nthreats identified in the ASDs Protection Profile for Mobile Device Fundamentals, which \\nprovides security requirements for the evaluation of IT products. Thus, the threat landscape is \\nlargely the same as what is experienced in the United States (lost devices, malware, ransomware, \\netc.) [12]. \\nAdditionally, device owners expressed concerns that indicated security is still viewed as an \\nobstacle to usability. This can lead to undesirable behavior where end users attempt to disable \\nsecurity controls to accomplish business tasks. Those organizations aware of the importance of \\ncybersecurity remain concerned about the onerous nature of technical activities necessary to \\nimplement mobile device security controls. In particular, SMEs tend to focus on day-to-day \\nbusiness operations and have little time to think about security. One way to address that \\nchallenge is to include stories and/or infographics to SMEs that identify risks posed by the use of \\nmobile devices and how mobile device security impacts them. \\nHowever, there are a few threats worthy of more investigation, including scams that port phone \\nnumbers without device owner consent [13] and phishing attempts designed to trick victims into \\nhanding over valuable personal information such as bank account details and passwords [14]. \\n10 Furthermore, SMEs increasingly need to travel overseas for business and do not often understand \\nthat such travel increases the risks around their mobile device. A good reference point for SMEs \\nis guidance provided by smaller government agencies across the tiers of Australian governments \\non the risks to their staffs, such as the South Australian governments ISMF Guideline 30a on \\nWorking Away from the Office or Abroad. \\nMobile payment methods are an evolving threat vector to monitor in the future, especially for \\nSMEs. External credit card readers such as the Square Reader allow small businesses to accept \\ncredit card payments from a consumer mobile device [15]. Modern versions of these peripherals \\noperate using Bluetooth technology, which is vulnerable to a wide range of attacks, especially if \\nnot configured properly. Organizations should ensure that any external peripheral follows \\nBluetooth best security practices, such as those presented in NISTs Special Publication 800-121 \\nRevision 2 Guide to Bluetooth Security [16]. Approach \\nMITRE followed a four-step process to assess the applicability of the Practice Guide to \\nAustralian organizations: Step 1: MITRE collaborated with AustCyber to identify existing mobile device \\ncybersecurity-related laws, regulations, standards, and guidelines that guide the behavior \\nof Australian organizations (Appendix C). Step 2: Upon review, MITRE selected from the initial list of more than 40 existing laws, \\nstandards, and guidelines to map those identified as most relevant to the guidelines found \\nin the Practice Guide. Step 3: MITRE conducted analysis, including holding on-site consultations with \\nAustralian organizations. These consultations included stakeholders from the Australian \\nfederal and state governments, telecommunications industry, university and research \\ncommunity, industry associations, and SMEs. This research and analysis allowed us to \\ndetermine if the Practice Guide could be adopted as is by Australian organizations",
