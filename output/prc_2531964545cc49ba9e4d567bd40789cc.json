  "text": "strategies should address the \\nevolving needs of the federal workforce 4 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Mission, service, \\nand stewardship \\nrequire commitment, \\nskill, and sustainable \\nengagement 5The MITRE Corporation The Federal Workforce \\nSymposium: sharing \\nexperiences from the private \\nand public sectors The long-term goals defined in the PMA, \\nincluding the workforce goal, require sustained \\npartnership with others outside the federal \\ngovernment By engaging with the private sector, \\nthe government can understand how they are \\naddressing the workforce implications of digital transformation and leverage relevant practices \\nBy partnering with academia and non-profits, the \\ngovernment can research, test, and learn new \\napproaches and determine how best to adopt or \\napply them By collaborating with employees and \\ntheir representatives in labor organizations, the \\ngovernment can address both the needs of those \\npeople and the agency missions they serve These \\nare a few of the persistent actions that the federal \\ngovernment should commit to going forward \\nRecognition of these imperatives is what launched \\nthis effort and the Federal Workforce Symposium To that end, OMB and MITRE, assisted by our \\nprivate sector partner McKinsey and Company, \\nidentified and invited participants from private This is the focus today: to go beyond the idea stage and talk to concrete actions This \\nis your opportunity to make \\nsome recommendations to the \\nfederal government sector organizations in the technology and \\nservices sectors; academia, professional \\nservices; public-interest nonprofits; labor, federal \\ngovernment, and state and local government \\norganizations (See Appendix for a complete list of \\nparticipating organizations ) Session participants \\nrepresented a breadth and depth of experiences \\nand responsibilities for human capital strategy, \\noperations, training, performance management \\nand compensation, technology, talent \\nmanagement, succession planning, civil service \\nlaw, and change management through people To ensure the greatest degree of candor and \\nopenness, the working sessions followed Chatham \\nHouse Rule, with comments and inputs captured \\non a nonattribution basis Participants were highly \\nengaged and produced abundant insights for the \\ngovernment to consider Report Symposium on the Federal Workforce for the 21st Century The changing nature of work: \\nmission, service, stewardship \\nin the digital age This diverse group came together with \\na common interest in supporting a federal \\ngovernment that delivers mission, service, and \\nstewardship Group members all shared the same \\nmacrochallenge: embracing digital transformation \\nand the way it is changing the nature of work, \\nexpectations, and experiences for the workforce \\nThis point was emphasized throughout the \\nsymposium by the various panels in the morning \\nand afternoon working sessions The pace of change and adoption of digital \\ntechnology has accelerated; research and \\nstudy show this will only continue A point made \\nby some speakers and panelists was that the \\ndigital transformation is changing the nature of \\nwork, and organizations face a choice between \\nbeing disrupted or disruptive 1 This is the \\nchoice between allowing technology-driven \\ntransformation to impact organizations and people \\nin adverse ways (e g , reductions in jobs) or using it as an opportunity to redefine the work and \\ncreate new possibilities for skill and job growth, \\nand new ways for employees to contribute to \\nmission, service, and stewardship As many of the \\npanelists pointed out, this transformation is driving \\nprivate sector organizations and governments to \\nmodernize information technology, democratize \\ndata, and enable the workforce by rethinking the \\nrelationship between people and their work and \\nfocusing more on the employee experience To arrive at a potential set of specific actions \\nthe government should consider taking, the \\ndiscussion at the symposium was framed around \\nfour topics: the relationship between technology \\nand people; the need for upskilling and reskilling \\nto position people to adapt to and grow with the \\nchanging nature of work; rethinking performance \\nmanagement and all its aspects, including \\ncompensation; and needed reforms to modernize \\nthe civil service One common practice emerged: \\nleading organizations align business and people \\nstrategies so that they consider all the things \\nthat employees value (instead of adhering to the \\ntraditional view that monetary compensation is the Adapted from: Willis Towers Watson, 2018 Our current reality: we must disrupt or be disrupted. The MITRE Corporation primary motivator) The key to retaining satisfied, \\nproductive, engaged employees is the quality of \\nthe employee experience, and experience shows \\nthat engaged employees deliver results As OMB makes decisions about actions and \\npractices to advance the PMA goals, it should \\nensure that they are both business-driven and \\npeople-driven; that those actions and practices \\nfocus on a common sense of purpose and mission; \\nand that they engage employees, stakeholders, \\nand other related parties in that shared purpose \\nand mission About this report\\nThis report captures the ideas around which there was the greatest convergence among \\nparticipants; it does not include every idea or \\nrecommendation raised during the September \\n12 session We applied our judgment and insight \\nto highlight potential actions the government \\ncould consider that (1) represent the collective \\npoint of view, (2) were new to the federal \\ngovernment but had precedent and a degree \\nof successful practice in other organizations, \\nor (3) were backed up by existing third-party \\nresearch and evidence Our objective is to provide \\nrecommendations that could yield substantial \\nimprovement opportunities Participants may \\nnot have all agreed on specific actions, but they \\ngenerally agreed that action was required Based \\non our analysis of participants input and our own \\nstudy of the relationship between transformation \\nand workforce management, we also developed \\na framework that OMB might consider using to \\norganize and focus future discussions (See Figure \\n1 in What We Learned) Technology is the enabler, but its the humansits uswho \\nare most important 7 8 \\n WHAT WE LEARNED \\nSymposium participants recognized the broad scope of federal workforce development as a \\ntopic for discussion and problem-solving; their \\ndiscussions converged around the three core \\nchallenges we have highlighted in this section. \\nWhile this convergence does not encompass \\nall of the governments workforce challenges, \\nwe believe the three noted below are among \\nthe most fundamental and significant for OMB \\nand its partners and stakeholders to achieve its \\ngoals. Successfully addressing these challenges \\nwould improve mission delivery, enable more \\neffective and efficient service, and strengthen the \\nstewardship of public funds. Challenges \\nAligning workforce strategies to keep \\npace with the changing nature of work Human resource functions support organizations \\nand their mission. Yet, across all sectors, HR faces \\na recurring challenge: balancing continuity, consis-\\ntency, and repeatable processes with the agility to \\nanticipate and adapt their workforce planning and \\ndevelopment strategies to changing environments \\nand requirements. This is a significant challenge \\nfor the federal government, given the scope and \\ncomplexity of its work, its large and diversely skilled \\nworkforce, and the ever-increasing volume and \\nvelocity of technological advancements. The rapidly \\nincreasing accessibility of new technology, meth-\\nods, and data change the nature of work, who does \\nit, and what skills and tools are required. An agile workforce strategy relies on access to \\ndatathe right dataand the ability to continually \\nanalyze that data to inform near-real-time work-\\nforce decisions. Data about emerging conditions, \\ndemand, and other needs that will affect workload \\nwill alter the nature of the work. This environ-\\nmental and operational data must be analyzed \\nin conjunction with workforce-specific data. At There are a lot of levels and \\ndimensions to this problem . \\nWe spend so much time \\nreacting versus being more \\nproactive . We dont take the \\ntime to envision the future \\nand share that future . Report Symposium on the Federal Workforce for the 21st Century 9The MITRE Corporation present, some of the data required to do this type \\nof critical workforce planning is not collected, \\nsynthesized, or shared at an agency- or govern-\\nment-wide level Symposium participants noted that without data \\non the distribution of current workforce skills, \\nleaders can not make evidence-based decisions \\nFor example, data could inform shifting resources \\nto deploy the right skills to address emerging \\nneeds, where to apply training investments, and \\nwhich incentives are most valued by employees \\nNor does the current workforce strategy allow \\nfor operational agility (i e , some degree of excess \\ncapacity), which also inhibits effective resource \\nrealignment, mobilization, and redeployment when \\nthere is a surge in the need for critical skills Sustaining sufficient investment to \\nattract talent and develop skills for \\ndigital transformation and mission Most participants, regardless of sector, said \\nthat their organizations faced the challenge of \\ncompeting for people with skills that are in high-\\ndemand (e g , cybersecurity, data science) They \\nobserved that these sought-after employees have \\nmany employment options and will make choices \\nabout where to work based on their perceptions of \\nwhat they will learn, what they can contribute, and \\nhow their employer will value their contributions Participants also acknowledged this is a significant \\nchallenge for the government Many professionals \\nhave expectations they perceive as inconsistent \\nwith what the government offers in terms of \\ncareer experiences, professional development, \\nwork environment, and rewards Todays early- and \\nmid-career professionals seek less hierarchy, the \\nopportunity to have multiple experiences with \\nthe same employer, and the freedom to apply \\ntheir skills to diverse, meaningful challenges \\nConstraints on upward and lateral career mobility \\nextend the perception that government service \\nis less desirable than employment in the private \\nsector As one",
