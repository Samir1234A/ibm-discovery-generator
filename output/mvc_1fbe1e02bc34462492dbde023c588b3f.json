  "text": "    \"text\": \" 'Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-3379' Engineer Embraces Design Thinking as a Framework for Problem-Solving\\nAwais Sheikh was the first member of his family to grow up in America. Experiencing a culture in the \\noutside world that was very different from the culture inside his home, he sought out ways to embrace \\nthe best of both cultures. This skill proved valuable in his engineering career as he began exploring \\nhuman-centered design as a complement to classical systems engineering. \\\"My stories and experience, as well as listening to other people's stories, makes me a better engineer,\\\" \\nSheikh says. \\\"The more we understand people and their experiences, the better equipped we are to \\naddress the complex issues facing our country.\\\" Awais recent focus has been exploring business innovation methods to apply within MITRE and at \\nsponsor agencies, including lean startup and design thinking. \\\"Design thinking\\\" is an approach that \\nhelps us better understand people's stories, Sheikh says. He describes design thinking as \\\"living in a \\nproblem domain for a while, exploring the problem from the user's experience, and understanding \\nwhat their needs are.\\\" \\\"It's a holistic and responsive approach that helps us solve the kinds of the kinds of complex problems \\nthat MITRE tackles for our government sponsors.\\\" Bringing Award-Winning Skills to MITRE Sheikh's early experiences primed him to look for ways to combine design thinking alongside traditional \\nsystems engineering. After earning a degree in business information technology from Virginia Tech, he \\nworked for various management and information technology consulting firms. During this time, he \\ngained valuable experience in technology management and applying agile methods to government \\nprojects. While working full-time, Sheikh also returned to Virginia Tech and earned an MBA. Armed with his new \\ndegree and his earlier successes applying agile methods and design thinking to government projects, \\nSheikh joined MITRE in 2012. He wasn't the first in his family to take that step30 years earlier his \\nfather joined MITRE. \\\"The fact that my father worked at MITRE didn't sway my decision to join the company,\\\" Sheikh says. \\n\\\"But over the years, my father talked about how MITRE differs from for-profit companies by working in \\nthe public interest. I wanted to be part of that mission.\\\" Design Thinking Achieves Innovative Outcomes \\\"Design thinking involves observing the problem and its effects in context,\\\" Sheikh says. \\\"Then you start \\nbrainstorming, conceptualizing, developing, and rapidly prototyping possible solutions.\\\" Among other projects, Sheikh led a team in MITREs first empirical study of applying design thinking in a \\nfederal context. \\\"The government wanted formal research to confirm the benefits of using design \\nthinking and turned to MITRE because of our expertise and objectivity,\\\" he says. \\\"We developed \\nresearch and methodology for empirically demonstrating the outcomes of a design-thinking approach.\\\" His team's work has been featured at conferences and in journals, including the 2018 Academy of \\nManagement Annual Conference. https://www.mitre.org/capabilities/acquisition-effectiveness/acquisition-initiatives/agile-acquisition\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/publications/project-stories/applying-design-thinking-to-boost-federal-agency-problem-solving\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/publications/project-stories/applying-design-thinking-to-boost-federal-agency-problem-solving\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/publications/project-stories/applying-design-thinking-to-boost-federal-agency-problem-solving\\nhttps://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/AMBPP.2018.74\\nhttps://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/AMBPP.2018.74\\nhttps://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/AMBPP.2018.74\\nhttps://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/AMBPP.2018.74\\nhttps://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/AMBPP.2018.74\\nhttps://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/AMBPP.2018.74 'Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-3379' While at MITRE, Sheikh and his colleagues have applied design thinking methods for various internal \\nefforts and sponsor projects. In one, they took a \\\"big picture\\\" view and employed design thinking to \\nanalyze the current tools, the actual users of these tools, and the problems end users want these tools \\nto solve. As a result, MITRE developed a large-scale modernization solution that will result in faster, \\nmore efficient services, such as issuing identity and travel credentials. Empowering Early Career Professionals Serving as the business innovation capability lead at MITRE, Sheikh advocates design thinking as a \\nframework for problem solving. \\\"Design thinking enables MITRE and our government sponsors to \\napproach old, stubborn problems in new ways and find long-term, sustainable solutions.\\\" Sheikh is also passionate about mentoring early career researchers at MITRE. He serves as a role model \\nby speaking with new hires and junior staff about innovation in an engineering context. His achievements, both technical and professional, have not gone unnoticed. Sheikh was recently \\nnominated for a 2019 Becoming Everything You Are (BEYA) award, which promotes diversity by \\nrecognizing engineers of color who have made achievements and accomplishments in science, \\ntechnology, engineering, and math (STEM). --by Lisa Pacitto https://www.mitre.org/careers/working-at-mitre/professional-development\\nhttps://intouch.ccgmag.com/page/beya_stem_conf2\\nhttps://intouch.ccgmag.com/page/beya_stem_conf2\\nhttps://intouch.ccgmag.com/page/beya_stem_conf2\\nhttps://intouch.ccgmag.com/page/beya_stem_conf2\\nhttps://intouch.ccgmag.com/page/beya_stem_conf2 _top\\n _GoBack \",",
