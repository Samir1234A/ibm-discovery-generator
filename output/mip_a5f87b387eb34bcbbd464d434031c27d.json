  "text": "\\nchain threats?\\nMitigating existing and known threats is a good start to protect against the latest supply \\nchain threats. However, the adversaries will continue to evolve new tactics and techniques xxxii that take advantage of new technologies. Adopting flexible design and engineering \\ndecisions will help operators and system engineers better support and defend the system \\nthroughout its operational sustainment. For each acquistion phase these three questions and a sample set of answers are listed below to \\ndemonstrate how to apply this mindset to develp mitiations using the Multi-level Domain \\nCampus WLAN Capability and attacks (Section 1, Figure 4). Operations and Support6.4.1\\nIn the Operations & Support phase, the full mission system, including our WLAN capability is \\ndeployed and fully operational. The system is being actively used by users and is under attack by \\nadversaries. The major supply chain threats come from changes to the system by way of \\nconfiguration changes, security patches, feature additions, and technology refresh cycles. At this \\npoint, there are no changes to the tech baseline and the supply chain adversary should have \\nsufficient knowledge of the architecture, including hardware and software vendors, versions, and \\nconfigurations.\\nTable 3 contains sample answers to the question of which supply chain threats pose the biggest \\nmission risks during the Operations and Support phase. Table 3. Supply Chain Threats and the Associated Mission Risks (Operations and Support) Supply Chain Threat Mission Risk\\nModified configurations and software Management Services, Authentication Services impacts mission risk across confidentiality, integrity, \\nand availability vectors Compromised end user wireless devices and \\nVPN client software Large integrity and confidentiality risk for the \\ndomains and data they are permitted to access Modified configurations and software Red-side IPS/IDS impacts mission risk across \\nconfidentiality and availability Modified configurations or software on the \\nVPN Gateway Mission confidentiality (using less secure channels) \\nand availability Modifications to configurations and \\nfirmware/software for grey-side Network, \\nGateway, and Firewall devices Mission availability Limited updates to firmware and hardware \\nthreat likelihood Minor impact on mission risk Table 4 contains sample answers to the question of how to improve the mission system to \\nmitigate the most damaging supply chain attacks and compromises during the Operations and \\nSupport phase. Table 4. Mitigating the Impact of Supply Chain Attacks and Compromises on the Mission System \\n(Operations and Support) Cyber Resiliency \\nTechnique Application Substantiated Integrity Preserve the integrity and provenance of the configuration and \\nsoftware to mitigate most of the risk Substantiated Integrity in Adopt two-person configuration change authority. Implement xxxiii combination with Privilege \\nRestriction processes to require at least two different user authorizations before \\nsoftware and configuration changes become operational Substantiated Integrity in \\ncombination with \\nconfiguration and change \\nmanagement solutions Leverage triple entry accounting [19] approaches to provide integrity-\\nassured change management. Approaches include blockchain and \\ncertain distributed version management, which can be combined with \\ndigital signatures to provide a cryptographically tamperproof chain of \\ncustody for soft assets Substantiated Integrity in \\ncombination with \\nRedundancy Version control assets as virtual machine (VM) images. Do change \\nmanagement over the entire asset as a VM, multiple versions of a VM \\ncan be simultaneously supported, allowing for staged, incremental \\nrollouts as well as efficient rollback to minimize impacts from malicious \\nsupply chain injects or substitutions Substantiated Integrity in \\ncombination with \\nRealignment Tailor V&V efforts. Identify unique and comprehensive functional and \\noperational verification & validation (V&V) approaches specific for the \\nmission system and perform testing before deploying anything to \\nproduction. Every mission system should have a testing facility that can \\naccurately simulate operational conditions. Tests should examine \\nfunctionality, minimizing updates impact on integrity or availability, as \\nwell as the baseline performance, and aiding in counterfeit \\nidentification. By policy, all new and modified hardware, firmware, \\nsoftware, or configuration changes should be thoroughly tested in such \\na facility before being approved for operational use Segmentation Isolate software execution. Segment the OS from the hardware and \\nfirmware through virtualization and hypervisors. Use application \\ncontainers or other execution sandboxes to contain execution impact \\nand minimize the ability for supply chain implants to establish and \\nmaintain footholds Privilege Restriction: Constrain Resource Usage. Placing limits on software resource usage \\nlimits an adversarys effectiveness as well as the overall adverse impact \\na software supply chain implant could have Diversity Consider alternatives to traditional security patching. If an attacker can \\ninfiltrate an upstream software vendor, their biggest challenge becomes \\nhow to move the compromised software into the target environment. \\nLeveraging security patching is one method. Instead of immediately \\napplying new security patches, consider the need for the patch and \\npotential alternative methods for detection and mitigation (e.g., \\ndisabling noncritical features, IDS/IPS signatures) Analytic Monitoring Monitor performance. While the Operation & Sustainment phase is late \\nfor adapting design or improving mission system flexibility, supply chain \\nimplants will consume some resources and affect performance or data \\nintegrity. By monitoring historical performance characteristics across \\nresources, certain types of implants may be detectable (e.g., grey \\nmarket, time bombs) Coordinated Defense Adopt proven SCRM controls. Follow supply chain risk management [5] \\nand physical protection [20] guidance to sustain provenance integrity \\nand decrease chances of compromise during operations xxxiv Table 5 provides sample answers to the question of how to improve the recovery of and evolve \\nthe capability of the mission system against future supply chain attacks during the Operations \\nand Support phase.\\nTable 5. Improving Recovery and Evolution of the Capability Against Future Supply Chain Threats (Operations and Support) Cyber Resiliency \\nTechnique Application Adaptive \\nResponse, Dynamic \\nRepresentation Monitor (supply chain) threat landscape. Continually monitor the threat \\nlandscape and update processes, detection, and countermeasures for potential \\nadverse supply chain tactics, techniques, and protocols (TTPs) against current or \\npotential vendors and suppliers as well as similar technologies or components, \\nwhich may be applied against current or future supply chain channels Realignment Take advantage of refresh and Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) cycles. \\nMinor improvements can be made through technology refresh cycles and \\nsimilar point upgrades by migrating towards products that support common \\nindustry standards, allowing for future flexibility Production and Deployment6.4.2\\nDuring the Production & Development phase, the mission system architecture has been finalized \\nand the various hardware and software components are being mass produced per specifications. \\nThe components are being delivered to the organization and being integrated and tested to ensure \\nthe composite system meets functionality and operational requirements. A supply chain \\nadversary could tamper with the production and delivery, potentially injecting or modifying \\ncomponents. This is the adversarys opportune time to compromise commercial (non-custom) \\nhardware.\\nTable 6 contains sample answers to the question of which supply chain threats pose the biggest \\nmission risks during the Production and Deployment phase. Table 6. Supply Chain Threats and the Associated Mission Risks (Production and Deployment) Supply Chain Threat Mission Risk\\nModified software for Management Services, and \\nAuthentication Services Risks across confidentiality, integrity, and \\navailability vectors Compromised end user wireless devices and VPN \\nclient software Large integrity and confidentiality risk for \\nthe domains and data they are permitted to \\naccess Modified software to the red-side IPS/IDS Compromises mission confidentiality and \\navailability Modified software on the VPN Gateway Compromises mission confidentiality (using \\nless secure channels) and availability Modified grey-side Network, Gateway, and Firewall \\nhardware, firmware, and software Risk mission availability Configuration is not a concern as that is done primarily \\nduring integration at the start of the O&S phase N/A xxxv Table 7 contains sample answers to the question of how to improve the mission system to \\nmitigate the most damaging supply chain attacks and compromises during the Production and \\nDeployment phase.
