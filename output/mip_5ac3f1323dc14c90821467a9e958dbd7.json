  "text": "ICS security standards and best practices is to improve the \\noverall security of the data, networks, and critical infrastructure. ICS security standards: Defines both functional and assurance requirements Cover a broad range of granularity Addresses the users need, but also is practical since cost and technological \\nlimitation need to be considered ICS security best practices: Are the foundation of technical security standards. Recognizes the people who develop, integrate, evaluate, configure, \\nmaintain, and use the technology are critical for safeguarding the critical \\ninfrastructure Can be used to conduct in-house security assessments\\n | 37 | ICS Security Guidelines and Best Practices\\nOverview Part II Things to consider: There are many classification systems and organizations that develop technical \\nsecurity standards, it is important to adopt a standard that fits your \\norganizations needs Organizations should adopt standards and best practices to reduce risk and \\nminimize cost, damage, risk in lieu of an impactful event Standards and best practices help develop ICS defense-in-depth strategies Adopted ICS Standards & Best Practices Organizations: ANSI: American National Standards Institute ISA: International Society of Automation IEC: International Electrotechnical Commission NIST: National Institute of Standards and Technology ICS-CERT: Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team\\n | 38 | ANSI/ISA 62443-3-3 Provides detailed technical control system requirements (SRs) associated with \\nthe seven foundational requirements (FRs) described in ISA-62443-1-1 \\n(99.01.01) Defines guidance for ICS system security requirements and security levels The SR normative language states that the control system shall provide \\ncapability to to support some support some specific security requirement. | 39 | ANSI/ISA 62443-4-2 Provides the cybersecurity technical requirements for components that make \\nsup an Industrial Automation and Control System (IACS). The standard provides security capabilities that enable a component to mitigate \\nthreats for a given security level (without compensating remediation strategies) 62443-4-2 simplifies the procurement and integration processes for the various \\nnetwork enabled devices that make up an ICS/SCADA environment | 40 | NIST 800-82 Special Publication rev II NIST 800-82 SP rev II is a best practice guidance document on how to secure \\nICS, SCADA, DCS, systems, while addressing the following: Overview of ICS System topologies Threats Vulnerabilities Performance Reliability Safety Requirements Provides recommended security countermeasures to associated risks | 41 | ICS-CERT Recommended Practices ICS-CERT recommended practices (RP) provides state of the art Defense-in-\\nDepth strategies for security ICS networks and infrastructure The RPs are catered towards organizations that are: In the process of developing defense and mitigation strategies Learning to prepare for ongoing and emerging ICS cyber issues, \\nvulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies The ICS-CERT team works with control system subject matter experts (SMEs) to \\nensure the RPs are publicly available and have been vetted The documents include, but not limited to: Updating Antivirus in an Industrial Control System Good Practice Guide for Firewall Deployment on \\nSCADA and Process Control Networks Improving ICS Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth \\nStrategies Cross-Site Scripting Creating Cyber Forensics Plans for Control Systems Patch Management for Control Systems Developing an Industrial Control Systems \\nCybersecurity Incident Response Plan Securing Control System Modems\\nRemote Access for Industrial Control Systems | 42 | Lessons Learned There are many entities, boards, and sectors that have ICS security \\nstandards and best practices It is important to identify your organizations security needs before \\nadopting to a ICS security standard and/or best practice Identify Pros and Cons of each ICS security standard and/or best \\npractice Organizations could also utilize ICS security standards and best practices \\nfor risk management and in-house security assessments | 43 | ICS Security Considerations | 44 | ICS Security Considerations\\nOverview As more ICS network enabled functionality, innovation, and optimization \\ntechniques increases, so will the adversarial threat and attack vectors Organizations should not rely on adversaries to expose their ICS risks and \\nassociated vulnerabilities due to: Health and safety concerns Time and cost for remediation Reputation and Reliability concerns Physical and digital damage Organizations should adopt vetted security considerations and continuously \\nupdate due to international cyber threat | 45 | Cybersecurity Culture Cyber security is currently an ongoing dynamic culture The idea is to make cyber security an integral part of the organizations life The culture encompasses: Knowledge How much information/data do you know about your system? Beliefs What cyber security strategies are you adopting towards? Attitudes Do you care about X,Y,Z vulnerabilities, threats, and risks? Values What entities are impactful? How should we defend and secure them? knowledge beliefs attitudes values | 46 | ICS Asset Configuration/Management\\nPart I Configuration Management (CM) is policies and procedures for controlling \\nmodifications to hardware, firmware, software, and documentation to ensure \\nthe information system is protected against improper modifications prior to, \\nduring, and after system implementation Lack of CM can lead to unmanageable and highly vulnerable inventory of \\nhardware, firmware, and software Before CM strategies are in place, the organization should categorize ICS \\nsystems and network assets (NIST SP 800-83 rev II {Section 4.5.1}) this \\nincludes: Focusing on systems rather than just devices (PLCs, DCS, SCADA, HMIs, \\nshould be considered) Assets that use routable protocols or dial-up services should be documented Reviewing asset list annually (addition and removal) | 47 | ICS Asset Configuration/Management\\nPart II Configuration management policies and procedures are used to control \\nmodifications to hardware, firmware, software, and documentation Ensure that the ICS system is protected against improper modifications prior \\nto, during, and after system implementation. The security controls that fall within the NIST SP 800-53 CM family provide \\npolicy and procedures for establishing baseline controls for information \\nsystems. Controls are also specified for maintaining, monitoring, and documenting\\nconfiguration control changes. A formal change management program should be established to insure that all \\nmodifications to an ICS network meet the same security requirements as the \\noriginal components identified in the asset evaluation, associated risk \\nassessment, and mitigation plans | 48 | ICS Asset Configuration/Management\\nPart III Supplemental Guidance: NIST SP 800-70: Provides guidance on configuration settings for IT products NIST SP 800-100: Provides guidance on information security governance and planning NIST SP 800-128: Provides guidance on implementation of a security-focused configuration management \\nprogram | 49 | ICS Architecture When designing a network architecture for an ICS deployment, it is usually \\nrecommended to separate the ICS network from the corporate network (NIST \\nSP 800-83 rev II {Section 5}) The nature of network traffic on these two networks is different: Internet \\naccess, FTP, email, and remote access will typically be permitted on the \\ncorporate network but should not be allowed on the ICS network If ICS network traffic is carried on the corporate network, it could be intercepted \\nor be subjected adversarial based attacks or recon Items that should be considered when designing a hardened ICS architecture \\nare the following: Network Segmentation and Segregation Boundary Protection (Physical Security) Firewalls | 50 | ICS Security Controls It is often difficult or infeasible to apply security controls todays ICS because of \\nthe following: Use of a combination of legacy systems Planned life span of 20-30 years Hybrid of legacy systems (augmented with newer hardware and software\\nthat are interconnected to other systems) The NIST SP 800-53 controls are organized into 18 families; each family \\ncontains security controls related to the general security topic of the family. Security controls may involve aspects of policy, oversight, supervision, \\nmanual processes, actions by individuals, or automated mechanisms \\nimplemented by information systems/devices | 51 | ICS Monitoring Legacy and modern ICS devices are usually supplied with physical and \\nvirtual interfaces that can be tapped for situational awareness Monitoring on a real-time basis where feasible is a great factor for incident \\nresponse, analysis, and knowing the health state of the ICS environment There are many techniques for monitoring ICS environments. The following are \\nsome items to consider: Tap physical and virtual network socket sensors Log authentication attempts/denial Monitor inflow/outflow packet transaction anomalies Use Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) Use Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) | 52 | ICS Network Access Control Proper firewall and network configuration rules should be in place and \\nconsistently maintained and monitored to decrease the risk of network based \\ncyber attacks ICS network access control can be achieved by: Leverage ICS architecture to separate and protect network zones Encryption of communication and logical isolation Control and filtering of traffic Supported authentication tactics for leverage ICS equipment | 53 | ICS HMI and Workstation Security Typically this strategy involves hardening the various Human Machine \\nInterfaces (HMIs), Open Platform Communications (OPCs), and other remote \\nclients used to connect and configure the ICS devices The various remote devices need to be: Locked Down by utilizing the functionality provided by the Operating \\nSystem (OS). If there is weak security functionality in place, consider other \\nupdated supported tools. Tested to ensure the security changes still allow for communications to the \\nICS devices Verified to confirm no serious security holes (vulnerabilities) are left open by \\nthe hardening process | 54 | Supply Chain A supply chain attack is an intentional malicious action (insertion, substitution, \\nor modification) taken to covertly exploit a vulnerability in the ICS development \\nlifecycle The Information and Communications Technology (ICT) supply chain is defined \\nin NIST 800- 161 as a linked set of resources and processes between",
