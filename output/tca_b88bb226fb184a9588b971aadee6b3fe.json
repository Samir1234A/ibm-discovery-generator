MITRE staff confirmed that excessive traffic xxii levels were used to push the limits of Sector 93 arrival management. Pilot Feedback4.8\\nThere were two pilots controlling one flight each with the FMS simulator and two pseudo pilots \\neach controlling multiple RTA flights in each of the HITL simulation runs. Q1 and Q2 of the \\npilot survey were only applicable to the former. The rest, Q3 to Q5, were applicable to all the \\npilots. Averaged scores for the FMS simulator and pseudo pilots are reported in Figure 15 and \\nFigure 16, respectively. A high level of agreement to a question indicates that the survey \\nparticipant found the concept useful or operationally acceptable. Strongly Disagree Disagree Neutral Agree Strongly Agree Average Likert Scale FMS Pilot Response Figure 15. Average FMS Pilot Scores As can be seen in Figure 15,the FMS FAA Certified ATPL pilots rated Q1 (the straightforward \\nability to program the FMS for an en route RTA for TBFM extended metering) the highest \\npossible score. They also rated high Q2 and Q3, related to the straightforward monitoring of RTA \\noperation, both with a score of 4. Q4 (the assessment of the workload necessary to operate RTAs \\nfor TBFM extended metering versus current practice) scored the lowest. Finally, they more than \\nagreed with the assessment of the usefulness of RTA operation in Q5. xxiii Strongly Disagree Disagree Neutral Agree Strongly Agree Average Likert Scale Pseudo Pilot Response Figure 16. Average Pseudo Pilot Scores Figure 16 shows that the pseudo pilots scored Q3, Q4, and Q5 the same as the FMS pilots. \\nReiterating the usefulness of RTAs for TBFM extended metering operations. Pilots Qualitative Results4.9\\nPilots remarks and comments were collected in the final part of the survey. A summary of the \\nremarks from the FMS pilots are presented below. Reported that he/she did not monitor the speed changes that the FMS was using to \\nachieve the STA with the RTA function. He/she trusted the automation. Reported that using the RTA instead of a speed requires slightly more manipulation \\non the FMS. Reported that a six-digit number for the STA was hard to hear, commenting that if the \\nclearance was unexpected, this format could be confusing for pilots. Also \\nacknowledged that this could be a personal issue and that could be mitigated once the \\nRTAs become more commonly used. xxiv Summary and Conclusions5\\nThe part-task HITL evaluation presented in this paper was focused on the use of integrated Path \\nStretch and RTA clearances in the cruise extended metering environment. The low RTA \\ncancellation rate and the positive feedback from the controller and pilot questionnaires collected \\nshowed the operational feasibility of the TBM-RTA ConOps. Moreover, the higher delivery \\naccuracy at the meter point achieved by the RTA flights demonstrated that, at least in cruise, the \\nfunctionality can provide a benefit. Lastly, the relatively low speed adjustments implemented by \\nthe FMS RTA to achieve the higher delivery accuracy allowed the controllers to monitor RTA \\nflights with several minor improvements to the information already provided by the displays that \\nthey currently use. \\nThe HITL simulation operational scenarios were designed to put excess stress on the extended \\nmetering operation to test the functional integration of the Path Stretch, RTA, and GIM-S meet-\\ntime advisories. As a result, controllers were managing traffic that was workload-intensive at \\ntimes. This caused the controller in sector 93 to occasionally intervene and issue speed and/or \\nvector clearances to flights before handing off to sector 39. Controllers recognized that these \\nspeeds and/or vectors were necessary because of the higher than normal traffic represented in the \\nsimulation. \\nAnother finding related to the higher than normal traffic during the evaluation is that, in a dense \\ntraffic environment, even if aircraft meet their STA perfectly, there could be some separation \\nissues after crossing the meter point. For example, if consecutive aircraft cross the meter point at \\ndifferent speeds, even if perfectly separated at the meter point meeting their STA, post-crossing \\nspacing can decrease to levels that are uncomfortable to the controllers. Therefore, the necessity \\nto apply speed control to several aircraft by the receiving controller in sector 39 was observed \\noccasionally during the HITL simulation. 6 xxv Next Steps7\\nWhile the HITL simulation showed that the TBM-RTA concept is operationally feasible, \\nadditional studies need to be conducted to assess the benefits of using RTA for en route extended \\nmetering versus the use of GIM-S advisories. A key focus of future studies will be whether the \\nhigher delivery accuracy achieved by RTA flights translates into benefits such as increased \\nthroughput or reduced delays. \\nThe HITL simulation also demonstrated the feasibility of the ConOps in extended metering in en \\nroute cruise, but questions remain about the feasibility during the en route descent phase for \\nmetering to the TRACON. Greater RTA performance uncertainty is expected when aircraft \\naltitude changes occur, and the results of this HITL simulation cannot be directly extended to that \\ntype of operation. Managing RTA flights that are metering and transitioning across multiple \\nsectors should also be explored, as this was not studied in this HITL simulation. \\nAnother important issue that needs to be validated is the use of more realistic wind forecast errors \\nbetween the TBFM system and the FMS. MITRE expects the benefits of RTA over GIM-S to be \\nhigher in actual operations where the wind prediction accuracy is lower than what was modeled \\nfor the evaluation.\\nA key next step is to study a more realistic depiction of arrival traffic flows. The HITL simulation \\nconducted included higher than normal traffic levels operating in an arrival flow corridor which \\ncreated some unexpected challenges, previously described. It would be desirable to simulate \\ntraffic over a four cornerpost environment to allow TBFM to provide more balanced traffic \\ndemand loading via the schedule. xxvi Acknowledgments8\\nMITRE CAASD would like to express our thanks to Guillermo Sotelo, Kerry Capes, and Rob \\nHunt from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) who provided valuable input to help guide \\nthis research.
