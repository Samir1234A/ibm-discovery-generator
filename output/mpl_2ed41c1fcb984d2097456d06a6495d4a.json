  "sdl_extracted_summary": "in hindsight [35] both as part of Defence market testing \\nand acceptance into initial service. If major capabilities outsource conduct of developmental and acceptance testing, \\nsafety assessments, usability trials and operating procedures to a contractor without adequate residential project staff \\nand representative operators present, then the transfer of risk and delay in resolving risk is contrary to the very intent of \\nthe project in giving these tasks to the contractor in the first place [5], [28], [32]. If the French Naval Group undertake significant portions of Australias submarine systems virtual, constructive and \\nlive simulation testing in France, significant Knowledge Transfer issues will make the flow of test results much harder. \\nSimilarly, if Lockheed Martin undertake the simulation testing of their submarine systems in the U.S., there are risks to \\ntest results making it unfettered to the stakeholders, especially if they were to use proprietary simulation models that \\nhave not been accredited by the U.S. and/or Australian DoD(s). Constraints on travel budgets hampered representation \\nof operators and technical experts on Australias Landing Helicopter Dock ship during safety and usability assessments \\nand that program only involved travel within Australia [32], [35], much less than would be the case for Cherbourg, \\nFrance and Rhode Island, U.S.. Cybersecurity assessments for cooperative vulnerability and penetration testing further \\nchallenge outsourcing of such work without close cooperation between the DoD and contractors [29], [36]. Work by \\nFowler et al. [37] shows there are extant Australian DoD practices like systems safety that can be leveraged to \\ncooperate with industry in independent cybersecurity, provided these practices are being followed and not overly \\noutsourced. Also, Joiner and Tutty [16] outline U.S. DoD initiatives to efficiently manage independent cybersecurity \\ntesting through distributed simulation, experimentation exercises and through the test network infrastructure on which \\nthese are based. For Australias Submarine Program, representative land-based test sites across all submarine systems should be \\nin Australia and under Australian DoD control as soon as possible if the design work is to be successfully exported in \\nan enduring way, enable knowledge sovereignty and provide for timely and informed decision making and taking [38]. \\nSuch test sites should significantly de-risk any such submarine program by helping to maintain public support, and \\nenabling fully representative technical and operational participation throughout the rolling complex software-intensive \\nsystems development in safety, usability [39], reliability, maintainability, availability and cybersecurity assessments. \\nCybersecurity has traditionally been considered as one of the ilities with tests focussed on mandatory compliance and \\nresponses to incidents during the operational phase of land-based tests, mostly as a reactive process, rather than for \\ndeveloping social trusts and assurances. Perspectives on how to build security in can establish a common language to \\nuse in designing the software-intensive systems, thus making risk trade-offs throughout projects acquisition lifecycles, \\nminimizing the number of systems vulnerabilities, and reducing time for land-based tests. Moreover, early investment \\nin representative land-based sites can be expected to add some up-front cost to the submarine program because they \\nentail high fidelity virtual and bench-level representations of the submarine systems in progressive upgrade ahead of all \\nfuture boats. As observed by the U.S DOD [27], the return on investment in test infrastructure can drive down acquisition costs, \\nbecause the technical debt, typically incurred because of flawed engineering and deferred testing, can be dramatically \\nreduced. Sovereign controlled land-based test sites will have additional workforce and National Security benefits. Land-\\nbased test infrastructure should provide fertile ground to grow and enhance local cybersecurity workforce. From a \\nNational Security perspective, this infrastructure would enable countries adopt agile, iterative and incremental \\nacquisition and testing approaches that ultimately enhance their sovereign ability to keep pace with adversaries in \\ncyberspace. Despite these lessons learned, land-based test sites like those in Australia are likely to face enormous pressure to be \\nscaled back, as they did on the Collins Program, in favour of foreign test sites and the actual build. Such pressure is \\nlikely to be a system-by-system argument, where for example, propulsion and power systems may get an Australian test \\nsite, but sonar, weapons, combat and communication systems remain foreign. Any such parsing of the submarine 4 systems puts enormous risk on the higher-order aim of any submarine program, on the actual submarines to resolve \\noperational and technical issues in-build and in-the-water rather than beforehand, and to become truly sovereign \\ncapabilities. In developing land-based test sites to enable live, virtual and constructive distributed simulations [16], it is \\ncrucial that the simulations are accredited for intended use, as is required in the U.S. Do D [40]. While such \\naccreditation seems a significant non-recurring expense, if the complex adaptive software elements and \\ninterconnectedness of the submarine exhibits emergent properties, as many modern defence systems are, then the quid \\npro quo of the test sites will be the wherewithal to begin software verification much earlier and continue that into life as \\ndetailed by Hecht [41], Normann [42] , and Cofer [43]. CYBER WARFARE THREAT AND OPPORTUNITYV.\\nCyber is becoming the cheap first-strike weapon of political choice by potential adversaries in a kind of merging of insurgency, terrorism, international crime and state-based influences [44]. The merging of electronic warfare and cyber-\\nwarfare means that no platform, however unconnected or firewalled it may be, is immune to probing within its systems \\n[14], [19]. A future submarine must not only survive and be credible in this Information Age, but actually ought to be a \\npotential purveyor of offensive cyber like that described by the Australian Prime Minister [12], so that it remains a \\ncontemporary deterrence. Cyber first and foremost is connected to the socio, meaning interfering with the socio-functioning of the system, for \\nexample by cyber-attacks, creating an instability in the synthetic ecology which interferes with the human psyche; \\ncreating further instability and uncertainty [22]. Sovereign Testing of the entire quantum attack surface is therefore \\nfundamental to Knowledge Transfer and cybersecurity, without which countries like Australia would not have \\nKnowledge Sovereignty over their future submarine. Cyber-power is relatively cheap, available and largely anonymous, such that it is attractive for peacetime as it is for \\nwar [45], especially for deterrence by smaller powers in the Asia-Pacific region [44]. These attributes also make cyber-\\npower attractive to non-state actors [13], [46] such as cyber criminals, terrorists, hackers, and proxy actors engaged or \\nsupported by numerous foreign governments [44, p.126], [47, p.5]. Heinl [44] forecasts that within a few years most \\nstates in the Asia-Pacific will develop some form of offensive cyber program , most of whom are also pursuing \\nsubmarine capabilities for deterrence [48]. Few Indo-Pacific countries pursuing these two defence capabilities are likely \\nto have examined the risk of cyber warfare to their new submarine capabilities because it is a delicate and futuristic \\nbalance of defensive and offensive new technologies [48]. While Australia often relies on deterrence by alliances, kinetic military power like that referred to by Hashim [49] \\ncan be unusable in cyber warfare because attribution is slow and difficult [50], [51], [52], cyber-effects are hard to \\ncontain, and the adversaries may be globally dispersed [53]. For Australias major military platforms like the future \\nsubmarine, which are intended to operate throughout the Asia-Pacific region, they are likely to be a cyber-warfare target \\nstarting from the first supply of software-intensive componentry for the test sites. The quantum attack surface for such \\nsubmarine programs are likely to be defined throughout their entire life by resupplies and software updates and every \\ncontractor and subcontractor with access. Defence acquisitions have sought to reduce costs and risks while improving interoperability for coalitions by \\nutilising commercial components, especially computer components and software applications. As such, most defence \\nplatforms probably have a larger cyber-attack surface than they realise [18]. The increased use of commercial hardware \\nand software to perform essential functions for mission critical systems is likely to have increased the vulnerability of \\ncountries like Australia to cyber-threats. Commercial components can be exposed to supply chain attacks as well as \\nmalicious tampering. Because re-use of commercial hardware and software is encouraged by international standards for \\ninteroperability [16], [54], [55], vulnerabilities are even more-likely to be discovered at some stage. Weapons Systems \\nwhich use commercial hardware and software are extensively interconnected with other platforms [17], which increases \\nthe quantum attack surface and cyber risks. Improving the dynamic (as in continuous and ongoing) cyber-resilience of defence platforms has three main threads \\nidentifiable from the U.S. DoD: improved security systems engineering and cybersecurity test and evaluation so as to design and build in cyber-\\nresiliency [14], [15] [27], [29]; trusted cyber supply chains as covered in the next section of this paper [17], [19]; and 5 trusted cyber-security modules or other resident cyber-threat adaptive sub-systems [19], [37].\\nTrusted cyber-threat adaptive modules have been the subject of recent review by the U.S. DoDs Defense Science Board [19], as these offer the ability to preserve cost-effective use of commercial off-the-shelf componentry but \\nmonitor and correct the use of such componentry with Defence-only add-ins to the architecture. The Boards proposal is \\nas follows (p. 93): Further work remains in optimizing methods for hardware- and software-based integrity validation, autonomous \\nassessment of subsystem compromise, and",

  "text": "the likelihood of the \\nevent occurring, the magnitude of the possible penalty equates to the consequence / impact \\nif the event does occur, and the two taken together equate to the level of risk. Voluntary tax \\ncompliance, then, becomes a form of risk mitigation. In reality, however, taxpayers as a whole do not appear to make their compliance decisions \\nsolely based on the likelihood of being examined. While the perceived probability of \\nexamination does seem to impact individual compliance decisions, changes to the overall \\nexamination rate appear to have little or no effect on voluntary compliance overall. \\nIndividual behavior is often consistent with the classical theory, but it is sporadic and does \\nnot appear at the macro or systemic level. In effect, people simply do not break the rules \\nas often as the classical economic deterrence model would predict, even where the risk of \\npunishment is relatively low. So it seems that IRS examination risk (or perhaps \\ncompliance reviews by other agencies) is not the entire motivation in framing an \\nindividuals decision whether to comply. The focus of the classical economic deterrence model is strictly on extrinsic motivation. The \\nmodel implicitly excludes as irrelevant any considerations of justice, fairness and other \\nnonpecuniary (intrinsic) motivators for complianceas well as peer behavior, guilt, \\nshame, and other psychological factors. The model appears to have little or no utility in \\ndefinitively predicting overall taxpayer compliance, but the constituent elements of the \\nmodelthe related threats of examination and fines / penaltiesdo appear to have a \\npredictive relationship with individual compliance behavior. Therefore, these types of \\nactivities should be taken into account in any analysis of taxpayer behavior and considered \\nfor inclusion in any program aimed at motivating taxpayers to comply. 3.1.2 Impacts of the Environment Extrinsic motivation can also derive from the characteristics of the \\nenvironment. For example, the ability to obtain all necessary \\ninformation, and have it presented in clear and straightforward \\nways, better motivates individuals to make good compliance decisions. However, this is not \\nalways the case with government programs. Two examples pertaining to significant \\nprograms with billions of dollars of improper payments each year follow. Accountability officials indicated that the complexity of the Earned Income Tax \\nCredit creates difficulties for IRS in educating the population that claims the credit, \\ndecreasing the motivational benefits of education. In June 2015, GAO testified24 before the House Subcommittee on Social Security, \\nCommittee on Ways and Means, that the Disability Insurance programs work \\nincentive rules are confusing. GAO officials stated that SSA staff interviewed had \\nvarying interpretations of the rules and gave beneficiaries differing instructions. \\n24 DISABILITY INSURANCE Preliminary Observations on Overpayments and Beneficiary Work Reporting (GAO-15-673T, \\nJune 16, 2015) 24 This can lead to variations in the level of compliance motivation among \\nbeneficiaries. Another environmental characteristic that impacts individuals motivation to comply with \\nrequirements is the way a program is structured. In particular, programs that have to \\nwholly or partially rely on beneficiaries self-reporting of life changes, such as a change in \\nincome level or number of dependents, for determination of compliance are at a distinct \\ndisadvantage. Agency officials stated: Many beneficiaries who must self-report life changes are not focused on self-\\nreporting, which complicates agency reliance on it. Frequently reminding \\nbeneficiaries of their self-reporting responsibilities may simply not work. It needs to be easy for individuals to self-report and interact with agencies. For \\nexample, interaction mechanisms need to be tailored to the specific groups with \\nwhich each agency interacts, and potential unintended consequences need to be \\nidentified and considered before making any changes to reporting methodologies. Self-reporting needs to be individual-focused, not agency-focused or program-\\nfocused; for example, it might be advantageous to self-report information to a \\nsingle government point-of-entry, instead of having to report the same information \\nmultiple times across programs or agencies. Another major factor with program structure is how a system such as health care \\nreimburses for items and services. Agency officials indicated this can dictate how unethical \\nand dishonest individuals will exploit the system. The specific anti-fraud measures and \\nprogram safeguards that must be integrated into programs depend on the way that system \\nand its payments are structured. 3.2 Intrinsic Motivation Intrinsic motivation is a person's natural, innate \\nmotivation. Anything that moves a person to do \\nsomething out of pure interest, such as learning to play a \\nsport or creating artwork without being compelled to do \\nso, is an intrinsic motivator. It is the most effective \\npersonal motivator, and because of that, positive long-\\nrange results are more likely from intrinsic motivators \\nthan from extrinsic ones. Finally, extrinsic and intrinsic \\nmotivation can coexist; for example, a person may be extrinsically motivated by high pay in \\nthe workplace but at the same time be more highly motivated by their true enjoyment of \\nthe work. 25 3.2.1 Social Psychology and Tax Morale Social psychology has established that along with extrinsic factors, \\nthere are multiple intrinsic (psychological) factors that can affect \\ntax compliance. Intrinsic or psychological motivators include: Perceived fairness with regard to the tax system and the \\nauthorities administering the system Acceptance of tax evasion among a relevant reference group Perceived tax evasion among friends Sense of self-esteem / self-image Perceived procedural, distributive, or retributive justice25 Building on these motivators, tax morale is a concept developed by social psychology to \\nencompass nonpecuniary motivators for tax compliance as well as factors that fall outside \\nthe standard, expected utility framework (the classical economic deterrence model). \\nSpecific factors in the tax morale concept include: Intrinsic motivation o Paying taxes or feeling guilt or shame for not doing so o Being influenced by peer behavior, including the possibility of social \\nrecognitionor sanctionsfrom peers, in which the willingness to pay taxes \\ndepends on the views or behaviors of other individuals, such as a reluctance to \\ndo something wrong in the eyes of others Reciprocal motivationwillingness to pay taxes in exchange for benefits that \\ngovernment provides even though the pecuniary payoff would be higher by not \\npaying the taxes; it should be noted that behavioral economics suggests that any \\nperceived remoteness of a compulsory payment from its benefit is critical to \\ncompliance considerations Cultural factors, such as corruption, that may affect the willingness to pay taxes Information imperfections and deviations from utility maximization; for example, \\nindividuals may misperceive the probability of being detected when they evade \\ntaxes or may exhibit a systematic bias in their decision-making process such as loss \\naversion Tax authorities often pursue policies that reflect the belief that nonpecuniary factors are \\nimportant in tax compliance decisions. For example, publicity and visibility are often used \\nin both positive and negative ways. Some tax authorities have publicly recognized \\ncompliant or high-payment taxpayers. Alternatively, more than half of U.S. states have or \\n25 Procedural justice concerns fairness of the processes by which decisions are made. Distributive justice refers to fairness \\nin the distribution of rights or resources, while retributive justice refers to fairness in the punishment of wrongs. 26 have had name and shame programs in which the names of top tax debtors are revealed \\npublicly on state websites. Related to these factors, behavioral economics offers additional intrinsic motivators that \\ncan impact an individuals tax compliance decisions. These include: Cost-benefit analysisbalancing the cost of being detected with the benefits of \\nsuccessfully evading payment A libertarian approachThis money belongs to me Alienationpeople may not feel part of a society Resentment of coercionpeople simply do not like to be forced to pay their money \\nin taxes Perception of unfairness vis--vis the obligation to pay taxes, such as the belief that \\nrich individuals do not pay enough taxes Reciprocity / social acceptability of noncompliancein some societies tax evasion is \\nnot considered an intolerable act Perception that Others are not payingwhy should I? Outcome remotenessthe inability to see the effect of noncompliance 3.2.2 Visibility and Accountability Just as with motivating agencies and those that act on their behalf, \\nvisibility and accountability can motivate claimants. In particular, \\nofficials at one agency offered the view that visibility generally \\nimpacts organizations that receive federal funding more so than \\nindividuals; in other words, reputational risk is a more significant issue for organizations. 27 Agency and accountability officials, as well as applied \\nliterature and research, offered a number of actions \\nthat organizations take to promote visibility and \\naccountability in hopes of motivating claimants to be \\naccurate and not make errors or commit fraud. Using compliance activities (such as identity \\nvalidation, penalties, loss of benefit eligibility) to \\nmotivate, balanced with help for claimants when \\nappropriate; leveraging enforcement to increase \\nlevels of claimant responsibility. Informing claimants that their information will \\nbe shared with other agencies for matching. Incorporating accountability clauses in grants to \\nensure grantees awareness of responsibilities. Raising public awareness and providing \\neducation regarding noncompliance penalties\\nensuring these penalties are well known. Naming and shamingbut an agency must \\nhave credible power for this to be of value. Recognizing compliant or high-paying taxpayers \\npublicly as an alternative to shaming tax \\nevaders, a strategy adopted by an increasing \\nnumber of developing countries.
