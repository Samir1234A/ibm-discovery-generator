  "text": "(taking into account the Asw\\nenhancement factor) and agrees with the measured E- field for the CW RF no-noise case. Adding noise causes an increase in the measured E-field, by an amount that depends on the frequency band of the noise, the noise power, and the strength of the CW field under test. For most noise conditions, the measured E-field strengths with noise are larger by some amount when compared to the no-noise case. The highest noise levels (i.e., 0 dB) with Filters 1 and 2 does show a dramatic increase in the AT-splitting and the apparent E-field strength. In actuality, the E-field strength of the coherent signal in the vapor cell has not increased at all. It is only the AT- splitting that has increased due to the noise. This point is further explained by the model presented in the next section. To better illustrate the effect of the noise, Fig. 12 shows the percent difference of the apparent E-field obtained using eq. (2) from the no-noise case versus the coherent- signal-to-noise-power ratio (CSNR). The CSNR is calcu- lated using the CW RF power and the integrated noise power at the input to the horn antenna. We see that above a CSNR of 1, the percent difference approaches zero. Below a CSNR of 1 the effect on the E-field mea- surement strongly depends on the frequency band of the noise. When the noise is red-shifted compared to the RF transition frequency (i.e., Filter 3), the noise primarily broadens the EIT signal, and has less effect on shift- ing the EIT peaks compared to other filters. This will be shown and discussed in more detail in the next ses- sion. Thus, when the noise is red-shifted relative to the RF transition, it has a minimal effect on the ability to measure CW RF E-fields. Even with the strongest noise power (black squares in Fig. 12), the E-field measure- ment is only strongly affected below a CSNR of 0.2. The blue-shifted noise (i.e., Filter 1) has the strongest effect on the E-field measurements. In the Filter 1 case, the E- field measurements significantly differ from the CW RF below a CSNR of 1 and differ by 80% below a CSNR\\nof 0.5. The influence of BLWGN on E-fields measure- ment for the on-resonance case (Filter 2) falls between the red-shifted and blue-shift cases (Filter 1 and Filter 3). The experimental results in Figs. 3 and 7-12 serve to illustrate the typical effects of BWLGN on Rydberg-EIT- AT spectra. The baseline measurement in Fig. 3 shows how a resonant, coherent microwave signal AT-splits and shifts Rydberg-EIT lines in the absence of any noise. The AT splitting in such spectra can be used to per- form an atom-based measurement of the electric field of the coherent microwave signal. Fig. 7-10 demonstrate that BWLGN added to the system can have a profound effect on the Rydberg-EIT-AT spectra. It is seen that the details of the spectral intensity distribution of the BWLGN give rise to a wide range of cases, as to how exactly the Rydberg-EIT-AT spectra change from the noise-free case. Figs. 11 and 12 then show, quantitatively, the BWLGN-induced errors in the atom-based measure- ment of the electric field of the coherent microwave sig- nal. These errors also strongly depend on the spectral intensity distribution of the BWLGN. IV. MODELING THE EFFECTS OF NOISE In order to understand how the various noise sources alter the measured EIT signals, we model these effects as follows. The effect of broadband noise on a Rydberg- atom system consists of two main contributions: (1) on- resonance transitions caused by the noise, and (2) AC Stark shift caused by the noise. The Rydberg atoms in levels |3 and |4 in Fig. 2(b), which are populated by\\nthe coherent sources (lasers, coherent RF source), can transition into other Rydberg levels due to the frequency components of the noise spectrum that are resonant with transitions between Rydberg states. This process is akin to decays driven by blackbody radiation [17, 18]. The usual treatment (in which the radiation field is quan- tized and the transition rate is obtained from Fermis golden rule and summing over the possible field polar- izations and accessible final angular-momentum states) needs to be modified so that it applies to a noise field that has a well-defined polarization and propagation di- rection (given by the microwave horns geometry). Also, the black-body energy density of the field must be re- placed by the setup-specific noise characteristics. We as- sume that, at the location of the atoms, the noise has a spectral intensity (noise intensity per frequency interval, measured in W/(m2 Hz)) of I =\\ndI d\\n() . To conform with our typical measurement scenario (i.e., the noise is applied to the atoms via a RF horn antenna and the atoms are located in the far field of the horn), we quantize the field in one dimension only (the propagation direction of the noise field) and assume a fixed noise field polarization. For the transition rate, Rfi, from an initial state |i into a final state |f, we find Rfi =\\ne2 20~2c\\n|n f |r|i|2I(|fi|) , (4) where 0 is the permittivity of free-space, e is the elemen- tary charge, n is the field-polarization unit vector, and 6 (a) (d) (b) (e) (c) (f) FIG. 7.

(2)], plotted vs. the coherent-signal-to-noise-power ratio (CSNR). fi is the transition frequency (i.e., (Ef Ei)/h, where\\nEf and Ei are the energies of states |f and |i, respec-\\ntively). These rates (Rfi) are in SI units and have the unit per atom and per second. For the given states of interest we calculate the rates, Rfi, for the known noise spectrum I(). Note Rif = Rfi. In the present case, the coherent microwave signal drives the transition between Rydberg states |3 and |4\\nin Fig. 2(b). If the noise spectrum covers the transi- tion |3 and |4, it is included in the Master equation in\\nthe form of two noise-induced bi-directional decay terms with equal rates, R34 = R43, and the corresponding de- cay rates for the coherences that involve levels |3 or |4, or both. For transitions |3 |f and |4 |f different from\\nthe coherently driven |3 |4 transition, the noise\\ndrives transitions at rates per atom of Rf3 = R3f and Rf4 = R4f . Note that the noise-populated levels |f\\nhave no coherences between each other and with any of the levels |1 |4 in Fig. 2(b), because the noise-induced\\ndrive has a random phase. Hence, all levels |f that be-\\ncome populated from level |3, due to the noise, may be\\nlumped into a fictive level |d (see Fig. 2(b)). Similarly,\\nall levels |f that become populated from level |4, are\\nlumped into a fictive level |e. Due to electric-dipole se-\\nlection rules, there is no overlap between the levels in |d\\n(which become populated by the noise from |3) and in\\n|e (which become populated by the noise from |4). The\\nnet rates into the fictive levels are Rd3 =\\n f 6=3,4",
