The density of the fuel (Hydrazine) is 1.01 kg/L at 293 K (Table 18-8 of SME: The New SMAD [1]). Naturally, not all the fuel will be consumed. It is estimated that 97% of the volume is usable [3]. Next, the ullage volume was calculated using the usable volume and the blow-down ratio. The blow-down ratio, defined as the final ullage volume over the initial ullage volume or the initial pressurant pressure over the final pressurant pressure, was assumed to be four, a typical value for modern blow-down propellant tanks. The final total volume was calculated adding the loaded volume and the ullage volume and adding a customary 20% margin. Finally, the tank mass is now sized using the final total volume using a curve fit of commercially available propellant management devices (PMD) propellant tanks. `_ = `57 $ 5 \\\" `_5& = & 5 `57 \\\" \\n F = F # `_5 = `57 \\\" ` = ! !#^ `57 \\\" ] #^ = !#^ ] ^ ]5# = 5# ] ^ ]$_ = 3 7 ] ^ ] 5 = !5 ] ^ Figure 2-9 Loaded Propellant Mass Equation 2-17 After computing the mass of the tank and the propellants, the mass of the pressurant and feed system require calculation. Currently, the initial operating pressure for the tank is unknown; however, an estimation was made from the operating pressure ranges of two candidate thrusters: MRE-1.0 and Monarc 445. The operating range for the MRE-1.0 is 0.055 to 3.9 MPa while the operating range for the Monarc 445 is 0.5 to 3.1 MPa [4] [5]. A 20% margin over the 3.9 MPa was carried so the initial pressure was estimated at 4.7 MPa and the initial temperature at 323 K. The pressurant selected was Helium (He). According to the NIST Chemistry WebBook, the density for He under those conditions is assumed to be 6.87 kg/(~ [6]. The equations for the \\nmass of the pressurant and the feed system can now be solved. To complete the propulsion system model, the mass of the thrusters needed was estimated. For this specific scenario, four thrusters for unloading momentum from the reaction wheels and one main thruster for primary propulsion were selected following the example of the FireSat II. For the attitude control maneuvers, the candidate thruster selected was the flight- proven MRE-1.0. The MRE-1.0 has a mass of 0.5 kg, average thrust of 3.4 N, and maximum thrust of 5.0 N. For the primary propulsion thruster, the potential candidate thruster is the Monarc-445 which has a mass of 1.6 kg and steady state thrust of 445 N. While these thrusters should meet thrust requirements, a final decision can be made after more information on thrust levels is gathered from the completion of the ADCS model. 2.9 First Order Estimate of Satellite Dimensions A first order estimate of the satellites dimensions and mass minus the attitude and control system are needed to size the ADCS. With the first order mass estimates finalized and the size of several subsystems known a priori, the satellites dimensions were calculated through a first order approximation process. Although, the ADCS cannot be sized prior to the calculation, it 2-18 constitutes a very small percentage of the overall size and mass of the satellite. As a result, the satellite was sized with a small portion of the volume reserved. To create an estimate of the satellites dimensions, the author utilized an Excel spreadsheet to document the dimensions of each of the parts needed. With an Excel spreadsheet listing the dimensions of each part, SolidWorks, a solid modeling computer-aided design and computer-aided engineering computer program, can be utilized to create a 3D model to estimate the overall dimensions of the satellite body needed to store all the parts. 2.10 ADCS Model 2.10.1 Introduction The final subsystem to be sized was the Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem (ADCS). First, the determination transmitters were selected based off the pointing requirements. Once the determination transmitters were selected, the MATLAB model was initialized. The MATLAB model required vehicle, orbital, and Earth properties as input to generate the cyclical and secular angular momentum per orbit, a single reaction wheel mass, the fuel required for momentum dumping over the satellite lifetime, and the thrust required for each momentum dumping event. 2.10.2 Determination Transmitters The driving force behind the selection of the determination transmitters was the pointing requirements of the payload. The RF transmitter described by MITRE has a 45-degree half-angle cone; however, the laser communication system does not have this ability afforded to it. Laser communication systems often require pointing accuracy to 1. As a result, a star tracker was 2-19 selected due to its ability to meet this accuracy requirement. Furthermore, a sun sensor was also selected in conjunction with the star tracker for redundancy of data and for its ability to help with determination during maneuvers such as detumbling. 2.10.3 Attitude and Control System (ACS) Initiation File The purpose of the initiation file was to establish satellite properties and to call the functions that will determine the torques on the satellite and subsequently size the reaction wheels and thrusters accordingly. The vehicle properties utilized by the program included physical dimensions, center of gravity, mass, surface material code, and the lifespan of the vehicle. Next, the orbital elements for the proposed satellite were input. The last information input was the properties of Earth. Finally, the ACS Sizing function was called by the MATLAB script, and the torques and the ACS size were estimated. 2.10.4 ACS Sizing Function 2.10.4.1 Introduction The ACS Sizing function requires inputs of the orbital elements, vehicle parameters, and planet parameters to compute the cyclical and secular angular momentum, the reaction wheel mass, the ACS fuel mass required, and the thrust required per momentum dump. Several steps are required to accomplish this task. First, the vehicles 2nd moment of inertia and the time for one orbit were calculated thereby enabling calculation and summation of the solar radiation, aerodynamic, magnetic, and gravity torques. This process was completed for the entire angular range of the orbit (0 to 360 degrees). Using the computed torques, the maximum torques around the orbit were integrated to find the total angular moment which was then used to find the cyclical and secular angular momentums. Lastly, the reaction wheel was sized using the cyclical angular momentum while the ACS propellant mass and thrust required for momentum dumping 2-20 were sized using the secular momentum dumping. The calculated torques were displayed on a polar graph for visualization purposes. 2.10.4.2 Solar Radiation Pressure (SRP) Torque Calculation Sunlight (i.e. photons) has momentum, and therefore exerts pressure when it strikes an object. The more absorptive the material, the more momentum absorbed resulting in a certain pressure force. If the sunlight is reflected, the pressure force felt is twice as much as the pressure force if all the sunlight is absorbed. While it is extremely difficult to estimate the true SRP because of the varying surfaces used on a satellite, a good first-order estimate can be made by assuming uniform reflectance. With uniform reflectance assumed, the following equation is appropriate: = C1 + ( cos 2 Figure 2-11 SRP Torque Equation The solar constant was assumed to be 1,366 W/(). The surface material number was one of the \\ninputs gathered at the beginning of the ACS Model. Using an Excel spread sheet, the MATLAB function gathered the reflectance factor (q) corresponding to the surface material number input by the user. Lastly, the angle of incidence of the sun was assumed to be zero degrees (worst- case). Listed below are the reflectance factors for possible spacecraft surface materials. ! = 3 !5 7 = 3 4# # /78 \\n c = Speed of Light m/s = = 35# 35$ = 7 = $ # = 4# $ 3 m 7 = 4# $ ] 7 < = 35# ;## =# 2-21 2.10.4.3 Atmospheric Drag Torque Calculation Just as photons have momentum and create pressure upon impacting a spacecraft, air particles also have momentum and create pressure when they impact a spacecraft. The density of air and pressure decrease exponentially with increasing altitude. As a result, only spacecraft in Name",
