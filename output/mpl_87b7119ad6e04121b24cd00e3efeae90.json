The locations of the\\nsuspensions are shown in Figure 4-15. The reasons for the suspension, and the action after the\\nsuspension, are shown in Table 4-12. Of the eight suspended IM operations, three later\\nresumed, three never resumed,10 and two were later terminated. Five of the eight (63%), were\\nfrom one controller. The times to resume or terminate the IM operation are shown in Table\\n4-13. Figure 4-15. Location of Controller Suspensions 10 These were cases were the controller entered a suspend command but never re-engaged. Therefore, while the\\ncontroller entered the command for suspension, IM was terminated since it never resumed. The controller,\\nhowever, did not enter the command for termination. 4-19 Table 4-12.

Forty-\\nfour terminations were for pseudo-pilot aircraft and four were for flight deck participant\\naircraft. Table 4-14 shows the terminations by controller tool set. Percentages are based on the\\nnumber of total operations conducted when that tool set was used. A higher number of\\nterminations occurred for the basic+ cue and prediction tool set as compared to both other tool\\nsets, with more (7) relative to the basic tool set. Figure 4-16 and Figure 4-17 show the IM\\ntermination locations by IM clearance type. Table 4-14.

IM Termination Locations for Both Achieve-by IM Clearance Types Figure 4-17. IM Termination Locations for Capture then Maintain IM Clearance Type 4-21 Of the 48 IM terminations, 60.4% (29 of 48) were achieve-by clearances and 39.6% (19 of 48)\\nwere capture operations (Table 4-15). However, 3.3% (29/882) of the terminations were from\\nall the achieve-by clearances and 7.1% (19/269) were from all the capture then maintain\\nclearances. The majority (81.3%; 39 of 48) of terminations were terminated by ATC, followed by the pilot\\nresponding to the controllers termination instructions. Thirteen percent (6 of 48) of cases were\\nwhere only the pseudo-pilot or flight crew terminated. In all six cases, the controller either gave\\na speed or told the flight crew to terminate IM, but neglected to make the keyboard entry.\\nFinally, there were 6.3% (3 of 48) cases where only the controller made a keyboard entry to\\nterminate and potentially issued a voice instruction. In all three cases, the pseudo-pilots\\nappeared to have forgotten to terminate IM (but this did not appear to cause any spacing\\nissues). Table 4-15.

The tool sets had similar times\\nand variances, although the basic+ cue tool set had a lower variance than the others. Table 4-16.

These reasons were stated to the\\nobserver or noted in the post-scenario questionnaire by the controller (if they are in a category\\nother than unknown). The perceived potential to increase efficiency / spacing category\\nincludes situations such as those where the controller thought the ASG was too large or that a\\nlead or trail aircraft could be given a vector. It should be noted that some of the actions after\\nthe termination made the traffic situation more complex and created a worse spacing situation\\nthan if the original schedule and sequence had been utilized. However, in other situations it\\nwas possible to space an aircraft closer than the ASG that was provided by TBFM (e.g., 180\\nseconds)11. Approximately half (10 of 21; 48%) of the perceived potential to increase efficiency\\n spacing events could be attributed to one controller who vectored more frequently than\\nother controllers. Table 4-17. Frequencies for Reasons for Controller IM Termination Reason Total\\nPerceived potential to increase\\nefficiency / spacing 21 Unknown 12\\nSpacing concern 10\\nRF turn concerns 2\\nPrefer not using IM 1\\nForgot IM active 1\\nTrying something 1\\nTotal 48 The spacing concern category includes situations where the controller noted an IM operation\\nwould create a problematic spacing situation (e.g., IM trail aircraft not slowing). The RNP RF\\nturn operation concern were situations where the controller terminated IM based on a\\nconcern for spacing with an aircraft that was part of an RNP RF turn operation. The prefer not\\nusing IM was where a controller preferred to manually manage the speed of the aircraft. The\\nforgot IM active was a situation where the controller issued a speed to an IM trail aircraft\\nafter forgetting the aircraft was flying IM. Observers noted other situations where this\\noccurred, but the pilot reported doing IM and the controller chose not to terminate. Finally, the\\nTrying something category was where the controller stated either he wanted to try a\\nmaneuver to see how IM would react, or to see if an instruction would improve a situation. 11 Large intervals were due to the initial sequence and spacing of arrival aircraft. The TBFM/TSAS schedule does not\\ncontain logic to speed an aircraft up above the profile speed to close up a naturally occurring large gap. 4-23 4.4.4 Flight Crew Reports of Unable\\nIn addition to the controller terminations, there were five participant flight crew reports of\\nunable12. Two were due to receiving an ASG too large message when trying to initiate IM\\n(Table 4-18). Three were made by the flight crews based on the information provided by the IM\\ndisplay information.

Flight crew participants flew the BRUSR1 arrival\\n33% (24 of 73) of the time and EAGUL6 arrival 67% (49 of 73) of the time. The BRUSR1 arrival\\nfrom TRACON entry to touchdown was on average 14.2 minutes (SD=0.8) and the EAGUL6\\narrival 11.5 minutes (SD=1.4) based on the length of flight path for each arrival. The PTP was\\nalways YOKXO. If the lead aircraft was not flying the RNP RF turn (45/73; 62%), the ABP was the\\nmerge point / DERVL. However, when the lead aircraft was flying the RNP RF turn (28/73; 38%),\\nthe ABP was at the FAF / YOKXO and there was no maintain stage. 12 Pseudo-pilots did not have enough information to report unable, so none did so.\\n13 As a reminder, the pilot participants only flew achieve-by then maintain IM type (no capture then maintain). 4-24 4.4.5.1 Frequency of IM Speed Changes\\nTable 4-19 shows the number of speeds received by participant flight crews. The average\\nnumber of IM speeds is shown in Table 4-20. The average number of IM speeds is higher for the\\nachieve-by stage based on the IM aircraft flying for a longer period of time in that stage (on the\\norder of 7 minutes) while the average number of speeds for the maintain stage is less based on\\nthe shorter period of time in that stage (on the order of one minute).
