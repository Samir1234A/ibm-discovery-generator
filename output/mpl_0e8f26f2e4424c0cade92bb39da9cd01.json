Public Release Case Number 18-4487 Fighting Polio in Africa, Thanks to MITRE's Civic Leave Program As a group leader in the International Operations Department, Melissa Utzinger travels the globe helping \\nforeign governments overcome engineering issues. Her typical challenge involves providing rigorous \\nengineering analysis to inform key decision making of partner nations and the U.S. Their goal: to develop \\nan integrated, cohesive system that gets the job done. But recently, she was overseas to tackle a much \\ndifferent challengehow to administer a polio vaccine to a child under five years old. I was a little nervous about it because I dont have a medical background, but fortunately it was drops \\nand not an injection, she says. And I brought boxes of raisins and gave one to every kid after they got \\ntwo drops under their tongue. Pretty soon, the adults were encouraging more kids to do it, so they could \\nget raisins too. Utzinger joined a humanitarian mission sponsored by Rotary International in Benin, a tiny sliver of a \\ncountry on the border of Nigeria in West Africa. Rotary is a founding partner of the Global Polio \\nEradication Initiative, which has immunized more than 2.5 billion children against the disease in 122 \\ncountries. And despite Utzinger's busy work schedule, MITRE not only supported her desire to help others, but also \\nprovided paid time off through our civic leave program. Working for the Health of Childrenand Trees Using her 40 hours of paid volunteer service time, Utzinger flew into the capital city of Cotonou on \\nOctober 2 and spent part of the next week vaccinating the people most vulnerable to this deadly \\ninfectious disease. By the end of her stay, the Rotary volunteers had provided inoculations to more than \\n200 children. The volunteers met in the mornings at a health center where local mothers and children were already \\nlined up to receive the vaccinations. People got so dressed up to come, she says. You could tell it was \\nan important event for them. In the afternoons, Utzinger and her teammates went door-to-door in the neighboring slums. Each person \\nhad a distinct job: locate eligible children, maintain a wearable freezer compartment to keep the \\nvaccines cold, administer the vaccines, and place a mark on each childs left pinky to identify those who \\nreceived inoculations. Team members made their way through the streets, leaving chalk marks on each house to indicate how \\nmany children lived in each one and how many had been inoculated. If they missed any children the first \\ntime around, the team stopped in again on the way home to try and find them. As part of the mission, Rotary International gave each participant a day away from the inoculation work \\nto pursue other volunteer work. Utzinger opted to spend her day planting trees outside the city. She \\nplanted a variety of fast-growing saplings, some for firewood and some with medicinal purposes, such as \\npain relief. Copyright \\nApproved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-4487 Back in her office in Bedford, Massachusetts, Utzinger has been working on a project to help a partner \\nnation integrate their missile defense capabilities into its overall defense architecture while enhancing \\ncoalition, U.S., and regional security capabilities. But the lessons from Benin are never far from her mind. The experience really gave me a better perspective on life here, she says. You realize how fortunate \\nwe are here to have something as basic as clean running waterand you realize how important it is to \\nreach out and help other people. What Is MITRE's Civic Leave Program? The civic leave program offers MITRE employees up to 40 hours of paid time each year for volunteering \\non civic and community projects. It's been around for decades and is extremely popular, says Sue \\nStapleton, who runs the program. In 2018, about 1,300 employees applied for it. The projects include international work, such as providing public health education on HIV in India and \\nconstructing orphanages in the Dominican Republic. Closer to home, the program covers work in \\nfoodbanks, STEM mentoring and outreach, hurricane relief, and work with veterans and senior citizens. \\nRequests must be approved by the appropriate manager. The civic leave program really underscores how important working in the public good is here at MITRE, \\nStapleton says. As a company, our commitment doesnt end with the work day. We really want to \\nsupport our employees in giving back to their communities in their personal lives as well. --by Twig Mowatt PHOTO: _top\\n _Hlk531610489\\n _GoBack \",",

After the baseline environment was captured, the relevant principles described in this paper were conceptually applied to demonstrate the potential cost savings that can be achieved. All of the cost saving measures that are applied in this section preserve the full operational capabilities of the account and would not negatively affect performance. 6.1 Current Cost Estimate A total of 61 individual AWS services are used in the operation of the example DevSecOps account. A complete table of all services, their descriptions, and associated costs can be found in Table 3. Costs were calculated for each service using the AWS Simple Monthly Calculator, and all costs were calculated for the GovCloud US-EAST region. By summing the cost for each individual service, an estimated monthly cost of $7,059.25 was calculated for a DevSecOps account. \\nTable 3 AWS Services in a DevSecOps Account Service ID Description Instance Type Storage \\nInstance Cost \\nStorage Cost EC2 1 SCCA SRX c4.2xlarge 180GB 298.66 23.76 EC2 2 Bastion Host c5.large 180GB 149.33 23.76 EC2 3 Bastion Host (Windows) c5.large 150GB 142.01 19.80 EC2 4 Nginx Reverse Proxy N/A N/A N/A N/A EC2 5 GitLab A c5.xlarge 180GB 149.33 23.76 EC2 6 GitLab B c5.xlarge 180GB 149.33 23.76 EC2 7 Artifactory A c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 8 Artifactory B c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 9 XRAY A c5.2xlarge 180GB 298.66 23.76 EC2 10 XRAY B c5.2xlarge 180GB 298.66 23.76 EC2 11 AD Admin c5.large 150GB 74.67 19.80 EC2 12 AD CS c5.large 150GB 74.67 19.80 EC2 13 BIND A c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 14 BIND B c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 15 WSUS c5.large 150GB + 500GB 74.67 85.80 EC2 16 Jira A c5.xlarge 180GB 149.33 23.76 EC2 17 Jira B c5.xlarge 180GB 149.33 23.76 EC2 18 SonarQube c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 19 CheckMarx c5.large 150GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 20 Confluence A c5.xlarge 180GB 149.33 23.76 EC2 21 Confluence B c5.xlarge 180GB 149.33 23.76 EC2 22 Chef c5.xlarge 180GB 149.33 23.76 EC2 23 Chef Automate c5.2xlarge 180GB 298.66 23.76 EC2 24 RunnerA01 c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 25 RunnerA02 c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 26 RunnerA03 c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 27 RunnerA04 c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 28 RunnerA05 c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 25 EC2 29 RunnerA06 c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 30 RunnerA07 c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 31 RunnerA08 c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 32 RunnerA09 c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 33 RunnerA10 c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 34 RunnerB01 c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 35 RunnerB02 c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 36 RunnerB03 c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 37 RunnerB04 c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 38 RunnerB05 c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 39 RunnerB06 c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 40 RunnerB07 c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 41 RunnerB08 c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 42 RunnerB09 c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 EC2 43 RunnerB10 c5.large 180GB 74.67 23.76 ENI 1 Public Interface N/A N/A N/A N/A ENI 2 Management Interface N/A N/A N/A N/A ENI 3 Private Interface N/A N/A N/A N/A EFS 1 GitLab App A N/A N/A N/A N/A EFS 2 GitLab App B N/A N/A N/A N/A RDS 1 GitLab db.m4.large 200GB 175.07 27.60 RDS 2 Artifactory db.m4.xlarge 200GB 175. 07 27.60 RDS 3 XRAY db.m4.large 200GB 175. 07 27.60 RDS 4 SonarQube db.m4.large 200GB 175. 07 27.60 RDS 5 Jira db.m4.large 200GB 175. 07 27.60 RDS 6 Confluence db.m4.large 200GB 175. 07 27.60 ELB 1 GitLab N/A N/A N/A N/A ELB 2 Artifactory N/A N/A N/A N/A ELB 3 Jira N/A N/A N/A N/A ELB 4 SonarQube N/A N/A N/A N/A ELB 5 Confluence N/A N/A N/A N/A ElastiCache 1 GitLab N/A N/A N/A N/A Directory Service 1 AWS Directory Service N/A 180GB 74.67 23.76 Total: 5821.81 1237.44 \\n Total: 7059.25 The most common and costliest services in the example DevSecOps account are the use of EC2 and RDS instances. Collectively, the EC2 and RDS instances account for $6,862.39 of the total $7,059.25, or 97% of the accounts monthly cost. Therefore the majority of the conscious cost improvements are related to EC2 and RDS services, but the other cost saving techniques outlined in this paper are still viable for environments using a broader set of managed services across multiple AWS accounts. 6.2 Cost Conscious Improvements 6.2.1 Reserved Instances The single most effective recommendation for cost optimization in the prototypical DevSecOps account, which can also be applied to any other accounts in the government program, is the use of Reserved Instances in place of On-Demand Instances. A more detailed description of Reserved Instances can be found in Section 3.1. 26 Table 4 lists all EC2 and RDS instance types that are used in the modeled DevSecOps accounts, along with their monthly costs for On-Demand and Reserved types, respectively. The table also lists the difference in cost and the percent discount of using a Reserved Instance rather than the On-Demand Instances, which are currently utilized for all of the example programs EC2 and RDS instances. Figure 8 shows a visual comparison of the pricing difference. \\nTable 4 Cost Comparison of DevSecOps Instance Types Instance Type On Demand \\n3 Year Reserved (No Upfront) Cost Reduction Percent of Costs Saved c5.large $74.67 $29.93 $44.74 60.0% c5.xlarge $149.33 $59.13 $90.20 60.4% c5.2xlarge $298.66 $118.99 $179.67 60.2% db.m5.large $152.82 $134.23 $18.59 12.2% db.m5.xlarge $302.88 $165.62 $137.26 45.3% \\nFigure 8 On-Demand Compared to Reserved Pricing Table 5 shows the application of switching all EC2 and RDS instances from On-Demand to Reserved Instance types. The price difference is calculated for each type of instance existing in the account then multiplied by the quantity deployed. Costs for 3-year Reserved Instances with no upfront payment were used to calculate the cost savings. By using 3-year, no upfront payment instances, there is no additional immediate capital required to initiate this strategy. \\nTable 5 Application of Reserved Instances to DevSecOps Account 74.67 149.33 298.66 152.82 302.8829.93 59.13 118.99 134.23 350 c5.large c5.xlarge c5.2xlarge db.m5.large db.m5.xlargeMontly CostOn Demand Reserved 27 Instance Type \\nQuantity Deployed Reserved Savings per Instance \\nTotal Savings c5.large 31 $44.74 $1386.94 c5.xlarge 8 $90.20 $721.6 c5.2xlarge 4 $179.67 $718.68 db.m5.large 5 $18.59 $92.95 db.m5.xlarge 1 $137.26 $137.26 Total 49 $3057.43 By utilizing Reserved Instances in a DevSecOps account, the total monthly bill was reduced from $7,059.25 to $4,001.82, which represents $3057.43 in cost savings. Reserved Instances were able to achieve a 43% savings with no upfront cost or performance reduction. 6.2.2 Auto-Scaling Groups Another powerful technique for saving operational costs in a cloud environment is the implementation of Auto-Scaling Groups (ASG), which is an AWS managed service that utilizes automated scaling logic to launch or terminate instances according to computing requirements. ASGs enable AWS users to instantiate business rules which, for example, launch additional EC2 instances when the current set of EC2 instances exceeds 80% capacity for more than a specified amount of time. A detailed description of ASGs can be found in Section 3.3 Auto Scaling and Automating Elasticity. The cost savings associated with ASGs are realized when they are implemented on applications that have variable usage patterns. For example, Gitlab Runners (or equivalent tools) require significant computing capacity when running jobs, but sit idle for long durations between jobs. With an ASG in place, the Gitlab Runners can utilize just one EC2 instance (instead of twenty) when idle between jobs, then scale up to multiple, appropriately-sized EC2 instances when Gitlab Runner jobs arrive. In practice, the GitLab runners are often used for an hour or less per day, but they are required to be left running due to security scans. In this cost calculation exercise, we will assume the runners are only used for 1 hour a day (a liberal estimate), and the remaining 19 instances are set behind an auto-scaling group. In practice, the remaining instances could scale to be more or less than 19 instances, and their instance type could vary to accommodate jobs, but we will hold this assumption to show equivalent compute capacity of the current state at a reduced cost. To reconfigure the runners behind an auto-scaling group, one runner is running 24x7 so there is never any downtime when starting a job. When a job is submitted, the single runner will have a demand that exceeds capacity, and the auto-scaling group will be initiated. The remaining 19 instances will be deployed in a matter of minutes, and the workload can be distributed between them. This generates a total of \\n\\n = 1 \\n 24 +19 \\n 1 = 43 \\n , when compared to the current state of all 20 \\ninstances running 24 hours a day, or \\n\\n = 20 \\n 24 =480 \\n . The use of auto-scaling groups reduces the billable time for the runners by \\n91 percent, reducing the monthly bill for the runners from $1,493.28 to $133.78. 28 \\nFigure 9 Cost Reduction using Auto-scaling 6.2.3 Stopped Instances If Reserved Instances are not adopted, an alternative strategy would be stopping and starting instances based",
