  "text": "runway from the planned runway at the in-range call is very common at the larger airports, though the downlink usually reflects an accurate runway configuration. \\nFigure 3-16. Most Frequent Differences between Downlink Runway and Arrival Runway 5-21 These results confirm that the in-range trigger is not sufficient for obtaining accurate runway and approach information for all flights, which impacts the accuracy of approach utilization data presented in Section 3.2. Future efforts should focus on alternative trigger mechanisms, including triggers a specified distance/time from arrival, or automated triggers for any flight plan route change. Airline Feedback on Collection \\nDelta Air Lines made several observations that are consistent with the original research motivation for tracking approach utilization via downlink: There is a unique value to gathering and analyzing data on which procedures are being flown following PBN implementations. The return on PBN investments needs to be measured and the results will inform future implementation throughout the NAS. The downlink framework provides definitive data that will help the FAA and industry evaluate whether PBN capabilities are bearing fruit or being utilized appropriately across the NAS. With better information on which approaches are being utilized, the FAA can better allocate resources to increase safety and operational use of procedures, and develop new procedures and technologies that will be beneficial. ATC may also benefit from an increased understanding of approach utilization trends and coordination with operators and the FAA on a strategy going forward. Local operators can leverage the same data to measure their respective fleets participation rates in locations where specific PBN procedures are available (e.g., did we fly the RNAV RNP AR procedures in locations where our company policy advises us to, for safety and performance related reasons). Operators can also use this data to determine if and where they may need to address training or procedural deficiencies to increase the likelihood crews will fly these procedures. Delta Air Lines has been engaging ATC and internally with their Training and Standards group to increase usage of PBN procedures at KATL. The downlink data may be useful for evaluating progress in PBN procedure usage as a result of this engagement. Recommended Next Steps \\nThis report used a sample of downlink data, periodically emailed to MITRE CAASD from Delta Air Lines, to demonstrate the ability to extract and analyze planned instrument approaches and illustrate other potential uses of the data. However, for continued research this methodology presents two challenges. First, an expansion to additional aircraft types and operators will increase data volume and necessitate a transition from e-mail delivery to an automated data capture and processing system. Further, during flight operations, pilots commonly make flight plan changes to respond to emerging airspace and air traffic control conditions (e.g. runway changes). The ability to adjust collection content and timing offers a potential increase in the quality, types of data, and analyses that can be performed. Ideally, a running log of flight plan changes would be available for every flight, but available downlink content and collection timing is airline-specific. Data sharing agreements must balance analysis needs and the feasibility of airline participation in collecting and sharing the downlink data. Recommended improvements to downlink collection activities for future efforts include: 5-22 Adjust trigger mechanism to improve context of data collected need to be addressed Airline operations agreements to request data at more times of interest (e.g., a \\ndownlink when ~5 miles from the destination airport would increase the likelihood the approach procedure in downlink is correct, or triggering the downlink when the landing gear or flaps are lowered) Airline activation of internal FMS triggers (e.g., the plan modification trigger \\nwould ensure up-to-date FMS plans are collected) Explore downlink content or acceptable modifications to help identify control modes \\nover the various phases of flight (e.g., the aircrafts ability to downlink LNAV, VNAV, or ILS coupled autopilot guidance would separate FMS and hand-flown approach segments). The archive of downlinked messages can leverage various data management tools to \\naddress airline agreements (e.g., access, redaction and retention policies) Increase awareness of downlink flight data, processing schemes, and analysis steps for \\nother FAA and industry stakeholders. Documentation of downlink capabilities is available, but often highlights downlink functionality for research concepts, rather than for facilitating operational data analysis. Explore the research potential for other ACARS downlink capabilities by surveying and \\ndocumenting common airline downlinks that may be applicable for future studies. Knowing what data is available, and common customizations increases awareness of existing data sources and how and where that information could be obtained. If appropriate, integrate downlink data with TTFS and PBN Analytics for data intake and \\nfollow-on processing. The analyses in this report used downlink data fused to trajectory data sources. Expansion of data volume with additional airlines would likely make it practical and cost effective to automate these data fusion efforts and leverage established data management methods. 6-23 References [1] J.

A-1 Appendix A ACARS Datalink Samples \\nThis section describes early message format examination with American Airlines route (containing procedure data) downlinks as well as an examination of the Delta Air Lines downlinks collected for this work. The Delta Air Lines downlinks are compared to results generated by MITRE CAASDs GE 737 FMS Test Bench, which was also used to examine other potential ACARS message requests for procedure identification and other NAS research activities.

This example shows the effect of tailoring downlink requests based on airline customizations of ACARS behaviors. Delta Air Lines use of the RP request for the samples collected in this study would produce no response from the 737 FMS. Because there is evidence Delta Air Lines tailors their downlink requests by aircraft type it is likely they use the RI request for that aircraft model. A.1.1 Delta Air Lines Airline Data Samples With the Delta Air Lines dataset the in-range AOC RP request was used and a small a sample of a transferred file is shown in Figure A-1. Agreements were to sample Delta Air Lines Boeing 757 and 767 Delta Air Lines operations, however, examination of these records showed Delta Air Lines ACARS data included other fleet aircraft (B717, A350). MITRE CAASDs data intake and processing can cross reference identify tail numbers to identify and categorize by aircraft type if necessary. \\nFigure A-1.
