There are significant airline costs to create and deploy customizations because they effectively change the aircrafts avionics and could potentially disrupt ground side data processing. Typically these loads simply activate existing FMS features with little effort. For a higher level of customization, operators can build their own message content that will respond to special request codes not claimed by current ARINC 702A definitions. Conversations with General Electrics Boeing 737 FMS experts and research into the Thales/Smiths Airbus FMS reveals internal FMS capabilities (e.g., airborne triggering mechanisms) that can be enabled by airline customers. These ready-to-use customizations may hold immediate value for continued research into ACARS downlink data processing. Built-in airborne triggers (e.g., time to destination) could easily ensure accurate flight plan reports are collected. For the GE system, the customizable downlink capabilities include: automated triggers (report an aircraft event, such as those described below), transactional (downlink responses to AOC or ATC uplinks), and FMS-CDU activity (status, errors, or faults). Along with the ability to enable or disable these report downlinks, the GE system also allows operators to customize what information messages will be downlinked. As Airbus and Boeing 2-6 define common features on their aircraft avionics, those same GE/Thales features are likely to be present in Honeywell or other suppler avionics offering similar report capability. Particularly useful are the automated event triggers for the GE 737 FMS that include: Five time-to-destination triggers When flight plan modification is executed (EXEC key-in) Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) change Destination airport change Destination runway change In-Air (speed and strut switch) Cruise level entry FMS wind setting/experienced Modifying these triggers was discussed with Delta Air Lines, but determined to be out of scope for the initial data collection effort given potential complexity of these modifications. Revisiting these options with Delta Air Lines, or use of ACARS customization during discussions with other airlines, is recommended for future efforts. An airline fleet with more airframe uniformity (e.g., Alaska Airlines or Southwest Airlines, who predominantly use Boeing 737 aircraft) may allow the airline to be less at risk of disruption when modifying datalink behavior. Conversations with Alaskas ACARS focal indicated they perform frequent ADDB updates. 2.4 Data Collection Considerations The following data collection considerations are intended to better match data needs to an airlines specific ACARS configuration and operating procedures. An ideal case is an airlines willingness to freely change their ACARS data operations to match the project needs. As that is unlikely without significant resource investment, coordination meetings need to identify project data needs, and balance with the airlines ability and willingness to meet those needs. The considerations are: Communicate and verify project use cases of ACARS data with airline Identify airline data sensitivity and agreements, data processing impacts, data protection \\nrequirements Determine current ACARS usage, operating procedures of airline, current and potential \\nACARS trigger mechanisms, and aircraft type variations Verify available ACARS data content matches project needs If necessary, determine airline willingness to modify or add ACARS transmissions or \\noperating procedures Define data transfer and archiving methodology, such as e-mail/FTP transfers between \\nparties or direct ACARS access 2.4.1 Delta Air Lines Collection Details This study required an approach procedure identifier already present in Delta Air Lines ACARS collection scheme. Delta Air Lines datalink process was not significantly modified MITRE CAASD received samples from their standard ongoing AOC downlink monitoring activities. MITRE CAASD and Delta Air Lines Airlines agreed to use Delta Air Lines existing in-range 3-7 AOC report trigger for the initial collection activity. The Delta Air Lines in-range downlink is crew initiated as a step in their arrival briefing, so the timing of this downlink can vary. Once the in-range downlink is received by the AOC, a request for the current flight plan is automatically uplinked; the downlink of the approach procedure message is also automated. Requirements for enhanced downlink trigger mechanisms that isolate the approach phase of flight or capture all flight plan changes were not specifically addressed with this work. As mentioned in Section 2.3.2, automated FMS trigger points could easily reduce planned vs. flown errors on approach procedure identification by using a plan modification or time to destination downlink triggers. Making that a hard requirement would have increased costs to Delta Air Lines and increased the time needed to complete this initial data analysis effort. The value of altering an airlines ACARS data requests and specific trigger points must be acceptable to airline participants. 2.5 Other Uses of Downlink Data This document has a narrow focus of leveraging the REQFPN,RP (request, flight plan, active route) message to derive approach procedure utilization data. Customizing and expanding on the downlink messages and the ability to set the downlink triggers could allow for the use of ACARS in many other areas of research including: Safety studies (vertical performance assessment, procedure blunders, discrepancy in \\napproach clearance versus flown procedure) Operational concepts validation (e.g., Time of Arrival Control, Interval Management) Trajectory Modeling Applications (e.g., comparing ground automation trajectories to \\nFMS trajectories) Validation of algorithms (e.g. SID/STAR usage algorithms, ATC-pilot voice \\ncommunications) The above uses of the data will require greater operator involvement and buy-in. MITRE CAASD continues to develop relationships with various operator and will look to expand data collection as needed to support FAA research activities. Downlink Data Analysis \\nMITRE CAASD conducted an initial analysis with the Delta Air Lines downlink data to verify applicability to the approach utilization use case. The following sections show these analysis results, highlighting the scope, features, and accuracy of downlink data received, planned instrument approach trends, and the utility of downlink data for several use cases. Further, the data analysis results highlight some limitations of the in-range call as the primary trigger mechanism. Delta Air Lines provided MITRE CAASD downlink data for most days in May-July 2018 for its B757 and B767 fleets. MITRE CAASD ingested these downlink messages, and fused the messages to published procedure data within Digital Terminal Procedures Publication (d-TPP) and flight trajectory data from System-Wide Information Management Flight data Publication Service (SFDPS), and produced data visualizations and analysis results. 3-8 3.1 Completeness of Downlink Data Delta Air Lines agreed to test the trigger mechanism and initial data sharing for its B757 and B767 fleet. Figure 3-1 confirms that the vast majority of downlink messages received from Delta Air Lines are within the B757 and B767 fleet. Outliers are described more in Section 3.3. \\nFigure 3-1. Downlink Messages by Aircraft Type \\nFigure 3-2. Daily Downlink Data Availability (May-June 2018) 3-9 Figure 3-2 shows daily downlink data coverage for the Delta Air Lines B757 and B767 fleet arriving in the CONUS; some days in May, late June and early July 2018 were not included in the downlink data sent from Delta Air Lines to MITRE CAASD. Figure 3-3 compares the number of flights for which a downlink message was received to the number of arrivals at each airport. Excluding days for which no downlink data was transferred from Delta Air Lines to MITRE CAASD, this ratio ranges from 75 to 85% of Delta Air Lines B757 and 767 flights across top Continental US (CONUS) airports; note, downlink data is not available for arrivals to non-CONUS airports with the current data sharing architecture. \\nFigure 3-3. Flights with Downlink Messages vs. Arrival Counts While the data does not represent all Delta Air Lines operations, there is sufficient data to conduct proof-of-concept data analyses. However, if this downlink data were to be used for broader studies that required full coverage, MITRE CAASD would need to work with the airlines to ensure downlinks are delivered more consistently. 3.2 Approach Procedure Analyses The initial use case for the downlink data is evaluation of approach utilization across the NAS to help the FAA achieve PBN transition goals and related benefits. Figure 3-4 below shows the frequency of respective approach types loaded into the FMS at downlink time for the Delta Air Lines B757 and B767 fleet. The approach type in the FMS route plan is usually Instrument Landing System (ILS), with RNAV (GPS) and RNAV (RNP) approaches also being planned. 3-10 \\nFigure 3-4. Planned Approach Type in FMS at Downlink Time Figure 3-5 shows this approach breakdown at an airport level. This type of breakdown has not been possible to create via the trajectory-based analysis in the PBN Analysis System. Most airports utilize ILS as the primary approach, but those that also rely on RNAV procedures include John F Kennedy International Airport (KJFK), Orlando International Airport (KMCO), San Francisco International Airport (KSFO), Southwest Florida International Airport (KRSW), Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (KFLL), San Diego International Airport (KSAN), and Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport (KMSY). It is important to note that these results reflect the approach loaded in the FMS at downlink time, which may not be the ultimately executed approach type. Section 3.4 expands on the importance of downlink timing on accuracy of the approach, along with data that highlights limitations with the downlink trigger mechanism used in this study. 3-11 \\nFigure 3-5.
