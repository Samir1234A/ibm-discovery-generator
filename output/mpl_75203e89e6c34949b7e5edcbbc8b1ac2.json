  "sdl_extracted_summary": "before progressing to more challenging \\nimplementations. For example, initial implementations that limit allowable wake category \\npairings and operate to higher approach weather minima could be considered in advance of a \\nPA-specific separation standard being finalized (Bateman, et al., 2017). IM PA separation and \\nimplementation may not be fully understood until after the completion of a full safety process, \\nseparation standard design, and determination of facility-specific adaption parameters. IM PA Setup3.2.4\\nThe IM PA procedure is contained within the terminal area and can only be executed once both \\naircraft are established on their final approach courses. IM PA would function equally well \\nwithin metered and non-metered flows. The two domains differ mainly in the way aircraft are \\ndelivered to the approach and their initial spacing controlled to ensure success. These \\ndifferences are shown in Table 2-1. Table 2-1.

Or, when available, IM PA can be set up by another IM operation \\nthat is initiated en route. This other IM operation delivers the IM PA pair to their final approach \\nsegments in position to transition to an IM PA procedure. A scenario that illustrates both cases \\nis summarized in Penhallegon & Stassen (2018). ix\\n 5 Several of the figures in this section are adapted from Mendolia, et al. (2016). When metering is not available, controllers must manually set up a tactical IM PA operation, \\npossibly with the support of unique IM PA tools. this involves the identification of aircraft pairs, \\nAssigned Spacing Goals, and establishing the aircraft on their final approaches with the \\nappropriate initial spacing as described in Stassen, et al. (2013) and FAA (2017b). ATC HITL \\nresearch involving controllers from Northern California TRACON (NCT) suggests this is feasible \\n(Domino, Tuomey, Stassen, & Mundra, 2014), though somewhat challenging if a 15 NM or \\nlonger final is an absolute minimum requirement (Mendolia, et al., 2016). General setup conditions and procedures for either the metering or non-metering (tactical) case \\nare not further described in this paper as they are not directly relevant to the findings. \\nHowever, potential concepts for setting up IM PA for SFO arrival operations are described in \\nSection 2.3.3. Planned Final Approach Speed3.2.5\\nIn any arrival and approach operation, it is important to understand the speed profile of \\nsuccessive arrivals late in the approach to maximize buffer reduction. As described in Stassen, \\nPriess, & Weitz (2016), factors such as final approach speed have a bearing on the evolution of \\nthe spacing interval late in the approach. Because of this, the PA concept has traditionally \\nassumed the need for Planned Final Approach Speed (PFAS) as input to the spacing goal \\ncalculation Stassen, et al. (2013). One implication is that if the relative difference in PFAS \\nbetween the IM Trail Aircraft and IM Lead Aircraft changes beyond a certain threshold, the \\nAssigned Spacing Goal may need to be recalculated and sent to the IM Trail Aircraft. It is not \\nknown if it will be necessary to consider changes in PFAS in real time once the aircraft have \\nbeen cleared for their approaches. It may ultimately be decided to allow the aircraft to be \\nbroken out only if it appears that either the CSL and WSL will be exceeded. The requirements for providing PFAS and managing revisions are still being determined. Due to \\nthe lack of definition around the alternatives and trade space, the research scope for this study \\ndid not include an examination of the human factors issues associated with relative PFAS \\nchanges and Assigned Spacing Goal updates. Application of IM PA to NCT and SFO Operations3.3\\nImplementation of the IM PA procedure is highly dependent on the facility and operational \\nenvironment. As this HITL simulation examined an IM PA operation at NCT/SFO, this section \\nprovides an overview of the relevant airspace, then summarizes how IM PA operations could \\npossibly be incorporated into NCT and SFO arrival operations in both metering and non-\\nmetering environments. NCT/SFO Airspace Overview3.3.1\\nAs shown in Figure 2-55, NCT manages three main flows into SFO airspace, worked by a variety \\nof positions. The DYAMD flow is worked by the Cedar High Feeder, Niles Low Feeder and Foster \\nFinal. The SERFR flow is worked by the Laguna High Feeder, Boulder Low Feeder and Woodside \\nFinal, and the BDEGA flow is worked by the Boulder Low Feeder and Woodside Low Final \\n(landing Runway 28L) or Foster Final (landing Runway 28R). The approximate balance of traffic x\\n on these three routes is 50 percent on DYAMD, 25 percent on SERFR, and 25 percent on BDEGA. A \\nsmall number of satellite airport operations (Oakland, San Carlos, San Jose) and tailored oceanic \\narrivals (PIRAT) occur in the airspace. In addition, vectoring airspace floors are established to \\naccommodate Moffet Federal Airfield operations. Figure 2-5. SFO Traffic Flows and ATC Positions The SFO arrival and departure sectors are depicted in Figure 2-6. Four arrival positions normally \\nmanage the inbound flows to SFO. The low altitude arrival positions are NILES and BOULDER \\nand the high-altitude positions are CEDAR and LAGUNA. All breakouts are handed off to the \\ndeparture sector SUTRO. xi\\n Figure 2-6. NCT/SFO Arrival and Departure Sectors The two Final Approach sectors, FOSTER and WOODSIDE, are shown in Figure 2-7. Figure 2-7. NCT/SFO Final Approach Sectors IM PA Monitoring at NCT/SFO3.3.2\\nRequirements for separation monitoring and controller roles and responsibilities for IM PA at \\nNCT and SFO must be generally compatible with the facilitys arrival operation and equipment \\ncapabilities. Due to its dual intersecting runway configuration shown in Figure 2-8, SFO currently \\nemploys a single Local controller (plus a radar assist) to manage arrivals and departures on the \\n28 Left (L)/28R runways and 1L/1R runways. During SOIA operations, FAA Order 7110.65X \\nrequires separate monitor controllers, each with transmit / receive and override capability for \\ntheir assigned runway on the local control frequency (FAA, 2017a). In the case of SFO and NCT, a \\nwaiver was granted to allow the monitoring of SOIA arrivals at NCT on Woodsides and Fosters \\nfrequencies which eliminates the possibility of the monitors blocking critical transmissions on \\nSFO Local frequency. This is possible at SFO because SOIA procedures allow for separate \\nleft/right (L/R) Final Approach controllers to work the finals until the aircraft are 3.3 mile from \\nthe runway. Only then are they handed off to the Local controller. The trailing aircraft then \\nnavigates visually for the last portion of the approach. At this point, the aircraft no longer \\nrequire monitoring and are transferred to the single Local controller. xii\\n Figure 2-8. SFO Airport Map IM PA is intended for operations in IMC and does not require the use of visual separation during \\nthe final portion of the approach. Implementing separate L/R Monitor controllers, as would be \\nrequired by current 7110.65X rules, may not be practical or feasible at SFO since that would also \\nrequire separate Local controllers and frequencies, one for each arrival runway. This could \\nintroduce significant coordination challenges managing the airports four runway intersections \\nand runway crossings for arrival aircraft. However, past research results suggest that similar to \\nSOIA, dedicated Monitor controllers would be the preferred implementation at NCT/SFO to \\nprovide IM PA separation (Mendolia, et al., 2016). Due to the challenges this would introduce at \\nfacilities such as SFO, the feasibility and acceptability for a single monitor controller to provide \\nIM PA separation needed to be examined. Lateral Deviations3.3.2.1\\nThe SFO monitor display consists of a PRM display with 4:1 lateral expansion and 1 second \\nupdate, an NTZ region that aircraft are not allowed to penetrate, and NTZ alerting that indicates \\nif one does penetrate or is predicated to penetrate the NTZ located between the two runways. \\nThe NTZ for SOIA requires straight-in approaches until the visual segment (FAA, 2017a). The \\nSOIA monitoring task requires that controllers take action if an aircraft enters the NTZ region. At \\nSFO the NTZ consists of a rectangle that is 2000 ft wide, beginning at the point where vertical xiii\\n 6 The offset is also required to overcome navigation overlap and to enable the design of the IM PA safety limits. separation would be lost, and ending approximately 3.3 NM from the runways. At that point the \\ndistance between the respective approach courses is the required 3000 ft, which provides a 500 \\nft buffer to the end of the NTZ. After this point, monitoring ends as the aircraft transition to \\nvisual separation approximately 3.3 NM from the runway for the Lead and 3.4 NM from the \\nrunway for the Trail. An IM PA RNAV",

  "text": "well as concept evaluations prior to this\\nsimulation. Three main features were added for IM: an IM clearance window, aircraft role in and status of\\nIM in the aircraft data block, and a slot marker color change. This section will provide\\nintroductory / background information and then review the specific features. IM states were shown in previous simulations, though not all the states were the same (e.g.,\\nAligne et al., 2003; Benson et al., 2011; Baxley et al., 2016). For this simulation, the following\\nstates were defined from a ground system perspective and were relevant to the IM interface: Pre-initiation: Automation is evaluating pairs of aircraft for IM. Eligible pairs are\\npresented to the controller as an IM operation proposal. Initiation: Automation has proposed the IM clearance to the controller but the IM\\noperation has not been started. Conduct: IM proposal has been accepted by the controller and is active if the controller\\nissued the clearance and the flight crew engaged IM. Suspension: IM operation is temporarily inactive. Termination: IM operation is inactive.\\nEach of the states can have sub-states related to the validity and feasibility of the operation (as\\nshown in Figure 3-23). Transitions between states were either through controller or automation\\naction. See Appendix A for further information on the validity and feasibility checks. Controller\\ninputs to change states are shown in Table 3-1. 3-23 Figure 3-23.

Validity checks were made to determine whether the criteria for initiating IM\\nwere met. If any of the validity check failed, the clearance was not proposed to the controller.\\nFeasibility checks were also conducted prior to proposing and during any eligible IM clearance\\nproposal. Feasibility checks determined whether the IM operation could achieve the ASG with\\nspeed alone (the equivalent of the TSAS early / late indicator). If any of the feasibility checks\\nfailed, that information was presented to the controller in the status field as Eligible No\\nSpeed. In order to overcome the feasibility issue, the controller needed to provide a vector or\\nspeed greater or less than that IM would provide (i.e., greater or less than 15% of the profile\\nspeed). Feasibility checks were also conducted during the suspended and terminated states\\n(see Appendix A). 3.1.3.3.1 IM Clearance Window\\nBased on past work, it was determined that an IM clearance window should be used to provide\\ninformation that the controller would communicate as part of the IM clearance. The STARS\\ndisplay did not have a metering list to integrate the IM information into, so one had to be\\ndeveloped. It was determined that the clearance window should also show the status of the clearance\\ninformation (e.g., a proposed IM clearance versus an active IM operation). The information\\nprovided in the IM clearance window is expected to support that shown in the data block. Such\\ninformation may be necessary if not all states are shown in the data block (e.g., suspension or\\ninvalid) or may be necessary to specify that status of each pair in the list so data blocks do not\\nneed to be cross referenced. Four of the five defined states were shown to the controller. Pre-initiation and initiation were\\ncombined and labeled as Eligible. Conduct was labeled as Active. Suspension and\\ntermination were labeled as Suspended and Terminated respectively. If the clearance was determined to be valid and feasible, the clearance information and an\\nEligible status was provided in the IM clearance window to the controller with the trail\\naircraft. The information in the IM clearance window was only shown to the controller with the\\ntrail aircraft, whether or not that controller also had the lead aircraft. The clearance could be\\naccepted or rejected by the controller. If the clearance was rejected, the Status field changed to\\nRejected. The text remained for 30 seconds prior to the full IM clearance proposal being 3-25 removed. This delay allowed for awareness of the rejected operation and to allow for re-\\nactivation if the rejection was in error. If an operation had been rejected, it was not proposed\\nagain to the same controller / sector. However, it was proposed to the final controller. The\\nsame held true for terminated operations. If the clearance was accepted, instead of rejected,\\nthe status field changed to Active. The order of the IM clearances in the IM clearance window were based on the runway\\nsequence. This means a new proposal did not always appear at the top of the list but could\\nappear somewhere further down the list based on the lead aircraft sequence number for the\\nrunway. This order was consistent with the order of the TSAS timeline. The text in the window was color-coded to indicate different statuses (shown in Figure 3-24 and\\nsummarize with other information in Table 3-2 at the end of this section). White text indicated\\nan action was possible (i.e., activation possible). The white text status states were one of the\\nfollowing: Eligible, Eligible No Speed, or Suspended. Green text indicated an IM\\noperation had been accepted by the controller. The status state was Active. Yellow text\\nindicated an action was required (i.e., termination or a maneuver). The yellow text status states\\nwere one of the following: Active Invalid, Active No Speed, Suspended Invalid,\\nSuspended No Speed, or Terminated, Terminated Invalid, or Terminated No\\nSpeed. Dark gray text indicated the information was going to be removed (based the proposal\\nbeing inactive). The dark gray status state was Rejected. Note that the Terminated status\\nwas intended to be dark gray instead of yellow but the mismatch was not detected in time to\\ncorrect the error before data collection. Figure 3-24.

Fields of note will be\\nreviewed next. The clearance types used in the simulation were achieve-by then maintain and capture then\\nmaintain. They were abbreviated as Achieve and Capture for brevity in the display and\\nwhen issuing the clearance over the voice frequency. The ASG in the spacing goal field, was\\ncalculated by TBFM and was the trail aircraft STA at the ABP minus the lead aircraft STA at the\\nABP. The ASG had an IM aware buffer reduction of 0.1 NM based on the expected low\\nspacing variance provided by IM (as compared to metering only operations). The ASG was\\npresented with a 1-second resolution. Next to the ASG was a spacing prediction value in parentheses (shown in some scenarios).\\nBenson et al. (2011) and Aligne et al. (2003) reported that controllers found the predicted\\ninterval at the ABP to be useful. It may become more critical as the ABP is close to or within a\\ncontrollers airspace, as was the case for this simulation. Peterson et al. (2012) also reported\\ncontrollers finding it useful to having delay information. However, only a slight majority of\\ncontrollers reported that the MTE was useful for maintaining awareness of IM operations. Since\\nthis information is not available in the TRACON with TSAS, it was added with the granularity\\nreduced to second (from a minute shown in en route). For achieve operations, the difference\\nbetween the TSAS-calculated trail aircraft ETA at the ABP and the lead aircraft ETA at the ABP\\nvalue was shown. For capture operations, the difference between the TSAS-calculated trail\\naircraft ETA at the FAF and the lead aircraft ETA at the FAF value was shown. These values were\\nprovided to allow the controllers to compare the spacing estimated by TBFM / TSAS (ETA\\ndifferential / prediction) to the ASG and to determine how the operation was progressing. After the lead aircraft identification in the lead aircraft field, the sector of the lead aircraft was\\nincluded if both aircraft were not in the same sector (in case coordination between the\\ncontrollers was necessary). The ABP was either DERVL (the merge point) or YOKXO (the FAF and\\nRNP RF turn final approach intercept) (later shown in Figure 3-32). The lead aircraft route was\\nthe IFPI of the lead aircraft. If it was a capture operation, the lead aircraft route was not shown\\nsince it is a requirement that both aircraft be on the same route to conduct",
