  "text": "simultaneous visual approaches to the CSPRs cannot be \\nconducted, the airport operations change from a two-runway operation to a single runway \\noperation, with a consequent significant loss of throughput2. To regain some of this lost \\nthroughput, reduced separation standards and procedures have been developed for airports \\nwith CSPRs in MMC and IMC operations. The following describes the various available CSPR \\noperations in each type of meteorological condition. Good VMC. Side-by visual approaches at CSPR airports can be conducted down to visual \\napproach minima. Controllers vector aircraft, or procedures are developed, to deliver aircraft to \\ntheir respective final approach courses separated with 1000 ft vertical or 3 nautical miles (NM) \\nlateral separation. When the trail aircraft can provide and maintain visual separation with the \\nparallel traffic, vertical or lateral separation is discontinued and each aircraft is cleared for an \\napproach3. Any weight class (excluding Super) may be the lead of a pair; the only requirement is \\na Heavy/Boeing 757 (B757) may not pass any other aircraft once inside the Final Approach Fix ii\\n the runway thresholds within 0 0.25 NM of each other. (FAF). Also, a large weight class aircraft may not pass a small weight class aircraft. MMC. When cloud layers or other visual obscurations keep aircraft from sighting each other \\nbelow visual approach minima, Simultaneous Offset Instrument Approaches (SOIA) procedures \\ncan be used to reduce separation between parallel arrivals to CSPRs (FAA, 2018c). SOIA \\nprocedures are instrument approaches with a visual segment after the FAF. The visual segment \\nis designed for the trail aircraft of a pair to sight and provide pilot-applied visual separation \\nrelative to a lead aircraft. Sufficient ceiling and visibility are required to allow visual acquisition \\nto occur, which are typically low VMC minima. SOIA normally uses a straight-in ILS approach for the lead runway and an offset localizer or Area \\nNavigation (RNAV) approach for the trail runway, as shown in Figure 2-1 reproduced from FAA \\n(2018c). Shortly before the runway, the trailing aircraft turns to join the final and visual \\nseparation is then established for the remainder of the approach. If visual contact has not been \\nmade by the turn point, the trailing aircraft must execute a missed approach procedure. As with \\nthe good VMC operation, any weight class other than a Super may lead a SOIA pair, and there is \\nno passing inside the FAF. Aircraft are delivered to their respective final approach courses \\nseparated 1000 ft vertically or 3 NM laterally. Once both aircraft are established on their \\nrespective final approach courses, they are cleared for the approach and vertical separation is \\ndiscontinued. Figure 2-1. SOIA Concept from FAA (2018c) Due to the relatively short distance between the final approach courses, SOIA operations \\nrequire a 2000 ft wide No-Transgression Zone (NTZ) between them. Monitor controllers use Image: FAA Order 8260.3D iii\\n 4 The airports are: BOS, CLE, EWR, MEM, PHL, SEA, SFO, and STL. They are in regular use at SFO, though their use at the other \\nairports is not as prevalent. Precision Runway Monitors (PRMs) or Final Monitor Aid (FMA) to monitor aircraft position \\nrelative to the NTZ, and must use an override frequency for communications. If an aircraft \\ndeviates from its final approach course toward the NTZ, the controller must advise the flight \\ncrew that they are off course and to return to the final approach course. If the aircraft does not \\ncomply and enters the NTZ, the other aircraft of the pair is issued a traffic alert and is vectored \\naway from the deviating aircraft. In the event of such a time-critical PRM breakout instruction, \\nthe Monitor controller overrides the Final controller on the PRM frequency. Therefore, these \\noperations require flight crews to tune their radios to both the final approach frequency and a \\nsecond monitor frequency. IMC. When weather conditions do not allow visual separation or SOIA procedures between \\narrivals on CSPRs, aircraft must land single-file to one runway or they may be staggered to each \\nof the parallel runways. While both runways are used in this configuration (by alternating arrival \\nrunways, for example), the resulting arrival throughput is effectively the same as if operating to \\na single runway. However, FAA Order 7110.308C allows for reduced diagonal separation on the \\nparallel final approach course if certain weather and weight restrictions are met (FAA, 2018b). For the 7110.308C procedure, as with the VMC and MMC procedures, aircraft are delivered to \\ntheir respective final approach courses separated by the standard 1000 ft or 3 NM. Once \\nestablished on their respective courses, each aircraft is cleared for an approach and standard \\nlateral and vertical separation are discontinued. The diagonal separation for this dependent pair \\ncan be as low as 1 NM at certain airports. Standard radar or wake turbulence separation must \\nbe provided to the next aircraft to follow a dependent pair. These approaches may be \\nconducted down to CAT I minima; however, a Super, Heavy, or B757 may not lead a dependent \\npair. No Monitor controllers are required for these dependent approaches. Though helpful, the 7110.308C and SOIA procedures have restrictions that limit how often they \\ncan be used and how close the aircraft can get from each other. The 7110.308C operation is \\ncurrently only available at eight airports4 in the NAS, the leading aircraft must be a large or small \\nweight category, and the closest possible intra-pair diagonal spacing is 1 NM. The SOIA \\noperation requires specialized ground equipment, NTZ monitoring, an offset approach, special \\nflight crew training, and a visual segment during the final portion of the approach. The visual \\nmaneuver with SOIA involves first a bank towards the parallel final, followed by a bank away \\nfrom the parallel final. During this time, aircraft structure can interfere with the flight crews \\nability to maintain visual contact with the aircraft on the parallel final. SOIA is currently only \\navailable for SFO and Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport (CLE). At SFO, it is authorized for \\nuse down to a ceilings and visibility of 1400 ft and 4 miles. However, the SOIA procedure at SFO \\nhas been replaced with 7110.308C procedures, which are more predictable, deliver about the \\nsame aircraft arrival rate, and requires fewer controllers and less specialized equipment. SFO is \\nable to attain an arrival rate of 36 with 7110.308C, which is still a considerable decrement from \\nits rate of 54 for visual operations. The IM PA operation is intended to help close this gap. Concept Overview3.2\\nPA is one of several applications of IM. This section first summarizes the general concept of IM. \\nThen, the specifics of the IM PA application are discussed in greater detail. iv\\n Interval Management3.2.1\\nIM is intended to enable an increase in the reliability and accuracy of the spacing interval \\nbetween an IM Aircraft and its Target Aircraft than is possible from a ground system alone. A \\nmore accurate and reliable spacing interval can support a decrease in spacing buffers, which in \\nturn increases throughput during high-demand arrival operations (Bone & Mendolia, 2018). \\nOther advantages include increased predictability of the overall arrival flow, which should \\nincrease the number of aircraft that remain on their RNAV arrival procedures. This also reduces \\nthe number of speed assignments needed to manage the arrivals, thereby reducing \\ncommunications and workload. An overview and history of IM is available in Barmore, et al. \\n(2016). As described in Penhallegon & Stassen (2018), a general IM operation involves an air traffic \\ncontroller, assisted by automation as needed, clearing an IM-capable aircraft to manage a \\ndesired time or distance-based spacing interval (termed Assigned Spacing Goal), relative to a \\nspecified Target Aircraft. Two types of spacing goal behavior have been defined by RTCA \\n(2019b). The first, termed Achieve, has the IM Aircraft achieve the Assigned Spacing Goal by a \\ndesired location, termed the Achieve-by Point (ABP), within 10 seconds (sec) across 95% of IM \\nAchieve operations. The second behavior, termed Maintain, has the IM Aircraft manage its \\nspeed to stay within +/- 10 sec of the Assigned Spacing Goal for at least 95% of the operation on \\na specified route segment. When the flight crew receives the IM Clearance, they enter its information into their on-board \\nFlight-deck IM avionics (termed FIM Equipment), which then starts providing speed guidance \\n(termed IM Speeds) to help them achieve and/or maintain the desired spacing. The flight crew \\nthen follows the IM Speeds until the IM operation is terminated either by a controller or at \\nspecified location, termed the Planned Termination Point (PTP). An IM operation begins immediately after a controller provides all the IM Clearance information \\nat once and the flight crew accepts. Alternatively, a controller may issue a Partial IM Clearance. \\nA Partial IM Clearance contains all required IM Clearance information except the Assigned \\nSpacing Goal. This allows a flight crew to prepare the FIM Equipment before IM is intended to \\nbegin. For terminal IM operations, this should allow an en-route controller to transmit IM \\ninformation using Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) possibly during a less busy \\nphase of flight for the flight crew.
