From a data tracking perspective, it is important to not only enter the planned value or objective, but the value that is actually achieved. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212 As discussed previously, phrasing strategic questions about the data helps to consider whether the data set is sufficient to answer those question, and therefore identify what additional data might be necessary that was not collected or identified previously. Examining the sample text and data fields, we can hypothesize the questions that might be important, and then check to see if the data supports them. For a single program, we might ask: a) How long are the missions for this system? \\nb) What is the mix of easily fixable problems vs Critical mission failures \\nc) What is the overall down-time for the mission from this MTBF and MTBCOMF? \\nd) What levels are being achieved now, compared to the value projected or planned? \\ne) Has there been a change in the projected or tested value since the last report? Overall the data is not fully supporting these questions, as the change since last report is not included, and the level being achieved is not tracked, only the planning value that is expected. Reviewing at the sample text, and imagining that the data for dozens or hundreds of programs is available, we can ask a different set of questions, such as: a) What are the common program data types or values that correlate to the programs that are \\nnot achieving their expected value? What makes some programs more likely to not meet their objectives at a significant level or manner? b) What is the overall trend over several years in achieving projected values? \\nc) How do programs or users compensate when projected values are not fully achieved? \\nd) Did programs that didnt meet their thresholds know that was coming? If so, what were they doing about it? Based on these questions, then we can add data fields, as long as the additions do not seem too onerous or expensive to collect. Fields that might be added here include: a) Change in value since the last reporting. \\nb) Actual Performance Achieved. \\nc) Standard deviation for the key parameter. \\nd) Actions taken to correct negative trends. This analysis is possible for every paragraph of these major procurement plans and documents, and could help move each text based response away from a set of long descriptive sentences and into a set of data fields that will provide the answers to key questions, often phrased as the W questions. These are why, what, who, when, which, where, and how. This could cause a significant increase in the number of data fields, but also allows comparative analysis of the project from a data and metric perspective. For the near term, the first step is to move away from piles of paper and documents files in a smooth and easily understood manner, and shift toward files of data. For this to happen in a smooth manner, and to allow project using data base methods to start using a new process soon, the methodology should be familiar and easy to understand and transition. This implies that blocks of text type responses are preferred at this time. In the long term, perhaps starting FY20, Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212 other community stakeholders should be consulted in moving additional text fields into data type responses where appropriate, and identifying new report formats to capture a subset of text in a short and condensed manner that makes sense. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212 An Electronic Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (E-LCSP). \\nThe Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP) was also analyzed to consider the utility in shifting to an electronic data-based format. The LCSP is actually very amenable to this shift, as it primarily consists of tables of data in each section. This allowed a relatively rapid assembly of a prototype E-LCSP that can be packed into a data based form. The results of the conversion for the program-based are shown in Appendix E. Several data fields were also created from the LCSP instruction that were subsequently identified as either redundant or less valuable if a data based approach is being used, which are also shown in Appendix E. The LCSP also requires key data sets be provided for lower-level components and then again separately for each analysis method used. These are also shown in the Appendix. Like the TEMP, this leads to nested tables, which are accomplished by a unique code for each project. One possibility for this unique identifier is to use the budget Program Elements, then add an additional key code to that. Other examples might be a T Distribution Unlimited.

Public Release Case Number 18-2212 Cybersecurity Strategy & Program Summary \\nThe Cybersecurity Strategy and its attached Program Summary was also converted into a data base format to asses sits functionality in a data base schema. The summary report is document is a 3 page checklist of yes /no data, and relatively simple to convert to a data base format. The header for each data field, however, was very lengthy and had to be shortened to allow simple tracking in a Sharepoint list, as that is always shown in a horizontal manner, not a vertical manner. The resulting data ingest form however, was modified to include the full header text as an instruction, as shown in the Figure 7-1. For this data the 91x series of indices was chosen.

Public Release Case Number 18-2212 Other Acquisition Documents \\nThe AS, AP, TEMP, LCSP, and Cyber Security Strategy are the primary acquisition authorization documents to start a new program of record, after which an Acquisition Program Baseline and Acquisition Decision Memorandum are created. In order to minimize the amount of planning to a minimum level for projects that are supposed to be moving quickly, it is advisable to minimize the number of plans and documents needed for a new program using data- base methods. The Defense Acquisition University (DAU) provides an online tool that indicates which documents are needed for to authorize a program of record. This was converted to a static Excel File, and is shown below in Table 8-1. Some of these documents are not applicable to certain projects (e.g. the Spectrum Allocation document, which probably do not apply to a logistics software project). Those that are less common should be reserved to last place in efforts to create streamlined methods. The documents that apply to almost all of the projects, such as a Test Plan, were emphasized. A pilot program using data-driven methods could start as soon as the summer of 2018, in which case not all methods can be re-invented that fast, and even if they could the ongoing efforts to adjust, help users, solve problems, and test utility will all take time and imply a limited number of data driven conversions in the near term. Each of these documents was assessed for whether they should be converted to either a data-base method or a common template document method (e.g. RTI AP), and whether that should occur in the initial pilot program (phase 1 use) or later in a fully implemented system (aka phase 2 use). The results of this analysis for the STATUTORY requirements are shown in Table 8-2, and the results for the REGULATORY requirements are shown in Table 8-3. As seen, by leveraging the AS, AP, LCSP, TEMP, and Cyber plans in a data driven mode, all of the data needed to create a program of record are captured. The recommended approach includes phased implementation of program workflows for both data-based management methods and automated routing of legacy type documents, primarily those of external organizations. Table 8-1 below provides the phasing of the recommended implementation for creating automated data-based versions of the required statutory and regulatory program documents. Of the 9 phase-w workflows, 3 have already been prototyped, and three of the remaining items are quite small (the acquisition program baseline, the decision memorandum, and the exit criteria). This leaves the AS, Cybersecurity Strategy, and RFP appendix as still requiring data base list and workflow design efforts. The workflows created to route a legacy style document (uploaded as an attachment) is also quite minimal.
