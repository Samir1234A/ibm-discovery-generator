  "text": "the effect of delaying or routing flights around blocked \\nairspace on a sample historical set of days similar to the proposed launch day traffic. This \\napproach requires minimal air traffic domain knowledge however, analysis takes some \\ntime (on the order of 20 minutes), making it unsuitable for use in a what-if analysis. \\nMoreover, the model relies on selecting historical days close to the launch day and is \\ntherefore useful only for assessing relatively near-term impacts. The approach presented in this paper combines insights gained from the earlier work to \\ndevelop a model that predicts impact of blocking airspace on the NAS and encoding the \\nresults in a data structure that can support interactive queries on blocking arbitrary \\nairspace. III. Overview of the Approach The research objective presented in this paper is to enable a user to draw an airspace, \\nanywhere on a map, indicate time window for which it is blocked, and instantaneously \\nreceive metrics indicating the effect on airlines of blocking it. A user may move, reshape, or \\nchange the closure times of the airspace, and the changes in impact are instantaneously \\nreflected. In effect, it is envisioned that the geographical map is geo-coded with NAS \\nimpact information, which is then used to provide a real-time assessment of the impact. One of the key requirements for achieving this vision is to develop a geo-coded data \\nstructure to store aggregated projected or historical traffic data. The data structure referred \\nto as route segment is used for this purpose; a route segment is a line segment between \\ntwo known fixes or waypoints. Since traffic within the NAS changes from moment to \\nmoment, it needs to be aggregated for a unit of time; for this model, the unit selected is one \\nhour. The route segments carry bidirectional traffic density, aggregated hourly; thus, \\ncreating a route segment density map over the geographical area of interest. The route \\nsegment density map enables a what-if analysis paradigm, since the traffic density \\ninformation in the route segments intersecting any arbitrary airspace can be used to assess \\nthe impact instantaneously. To generate the route segments, the flown flight path is reverse-\\nengineered into the known fixes and slotted to the hourly bins, depending on the time when \\nthe flight was in the route segment. Once the data structure used to store projected (or historical) traffic density is designed, \\nthe next step is developing the model for traffic projections. If reliable traffic forecasts were \\navailable 12 months in advance, then they could have been the basis of projected NAS 5 4 Innovata is source of airline schedule data covering over 800 carriers worldwide. http://www.innovata-llc.com/ impact of blocked airspace. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Flight schedules databases, such \\nas the one from Innovata 4, exist, but they do not contain information on general aviation \\nand many business jet flights, which together form a significant portion (approximately 20 \\npercent) of U.S. traffic. Moreover, the database only provides flight schedules between city \\npairs, and not the expected path (trajectory) of the flights, which are required to model the \\neffect of closed airspace on the NAS. Trajectories may be generated using flight schedules as \\nan input to fast-time traffic simulation system such as DART; however, such an approach \\nrequires operator knowledge of the air traffic domain, availability of other data (such as \\nweather), and setup time, which makes it unsuitable for our purpose. In the absence of a traffic forecast, an approach that applies heuristic methods to project \\ntraffic is used. The forecasting model is based on analysis of historical traffic trends \\ncombined with known flight schedule patterns. Traffic flows at different locations for \\nmultiple years are studied to uncover trends by aggregating the data at different levels \\n(daily, weekly, and monthly). An important part of this research is to develop a prototype implementing the model and \\ntesting the extent to which the goals of enabling a what-if analysis have been \\naccomplished. Notes on implementation and the user interface are also part of this paper. To summarize, the key steps in the research to enable an on-demand assessment of air \\ntraffic impact of blocking airspace are: Devise a data reduction and encoding scheme to enable a geo-spatial what-if analysis.\\nDevelop an air traffic projection model. Model the NAS impact of blocked airspace. IV. Data Sources and Scope This research is relevant to locations worldwide; however, due to data and resource \\nlimitations, it has been confined to airspace in the continental U.S. airspace only, specifically \\nto a region bounded by Latitude 10N to 50N and Longitude 40W to 160W. Note that since \\nthe key approach discussed in this paper relies on heuristic methods and historical traffic \\npatterns, it would need to be adapted for use elsewhere, as these will vary from one region \\nto another. The data source used to generate historical track data is Aircraft Situation Display to \\nIndustry (ASDI) feed provided by the Traffic Flow Management System (TFMS) as a System \\nWide Information Management (SWIM) service. The feed allows real-time air traffic data to \\nbe disseminated to members of the aviation industry and includes aircraft scheduling, \\nrouting, and positional information covering flights traversing the scope of this study. It \\ndoes not contain the flights using Visual Flight Rules or military flights. 6 The actual flown track data is generated using the track position report (TZ) messages and \\nis augmented by the oceanic messages (TO) for portions of track that are over the ocean in \\nthe non-radar airspace. In the event a gap of more than 20 minutes is present between two \\nnodes, an interpolated node is inserted, along with the great circle path, in the middle at the \\nsame altitude as the prior one to ensure continuity in the track. The historical track data comprising all tracks from 2011 to 2016 is used in this study. V. Data Reduction and Encoding Scheme A key objective of this research is to achieve the ability to get instantaneous metrics on the \\nNAS impact of blocking an arbitrary airspace, for any length of time. This requires that the \\nhistorical and projected traffic information be stored in a geocode data structure, which \\nwhen combined with blocked airspace coordinates and activation time is able to produce \\nthe NAS impact metrics. There are readily available aggregated \\nhistorical track data sets including number of \\ndaily flights between city pairs. This data set \\nwill not suffice as the flights between a city pair \\nmay follow different paths. For example, Figure \\n1 shows flight paths from New Yorks John F. \\nKennedy Airports to Miami International \\nAirport on March 3, 2017. A blocked airspace \\nlocated at positions A, B, or C will impact a \\ndifferent number of flights, as is evident from \\nthe figure. The variation in the number of \\nimpacted flights will rise for longer distance \\nflights, as there may be more routes connecting \\nthe origin and destination and a larger range of \\nflight durations. It is apparent that the track data needs to be collected between points that are nearer and \\ndo not have multiple paths between them. We use fixes and waypoints along tracks to \\naggregate tracks. These are more closely spaced, with well-known points common to many \\nflight paths. A flight track is split into several route segments, each bounded by a pair of \\nnodes that are typically fixes and/or waypoints. An aircrafts flight plan can be a starting point to splitting a track, as it has the intended \\nroute of a flight in terms of fixes and waypoints. In practice, however, the path deviates \\nsignificantly from the flight plan. Analysis of track data from August 1, 2015, revealed that \\n33 percent of flights deviated from the last filed flight plan by 25 nautical miles (NM) or \\nmore. To address this, the actual flight track is snapped to the closest fixes and waypoints it \\npasses over, in effect reverse engineering the flown flight plan. Since fixes and waypoints \\nare generally not available over oceans, a grid of intersection points one degree apart Figure 1. Flight Paths from JFK to MIA on March 3, \\n2017 7 (going north-south and east-west) is created to cover such locations. In addition, since the \\nset of fixes and waypoints in use changes over a long period (six years used in this study), \\nonly currently used fixes and waypoints are used to create route segments. After the tracks are split into route segments, the number of times each route segment is \\ntraversed every hour is recorded as its traffic density; a collection of traffic density for all \\nthe route segments make up a route segment density map. Finally, an algorithm to assess \\ntraffic blocked by any arbitrary airspace projected over the route segment density map is \\ndeveloped and tested. To summarize, the following are the steps to reduce and encode track data to support what-\\nif analysis capability: Create a database of nodes of frequently used fixes, waypoints, and one-degree latitude and longitude grid points.\\nAlign flight tracks to the nodes to infer the flown flight route and generate route segments.\\nAggregate traversal of route segments by",
