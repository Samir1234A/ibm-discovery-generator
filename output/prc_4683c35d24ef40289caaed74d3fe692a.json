  "text": "and Manufacturing6.4.3\\nEarlier phases of the acquisitions lifecycle shift the focus from materiel assets to data assets, \\nincluding mission system architecture, design, and development documents and specifications. \\nChanges made to these softer components will have an impact on the actual design and \\nproduction of the final components. \\nIt is during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase that the custom system \\ncomponents are functionally specified, designed, built, and initially tested. In our example, the \\nWLAN CSfC is developed using commercial solutions, so we do not have to worry about the \\nsupply chain threats to customized or unique component development. If we did have such a xxxvi component, it would most likely be a critical component and be at the top of the list as having the \\nlargest mission risk. Therefore, our example will focus largely on preserving the integrity of the \\nengineering and design decisions, rather than new capability development.\\nTable 9 contains sample answers to the question of which supply chain threats pose the biggest \\nmission risks during the Engineering and Manufacturing phase.\\nTable 9. Supply Chain Threats and the Associated Mission Risks (Engineering and Manufacturing) Supply Chain Threat Mission Risk\\nModified hardware, firmware, and software \\ndesigns and components for critical components Risks across confidentiality, integrity, and \\navailability vectors WLAN CSfC developed from commercially \\navailable solutions for hardware, firmware and \\nsoftware Minor Risk Adversaries would have a hard time \\ntargeting a specific organization and would have \\nto compromise the product across its entire user \\nbase, increasing the likelihood of detection Table 10 contains sample answers to the question of how to improve the mission system to \\nmitigate the most damaging supply chain attacks and compromises during the Engineering and \\nManufacturing phase.\\nTable 10. Mitigating the Impact of Supply Chain Attacks and Compromises on the Mission System (Engineering and Manufacturing) Cyber Resiliency \\nTechnique Application Substantiated Integrity Preserve the integrity and provenance of data assets (e.g., \\ndocumentation, design, firmware, software). Substantiated Integrity in \\ncombination with \\nRedundancy Use distributed version control. Encourage contractors and vendors to use \\ndistributed, triple entry accounting [21] approaches to provide integrity-\\nassured version management, which can be combined with digital \\nsignatures to provide a cryptographically tamper proof chain of custody \\nfor soft assets Dynamic Positioning, \\nDiversity Give preference to individual components over integrated solutions. \\nStovepipe engineering and manufacturing efforts enables the acquisition \\nto compartmentalize knowledge, making it harder for the adversary to \\nunderstand and compromise the entire mission system design. For \\nexample, the WLAN acquisition may prefer to purchase the WLAN \\ncontroller and wireless access points from different vendors rather than \\nas a package Diversity Use distributed processing across multiple hardware platforms. \\nDistributed processing decouples the command execution from the \\nspecific operational data flow. Distributing the processing, makes it \\ndifficult for an adversary to precisely target a specific capability or \\nalgorithm through supply chain hardware modification. Additionally, the \\nredundancy requires an adversary to compromise exponentially more \\nsystems to increase operational impact Redundancy Use redundant processing paths for critical capabilities. Compare the \\nresults of critical, repeatable and consistent algorithms across multiple \\nruns on multiple platforms. By performing a calculation multiple times \\nwith the same input, it is easy to spot discrepancies in the results, xxxvii indicating a potential loss of supply chain integrity Table 11 provides sample answers to the question of how to improve the recovery of and evolve \\nthe capability of the mission system against future supply chain attacks during the Engineering \\nand Manufacturing phase. Table 11. Improving Recovery and Evolution of the Capability Against Future Supply Chain \\nThreats (Engineering and Manufacturing) Cyber Resiliency \\nTechnique Application Adaptive Response Adopt industry standards. The use of industry standards and supporting \\nproducts can accelerate recovery and system evolution through the \\npromotion of standardized capabilities and communications. This allows \\nproducts to be more easily switched to ones with less supply chain risk, \\nwithout major impact to the system. These standards usually come with a \\nlarger user community and vendor interoperability testing, providing \\nadditional levels of supply chain mitigations and assurances. In the WLAN CP, \\nthis could mean leverage standard authentication protocols (e.g., Extensible \\nAuthentication Protocol (EAP), 802.1X, Kerberos), IPSec VPNs, and \\nInformation Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) or ISO/IEC 20000 \\ncompatible management frameworks. Dynamic Positioning Prefer swappable components. Some components are more easily replaced \\nwith alternatives. For example, the WLAN wireless access points are probably \\neasy to change. Similarly, most software can be run on a variety of hardware \\nplatforms, which can be quickly swapped in case of a supply chain threat. \\nThere are also swappable hardware components, such as disk drives and \\nother chassis. Diversity Evaluate potential hardware and software alternatives. If a supply chain \\nthreat is realized, a standby list of potential alternatives will improve recovery \\nspeed. For higher risk, higher threat environments, it may be beneficial to \\nperform and maintain some level of regular functionality and integration \\ntesting for one or two alternatives during sustainment Technology Development & Materiel Solutions Analysis6.4.4\\nThe earliest, pre-systems acquisition phases are primarily focused on data and documents, \\nnamely requirements and metrics such as key performance parameters (KPPs) and key system \\nattributes (KSAs). This focus limits the number of people, organizations, and technologies, \\nsignificantly limiting the attack vectors available to supply chain adversaries. However, any \\nsuccessful attacks could have far reaching implications through all subsequence acquisitions \\nphases, including Operations & Sustainment.\\nTable 12 contains sample answers to the question of which supply chain threats pose the biggest \\nmission risks during the Technology Development and Materiel Solutions Analysis phases xxxviii Table 12. Supply Chain Threats and the Associated Mission Risks (Technology Development and \\nMateriel Solutions Analysis) Supply Chain Threat Mission Risk\\nModified requirements document can lessen the \\nrobustness, security, and resiliency of the overall \\nmission system and any custom components can reduce the robustness, security, and \\nresiliency of the overall mission system and any \\ncustom components Table 13 contains sample answers to the question of how to improve the mission system to \\nmitigate the most damaging supply chain attacks and compromises during the Technology \\nDevelopment and Materiel Solutions Analysis phase.\\nTable 13. Mitigating the Impact of Supply Chain Attacks and Compromises on the Mission System (Technology Development and Materiel Solutions Analysis) Cyber Resiliency \\nTechnique Application Substantiated Integrity Preserve the integrity and provenance of documentation and related \\nrequirements for both mission system and contractor performance. Substantiated Integrity in \\ncombination with \\nRedundancy Use distributed version control. Encourage contractors and vendors to use \\nand audit integrity-assured version management, which can be combined \\nwith digital signatures to provide a cryptographically tamperproof chain \\nof custody for soft assets Substantiated Integrity in \\ncombination with \\nDiversity Diversify development. Develop documents and requirements using a \\nvariety of applications and formats. This minimizes the impacts that an \\nadversary can have by targeting a single document or application. For \\nexample, requirements writing may use a combination of word \\nprocessing, system engineering, and spreadsheet tools from different \\nvendors. An adversary would have to make corresponding changes to \\neach different document to avoid detection Substantiated Integrity in \\ncombination with \\nRealignment Prefer simpler formats. Contrary to diversifying development, many \\napplications use custom binary or complex file formats. These formats \\nmake it difficult to determine and audit changes across versions, and \\nsynchronize revisions across documents. By using simpler, text based \\nformats, acquisitions teams can focus on specific requirements and \\nmaintain a clean provenance trail Substantiated Integrity in \\ncombination with \\nPrivilege Restriction Minimize write access. Limit the number of users with the authority to \\nmake changes to the official versions of the documents and designs Segmentation Segment development efforts. Stovepipe pre-system acquisition \\ndevelopment efforts and compartmentalize knowledge, making it harder \\nfor the adversary to understand and impact the overall mission system \\ndevelopment and requirements Table 14 provides sample answers to the question of how to improve the recovery of and evolve \\nthe capability of the mission system against future supply chain attacks during the Technology \\nDevelopment and Materiel Solutions Analysis phase. Table 14. Improving Recovery and Evolution of the Capability Against Future Supply Chain xxxix Threats (Technology Development and Materiel Solutions Analysis Cyber Resiliency \\nTechnique Application Realignment, \\nAdaptive Response Adopt a composable system architecture. Design the mission system using \\ntechnologies that provide future flexibility, such as virtualization, software-\\ndefined networking (SDN), and other dynamic representation approaches. \\nThe ability to change and adapt the system will make it easier to mitigate later \\nsupply chain threats, as well as improve later engineering and operational \\nflexibility Segmentation Own the data interfaces. Design the system around data services using service-\\noriented architecture (SOA) concepts. The organization should own and \\nspecify the critical data interfaces. By owning these interfaces, an organization \\ncan better define, monitor, and secure the channel (e.g., read/write \\nprivileges, cross-domain validation), while increasing the ability to switch out \\nthe components behind the interface xl xli Next Steps7\\nThis report has presented a general analysis approach for applying cyber resiliency techniques \\nand approaches to the acquisition lifecycle. It focuses on demonstrating how the adversary uses \\nthe CAL over the entire acquisition life cycle and the impact on the Operations and Support \\nphase of the acquisition life cycle. The cyber resiliency mitigations are those that can be applied \\nto reduce or eliminate impacts to the operational end",
