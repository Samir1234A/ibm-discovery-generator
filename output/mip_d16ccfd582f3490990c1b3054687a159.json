  "text": "type are applicable to systems under development. Substitution: A complete replacement of a module or component (hardware, software, \\nfirmware) to be integrated into the system with one that has already been tampered with \\nin order to maliciously change its intended function or operation. Modification: Any change of existing design or other information that defines the system \\nunder development. In most cases, the change will be to cause a degradation or weakness \\nin later development or production. The intent of this analysis is to understand and characterize the adversarys goals within the \\nacquisition life cycle. This analysis does not represent the frequency of actual attack steps, but \\ninstead groups the 41 attack steps in relation to the acquisition lifecycle to observe trends in the \\noccurrence of the attack steps and relate them to the adversarys goals. \\nThe breakdown of substitution attack steps across the acquisition life cycle (Figure 6, below), \\nshows that they occur in both the Engineering & Manufacturing Development (15 attack steps) \\nand Production & Deployment (14 attack steps) phases nearly equally. Eleven of those attack \\nsteps occur in both the Engineering and Manufacturing Development and Production and \\nDeployment phases. Access to a component supplier is usually a prerequisite for performing a \\nsubstitution attack step. Understanding the adversarys goal of substituting hardware in the \\nEngineering & Manufacturing Development, Production & Deployment and Operations and \\nSupport phases of the acquisition life cycle, means that resiliency mitigations should be focused \\non hardware integrity and tracking. For an operational network, it can be assumed that some \\nhardware has been compromised. Software as a substitution attack frequently occurs during the \\nOperations and Support phase of the acquisition life cycle as software products are maintained.\\nInsertion can be directed at software, hardware, firmware or information. The number of attack \\nstepss characterized as insertion (9 attack steps) is smaller than substitution attack steps (24 \\nattack steps). \\nIt is important to note that many of the 41 attacks cited in the sources require some knowledge of \\nthe system under development, the suppliers, the development and production environments, etc. \\nIf access to information is properly controlled, adversarial reconnaissance can be curtailed. iii Operations and Support Production and Deployment Engineering and Manufacturing Development Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction Material Solution Analysis 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 Substitution Insertion Modification Figure 6. Supply Chain attack steps within the Acquisiton Lifecycle iv i Analysis of Applicable Existing Supply Chain Risk Appendix C\\nManagement Guidance \\nThe SCRM controls described in existing guidance and the resiliency mitigations proposed in \\nthis report complement each other as discussed below. Both should be used by SSEs. Below are \\nthe National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) documents reviewed for this task: NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-161 Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for \\nFederal Information Systems and Organizations [5]. This document is a supply chain \\nrisk management overlay for NIST SP 800-53 R4 [20].\\nNIST SP 800-30, Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments [12]\\nNIST SP 800-37, Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework \\n(RMF) to Federal Information Systems [23] \\nNIST Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)199, Standards for Security \\nCategorization of Federal Information and Information Systems, [24] When conducting a risk assessment in accordance with the DoD Program Managers Guidebook \\nfor Integrating the Cybersecurity Risk Management Framework (RMF) into the System \\nAcquisition Lifecycle [24], using NIST SP 800-161 and NIST SP 800-30R10R1, an SSE works \\nwith their customer to assess risk at the mission and information system level. The \\nrecommendations of resiliency mitigations in Section 5 of this paper will guide the SSE to \\ninclude cyber resiliency as one method of risk mitigation. Table 15 below summarizes the \\nactivities an SSE performs when conducting a risk assessment and the complementary activities \\nperformed as part of a cyber resiliency analysis. For a discussion of how cyber resiliency relates \\nto the RMF, see the MITRE white paper The Risk Management Framework and Cyber \\nResiliency [17]. Table 15. Cyber Resiliency Activities Compared to Risk Management Framework Activities Risk Management Framework Activities \\nfor Assessing Risk Cyber Resiliency Analysis Activities Criticality Analysis Determine Mission essential cyber resources and cyber \\nresiliency objectives Analyze Threats and Known Vulnerabilities Analyze adversary capabilities, intent and targeting\\nDetermine likelihood of a threat exploiting \\na vulnerability Address inherent weaknesses in mission/business \\nprocesses, weaknesses in information security, \\narchitecture and cyber defense processes. Determine impact to system/mission Determine impact with a focus on Consequence to \\nMission Accept, Mitigate, Share, Transfer or Avoid \\nRisk Mitigate Adversary TTPs via cyber resiliency techniques Ensure mission and system can anticipate, withstand, \\nrecover from and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, \\nattacks, or compromises on cyber resources The document Key Practices and Implementation Guide for the DoD Comprehensive National \\nCybersecurity Initiative 11 Supply Chain Risk Management Pilot Program provides 32 key ii practices for managing supply chain risks throughout a system design lifecycle [26]. It focuses \\non practices that enable the development and operation of systems to meet their cost, schedule \\nand performance requirements within a globalized market and with active adversaries. The \\naudience is system engineers, program managers, government prime contractors and \\nsubcontractors and those responsible for delivery and supporting systems with supply chain \\nassurance. \\nWe analyzed the key practices against cyber resiliency techniques and discovered where the key \\npractice supports cyber resiliency, is a part of cyber resiliency, has no overlap or is a complete \\noverlap with cyber resiliency. There are four key practices that overlap with cyber resiliency \\ntechniques: Table 16.

Table 17. Cyber Resiliency Techniques Cyber Resiliency Technique Rationale\\nAdaptive Response: \\nImplement nimble cyber \\ncourses of action to manage \\nrisks Optimize the organizations ability to respond in a timely and \\nappropriate manner to adverse conditions, stresses, or attacks, thus \\nmaximizing the ability to maintain mission operations, limit \\nconsequences, and avoid destabilization. Analytic Monitoring: Gather, \\nfuse, and analyze data on an \\nongoing basis and in a \\ncoordinated way to identify \\npotential vulnerabilities, \\nadverse conditions, stresses, \\nor attacks, and damage Maximize the organizations ability to detect potential adverse \\nconditions, reveal the extent of adverse conditions, stresses, or \\nattacks, and identify potential or actual damage. Provide data \\nneeded for cyber situational awareness. Coordinated Defense: \\nManage multiple, distinct \\nmechanisms in a non-\\ndisruptive or complementary \\nway Ensure that failure of a single defensive barrier does not expose \\ncritical assets to threat exposure. Require threat events to overcome \\nmultiple safeguards; in the case of adversarial events, this makes it \\nmore difficult for the adversary to successfully attack critical \\nresources, increasing the cost to the adversary, and raising the \\nlikelihood of adversary detection. Ensure that uses of any given \\ndefensive mechanism do not create adverse unintended \\nconsequences by interfering with other defensive mechanisms. Deception: Mislead, confuse, \\nor hide critical assets from \\nthe adversary Mislead or confuse the adversary, or hide critical assets from the \\nadversary, making them uncertain how to proceed, delaying the \\neffect of their attack, increasing the risk to them of being discovered, \\ncausing them to misdirect or waste their attack and expose their \\ntradecraft prematurely. Diversity: Use heterogeneity \\nto minimize common mode \\nfailures, particularly attacks \\nexploiting common \\nvulnerabilities Limit the possibility of a collapse of critical functions due to failure of \\nreplicated common components. In the case of adversarial threats, \\ncause the adversary to work harder by developing malware or other \\nTactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) appropriate for multiple \\ntargets, increase the chance that the adversary will waste or expose \\nTTPs by applying them to targets for which they are inappropriate, \\nand maximize the chance that some of the defending organizations \\nsystems will survive the adversarys attack. Dynamic Positioning: \\nDistribute and dynamically \\nrelocate functionality or \\nassets Increase the ability of an organization to rapidly recover from non-\\nadversarial events (e.g., fires). Impede an adversarys ability to \\nlocate, eliminate or corrupt mission/business assets, and cause the \\nadversary to spend more time and effort to find the organizations \\ncritical assets, thereby increasing the chance of the adversary \\nrevealing their actions and tradecraft prematurely. ii Dynamic Representation: \\nConstruct and maintain \\ncurrent representations of \\nmission posture in light of \\ncyber events and cyber \\ncourses of action Support situational awareness, enhance understanding \\ndependencies among cyber and non-cyber resources, reveal \\npatterns/trends in adversary behavior; and validate the realism of \\ncourses of action. Non-Persistence: Generate \\nand retain resources as \\nneeded or for a limited time Reduce exposure to corruption,",
