  "text": "of flight deck experiments was conducted in 2002 and is reported in Hebraud,\\nHoffman, Papin et al. (2004). These two evaluations (May and December) were conducted after\\nthe initial small-scale experiment examining feasibility of spacing and the requirements for the\\nCDTI. The setup for the spacing was conducted through the Control and Display Unit (CDU), and\\na CDTI traffic display was placed on the navigation display. In both experiments, pilots reported\\nfavorably on their situation awareness and their active participation in the maintenance of 2 IM is used generically in this section. Not all simulation examined the full capabilities now being defined in\\nnew versions of DO-361 and DO-328A (RTCA, 2015a, 2015b). Most examined only a subset of those capabilities\\nor an early implementation of those capabilities, under different concept names. 2-29 spacing. Flight crews were found to be able to maintain spacing within the tolerances, with few\\nexceptions. For spacing information in the May experiment, the CDTI traffic display included lead aircraft\\nground speed, closure rate to lead aircraft (difference between lead aircraft and ownship\\ngroundspeed), a required spacing arc and a predicted spacing cue (position on trajectory where\\nspacing will be acquired) (Figure 2-14). The predicted spacing cue changed to amber if the\\nspacing was predicted to be outside tolerances. IM speeds were not provided to the flight crew.\\nPilots reporting desiring spacing trend information and IM speeds. Figure 2-14. Navigation Display with IM Information from Hebraud, Hoffman, Papin et al.\\n(2004) First Evaluation [Reprinted from Hebraud, Hoffman, Papin et al., 2004] Based on the findings from the May evaluation, changes were made for the December\\nevaluation. The required spacing arc and the data block information were removed. The CDTI\\ntraffic display now included an IM speed and spacing scale (Figure 2-15). The spacing scale\\nshowed current spacing, required spacing, spacing trend, closure rate, and tolerance margins\\n(Figure 2-16). When current spacing was out of tolerances, the flight crew was alerted. Flight\\ncrews were also prompted with the visual advisory losing spacing when spacing was an issue. 2-30 Figure 2-15. Navigation Display with IM Information from Hebraud, Hoffman, Papin et al.\\n(2004) Second Evaluation [Reprinted from Hebraud, Hoffman, Papin et al., 2004] Figure 2-16. Spacing Scale from Hebraud, Hoffman, Papin et al. (2004) Second Evaluation and\\nHebraud, Hoffman, Pene et al. (2004) [Reprinted from Hebraud, Hoffman, Pene et al., 2004] The majority of pilots reporting that the spacing task could be conducted with the displayed\\ninformation and that the new features were helpful. Pilots reported the new spacing scale was\\nintuitive and useful, though the closure rate information was of little use. Some pilots also\\nthought they focused too much on the new spacing scale while others felt it was well integrated\\ninto their scan. Pilots also reported liking the IM speeds and questioned the relevance of the\\npredicted spacing cue. Finally, pilots reported a worry about focusing on the spacing task\\nrequirements too much when busy or forgetting when no action is needed during a long period\\nof time. A third flight deck evaluation was conducted in 2003 and was reported in Hebraud, Hoffman,\\nPene et al. (2004). The display implementation was very similar to the December 2002\\nevaluation (Hebraud, Hoffman, Papin et al., 2004). This experiment added flashing for the IM\\nspeeds when there was a difference of 7 knots between the IM speed and the current IAS. 2-31 While the December 2002 evaluation prompted the flight crews with the visual advisory losing\\nspacing when spacing was an issue, this experiment changed the visual advisory to either\\nASAS ACCELERATE or ASAS SLOW DOWN. The 2003 evaluation found the spacing task to be acceptable and all pilots reported the spacing\\nas easy. They reported favorably on their active participation in the maintenance of spacing and\\nwere found to be able to maintain spacing within the tolerances with no loss of spacing with\\nthe displayed information. They again reported that spacing scale may have too much\\ninformation and that the closure rate information was of little use. However, pilots reported\\nthe trend information was useful. They noted the flashing of the IM speed was good but that\\nthere should be more alerting. Pilots reported potential fixations on the spacing scale and a\\npossible reduction in monitoring other flight information. After this set of evaluations, the final flight deck requirements were defined by EUROCONTROL\\n(Hoffman, Pene, and Zeghal, 2006). The requirements relevant to the spacing cues are noted\\nbelow. The flight deck implementation shall include the following: Advisory if IM is infeasible (visual alert only during the feasibility check) Advisory if spacing is drifting and may exceed tolerances (visual alert) with message for\\ncorrective action Caution if tolerances are exceeded (visual and aural alerts) with message for corrective\\naction Warning if the clearance cannot be complied with (visual and aural alerts) with reason\\nwhy the clearance cannot be complied with Spacing indicator with current spacing, required spacing, spacing trend, and tolerance\\nmargins in the main field of view (preferably analog representation). Information on where\\nthe ASG will be reached o Note closure rate is excluded Guidance indicator / IM speed in the main field of view 2.5.2.1.2 NASA Research\\nMuch of the early work on in-trail following, spacing, and merging applications was conducted\\nby NASA Langley and was from the flight crew perspective in the terminal environment during\\napproach (e.g., Abbott and Moen, 1981; Williams and Wells, 1986). The work continued under\\ndifferent names and programs. The most relevant recent work is reviewed here. Oseguera-Lohr, Lohr, Abbott, and Eischeid (2002) conducted an IM pilot evaluation in a high-\\nfidelity simulator with active airline pilots. The CDU was used to enter the IM information and\\nprovided relevant information (i.e., lead aircraft identification and groundspeed, current\\nspacing, ASG, as well as current distance to the lead aircraft). The IM speed was provided on\\nthe Electronic Attitude Direction Indicator in association with the standard fast / slow bug (left\\nside of Figure 2-17). New IM speeds were annunciated with a box flashing for 5 seconds around 2-32 the IM speed value. On the Electronic Attitude Direction Indicator, the IM speed was shown\\nimmediately numerically but the fast / slow bug for the IM speed followed a scheduled speed\\nreduction (though the exact method is not described in detail). The IM speed was also shown\\non the airspeed indicator. The navigation display included a highlighted target aircraft along\\nwith its associated flight identification and range in NM, spacing position indicator (aka picnic\\ntable), and history data from the target aircraft (right side of Figure 2-17). It also showed the\\nASG (PDA field) and IM Speed (CMD field). The spacing position indicator showed the\\npredicted spacing relative to the ASG. When the predicted spacing was the same as the ASG,\\nthe apex of ownship fit into the v of the indicator. Figure 2-17. Primary Flight Display (PFD) and Navigation Display with IM Features from\\nOseguera-Lohr et al. (2002) [Reprinted from Baxley et al., 2014] Pilots reported the tools were acceptable. Head-down time was found to be higher than\\ncurrent operations, but acceptable. No major changes were proposed for the display\\nimplementations. In a summary of this work, however, Baxley, Shay, and Swieringa (2014)\\nstated the fast / slow symbology was found to be borderline effective, the speed change\\nnotification should be longer than 5 seconds, and the spacing position indicator received\\nvarying reports of usefulness. As a follow on to Oseguera-Lohr et al. (2002), Lohr et al. (2005) made minor updates to the IM\\ndisplay information (e.g., the IM speed location on the fast / slow indicator was moved to be\\nalongside the bug) and algorithm to conduct a flight test. Information was provided to indicate\\nto the flight crew that the current IM speed was limited due to configuration or procedural\\nreasons. As with the previous activity, the pilots reported the tools were acceptable. Head-\\ndown time was found to be higher than current operations, but acceptable. The authors noted\\nan issue with the spacing position indicator. Although pilots had been told to follow the IM\\nspeeds and only use the spacing position indicator for spacing awareness, they had a desire to\\nquickly drive the aircraft symbol into the spacing position indicator versus following the IM 2-33 speeds, which would progressively get them in the proper position over time. This,\\nunnecessarily, led to additional workload and unnecessary speed inputs. The authors\\nrecommended additional work to refine the IM tools. Prevot et al. (2004) describes a CDTI used by flight crews in their work on trajectory-oriented\\noperations with limited delegation. It is described and shown in greater detail in NASA (2004).\\nFigure 2-18 shows the implementation. The CDTI included lead aircraft identification, ASG,\\nspacing box, and a line between the trail and lead aircraft showing the ASG and 30-second\\nmarkers. The spacing box was green if the trail aircraft was within tolerance but changed to\\nyellow when the aircraft was greater than 10 seconds ahead of the ASG and changed to white\\nwhen greater than 20 seconds behind the ASG. Limited results were found related to the use of\\nthis implementation for IM. Figure 2-18. IM Features on the CDTI from NASA (2004). [Reprinted from NASA, 2004] Barmore, Abbott, and Capron (2005) examined IM with pilots flying a desktop simulator. This\\nsimulation used displays very similar to those used in previous simulations, with a few\\nmodifications (e.g., no fast / slow indicator) and the use of PFDs and navigation displays (Figure\\n2-19). Crews were alerted if the current speed was not within 5 knots",
