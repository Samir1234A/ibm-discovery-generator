However, 3.3% (29/882) of the terminations were from\\nall the achieve-by clearances and 7.1% (19/269) were from all the capture then maintain\\nclearances. The majority (81.3%; 39 of 48) of terminations were terminated by ATC, followed by the pilot\\nresponding to the controllers termination instructions. Thirteen percent (6 of 48) of cases were\\nwhere only the pseudo-pilot or flight crew terminated. In all six cases, the controller either gave\\na speed or told the flight crew to terminate IM, but neglected to make the keyboard entry.\\nFinally, there were 6.3% (3 of 48) cases where only the controller made a keyboard entry to\\nterminate and potentially issued a voice instruction. In all three cases, the pseudo-pilots\\nappeared to have forgotten to terminate IM (but this did not appear to cause any spacing\\nissues). Table 4-15.

These reasons were stated to the\\nobserver or noted in the post-scenario questionnaire by the controller (if they are in a category\\nother than unknown). The perceived potential to increase efficiency / spacing category\\nincludes situations such as those where the controller thought the ASG was too large or that a\\nlead or trail aircraft could be given a vector. It should be noted that some of the actions after\\nthe termination made the traffic situation more complex and created a worse spacing situation\\nthan if the original schedule and sequence had been utilized. However, in other situations it\\nwas possible to space an aircraft closer than the ASG that was provided by TBFM (e.g., 180\\nseconds)11. Approximately half (10 of 21; 48%) of the perceived potential to increase efficiency\\n spacing events could be attributed to one controller who vectored more frequently than\\nother controllers.

The RNP RF\\nturn operation concern were situations where the controller terminated IM based on a\\nconcern for spacing with an aircraft that was part of an RNP RF turn operation. The prefer not\\nusing IM was where a controller preferred to manually manage the speed of the aircraft. The\\nforgot IM active was a situation where the controller issued a speed to an IM trail aircraft\\nafter forgetting the aircraft was flying IM. Observers noted other situations where this\\noccurred, but the pilot reported doing IM and the controller chose not to terminate. Finally, the\\nTrying something category was where the controller stated either he wanted to try a\\nmaneuver to see how IM would react, or to see if an instruction would improve a situation. 11 Large intervals were due to the initial sequence and spacing of arrival aircraft. The TBFM/TSAS schedule does not\\ncontain logic to speed an aircraft up above the profile speed to close up a naturally occurring large gap. 4-23 4.4.4 Flight Crew Reports of Unable\\nIn addition to the controller terminations, there were five participant flight crew reports of\\nunable12. Two were due to receiving an ASG too large message when trying to initiate IM\\n(Table 4-18). Three were made by the flight crews based on the information provided by the IM\\ndisplay information.

Flight crew participants flew the BRUSR1 arrival\\n33% (24 of 73) of the time and EAGUL6 arrival 67% (49 of 73) of the time. The BRUSR1 arrival\\nfrom TRACON entry to touchdown was on average 14.2 minutes (SD=0.8) and the EAGUL6\\narrival 11.5 minutes (SD=1.4) based on the length of flight path for each arrival. The PTP was\\nalways YOKXO. If the lead aircraft was not flying the RNP RF turn (45/73; 62%), the ABP was the\\nmerge point / DERVL. However, when the lead aircraft was flying the RNP RF turn (28/73; 38%),\\nthe ABP was at the FAF / YOKXO and there was no maintain stage. 12 Pseudo-pilots did not have enough information to report unable, so none did so.\\n13 As a reminder, the pilot participants only flew achieve-by then maintain IM type (no capture then maintain). 4-24 4.4.5.1 Frequency of IM Speed Changes\\nTable 4-19 shows the number of speeds received by participant flight crews. The average\\nnumber of IM speeds is shown in Table 4-20. The average number of IM speeds is higher for the\\nachieve-by stage based on the IM aircraft flying for a longer period of time in that stage (on the\\norder of 7 minutes) while the average number of speeds for the maintain stage is less based on\\nthe shorter period of time in that stage (on the order of one minute).

  "text": "value over the course of an approach and a WSL that initially did not apply for \\ncertain aircraft (see Figure 4-6). Several questions were then related to their ability to provide \\nseparation with respect to these limits. The first part of the hypothesis, acceptability, was measured by controller responses to the \\nfollowing Day 1-2 post-run (QT1) question: I could easily assess whether the IM Trail Aircraft \\nwould remain behind the CSL during the approach. As described in Section 5.5.3.1, All Week 2-\\n3 TRACON controllers agreed for both monitor configurations and for All IM PA Tools On and All \\nIM PA Tools Off. The same question was asked with respect to the WSL: I could easily assess whether the IM \\nTrail Aircraft would remain forward of the WSL during the approach, when applicable. \\nAlthough, as described in Section 5.5.3.2, all Week 2-3 TRACON controllers agreed for the \\nCombined Monitor position with IM PA Tools On, a majority (86%) agreed for the Combined \\nMonitor position with IM PA Tools Off. To examine whether there was a statistically significant difference between the CSL and WSL \\nresponses for this question, a three-factor ANOVA test was performed on the Week 2-3 \\nTRACON controller post-run data with respect to safety limit (CSL versus WSL), Monitor \\nconfiguration (Combined versus Separate [28R]), and IM PA Tool configuration (On \\nversus Off). The probability of finding an effect when there was none, alpha (), was set \\nto 0.05. The descriptive statistics (n, M, and variance) for the three main factors are \\nshown in Table 5-72. The ANOVA results are shown in Table 5-73. Table 5-72. Controller Responses to WSL versus CSL Assessment: Factor Summary Factor Level n M Variance\\nSafety Limit CSL 28 90.9 92.7 WSL 28 77.1 662.0\\nMonitor Configuration 28R 28 80.4 446.1 Combine\\nd 28 87.6 379.9 IM PA Tool Configuration Tools Off 28 81.1 635.7\\nTools On 28 87.0 199.0 Table 5-73.

No statistically significant differences were observed \\nbetween Monitor and IM PA Tool configurations or any of the factor combinations. The unanimous agreement for the CSL suggests controller participants did not have an issue \\nwith it changing over the course of the approach. However, the WSL did appear to increase the \\ndifficulty of the monitoring task. Given that no significant difference was found in IM PA Tool \\nconfiguration, the challenge was likely due to the CSL being displayed from the start of the \\noperation versus the WSL only becoming active late in the operation. Therefore, a Pre-\\nActivation feature that starts sooner than that implemented in the HITL would provide \\ncontrollers more information about what to expect and therefore likely reduce the challenge of \\nmonitoring with respect to the WSL. This is consistent with participant comments as reported in \\nSection 5.5.3.2. --------------------------------- The second part of the hypothesis, feasibility, was measured by controller responses to the \\nfollowing Day 2 end (QT3) question: Overall, I was confident that I could assess whether the \\nseparation between the IM Trail Aircraft and their Lead Aircraft would be maintained. As \\ndescribed in Section 5.2.5, the majority (80%) of TRACON controllers agreed. This self-\\nassessment was supported by the objective separation analysis in Section 5.2.5.2, which found \\nonly a single instance of a within-pair IM PA separation violation. Conclusion: This hypothesis is supported by the simulation results. Overall, controllers found it \\nacceptable and feasible to provide PA separation with respect to separation values that change \\nover the course of an approach, given an appropriate tool set. This did not appear to be affected \\nby monitor configuration. H3(RQ3): Controllers will find a WSL Pre-Activation indication and distances to 6.8.3\\nthe CSL and WSL useful, but not minimum requirements. The first part of this hypothesis was measured via responses to questions related to usefulness \\nof the WSL-P and WSL Data Block W features. At the end of Day 2 (QT3) controllers were \\nasked if the WSL-P was useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task. As described in Section \\n5.5.3.2, all (100%) TRACON controllers agreed. In the same questionnaire, half (50%) felt the \\nWSL-P should always be on and half felt that it should be user toggleable (Figure 5-69) for the \\nIM PA monitoring task. Two controllers indicated in comments that aircraft type differences cxi\\n would indicate an active WSL to the controller, which suggests that though helpful, the WSL-P \\nmay be an optional feature. When asked in the same questionnaire if the WSL Pre-Active Indication (W) features were \\nuseful for the overall IM PA monitoring task, TRACON controller responses were variable and a \\nmajority (70%) of TRACON controllers disagreed it was useful, as described in Section 5.5.3.2. To determine if there was a statistically significant difference between controller responses to \\nthe two display elements, a paired-sample T-Test analysis was run on the TRACON controller \\nagreement ratings for the following two questions: The WSL-P was useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task.\\nThe WSL Pre-Active Indication (W) features were useful for the overall IM PA \\nmonitoring task. The descriptive statistics (n, M, and SD) for each question are shown in Table 5-43. The \\nprobability of finding an effect when there was none, alpha (), was set to 0.05. The \\nresults of the two-tailed, paired sample T-Test analysis resulted in a statistically \\nsignificant p = 0.0002. This suggests a significant difference in controller agreement for \\nthe usefulness of the two elements, with controllers appearing to prefer the WSL-P \\ninstead of the WSL Pre-Active Indication (W) feature in the data block. --------------------------------- The second part of this hypothesis was measured via responses to questions related to \\nusefulness of the CSL and WSL Data Block Distance feature. At the end of Day 2 (QT3) \\ncontrollers were asked if the Data Block Distance to CSL was useful for the overall IM PA \\nmonitoring task. As described in Section 5.5.3.1, all but two controllers disagreed. In the same \\nquestionnaire, four of ten controllers rated it as not needed and the others suggested it should \\nbe user toggleable (Figure 5-69) for the IM PA monitoring task. The same question was asked with respect to the WSL Data Block Distance feature: if the Data \\nBlock Distance to WSL was useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task. As described in \\nSection 5.5.3.2, all but two controllers disagreed. In the same questionnaire, four of ten \\ncontrollers rated it as not needed and the others suggested it should be user toggleable (Figure \\n5-69) for the IM PA monitoring task. Conclusion: This hypothesis is partially supported by the simulation results. Controllers did \\nappear to find the WSL-P useful, but not a minimum requirement. However, controllers did not \\nappear to find the Data Block W Indication useful. Almost all controllers also rated the Data \\nBlock Distances to the CSL and WSL as not useful, at least to them. H4(RQ3): A representation of the safety limits and an alert when the IM Trail 6.8.4\\nAircraft begins to encroach on the limits will be useful to Monitor controllers. The first part of this hypothesis was measured via responses to questions related to the \\nusefulness of the safety limit features. As described in Section 5.5.3.1, at the end of Day 2 (QT3) \\nall (100%) TRACON controllers found the CSL Line useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task. \\nIn the same questionnaire, all controllers recommended that the CSL Line always be on (Figure cxii\\n 5-69) for the monitoring task. The results were the same for the WSL Line, as described in \\nSection 5.5.3.2 and Figure 5-69. --------------------------------- The second part of this hypothesis was measured via responses to questions related to \\nusefulness of the longitudinal alerting features. Results were examined with respect to the two \\nlevels of longitudinal alert presented in the HITL experiment: the Predictive Alert and the \\nCaution Alert. As described in Section 4.2.7, controllers were only required to take action in \\nresponse to the Caution Alert. At the end of Day 2 (QT3) controllers were asked if the IM PA Predictive Alert and IM PA \\nCaution Alert features were useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task. As described in \\nSection 5.5.4.1, all (100%) TRACON controllers agreed for the Caution Alert and a majority (90%) \\nagreed for the Predictive Alert. In the same questionnaire, a majority of TRACON controllers \\n(90%) responded that the Predictive and Caution Alerts should always be on (Figure 5-69)",
