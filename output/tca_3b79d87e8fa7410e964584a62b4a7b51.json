  "text": "lists themselves provides evidence pixel weights in each neighborhood list have improved via edge reweighting techniques such that distances (similarities) of pixels like the test pixel are decreased (increased), whereas those unlike the test pixel are increased (decreased). The metric used to perform this analysis was presented in Section IV-A, wherein the structure of the neighborhoods themselves is investigated with respect to cluster uniformity and separation when class labels are available. Seven graph construction techniques making use of edge reweighting were applied to the six images from our previous studies; an eighth, ANN, was used as an unweighted control. Both the weighted rank and improved pixel count metrics introduced in Section IV-A produced effectively the same conclusionthat edge reweighting (post edge selection) is detrimental to the community structure of the neighborhood lists. In short, more pixels had the structure of their nearest neighbor lists degenerate instead of improve. In one case, Indian Pines, upwards of 23% of the ground truth pixels with labels had their community structure decline as shown in Fig 12. The leftmost side of the bars in Fig. 12 is read down and the inset black bar is read up, where the lower and upper x axes are the percentage of pixels with improved neighborhood health scores and the average rank-adjusted scores respectively. Algorithms are labeled to the left and data sets to the right. Some patterns are evident in Fig. 12. ANN occupies six of the top seven positions \\nindicating NN lists are healthier without reweighting. SNN variants are closer to the top of the list showing \\nthe power of counting shared neighbors, but on average, are no better than not reweighting. The most complex scenes (Pavia and PaviaU) occupy \\nmore of the upper positions suggesting there is more relative benefit for complex scenes. Reweighting techniques utilizing codensity typically \\noffer poorer performance. A graph construction method that reinforces inherent community structure facilitates accurate analysis; however in this case it appears edge reweighting, by any method, does not improve community structuresurprising. This is contrary to what may be inferred from other papers [25][29]. However, graph construction methods used in those analyses was always followed by an analysis algorithm, i.e., the viability of the new graph construction technique itself was not the focus of the effort. Results in this section suggest those methods may perform better with a simpler graph construction method; avoiding the additional complexity and computation time. \\nAnomaly and target detection methods rely more heavily on weighted inter-relationships between pixels than classification algorithms. In order to more fully assess graph-construction method impacts on these algorithms, intracluster manifold distance measures and connected component structure will need to be evaluated. This is the topic of a future paper continuing this analysis. \\nFig. 12. Edge reweighting effectiveness plotted as the percentage of valid ground truth pixels with improved weighted-rank scores (post reweighting minus per reweighting) for many edge reweighting methods across six datasets. The upper x axis represents the average rank-adjusted score and is represented by the inset black bars. In nearly all cases, edge reweighting is detrimental to the health of the community structure in the data. IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING, VOL. xx, NO. yy, MONTH 201x.

Case Number 16-3868 \\n 15 Primary Metric Prescaling or Edge Reweighting In Section II, we discussed edge reweighting and primary metric scaling. The former is applied to edges that were previously determined, whereas the latter is applied to primary metrics prior to edge selection; all examples shown thus far are based on reweighting preselected edges. Scaling metrics prior to edge selection facilitates inclusion of other information density and/or shared neighborsin the ranking process, so k- NN lists generated from prescaled primary metrics will differ. Pixels in regions of similar density and spectral similarity should be brought closer together, whereas others are pushed away. As appealing as this may be, it often requires a primary metric for all pairwise distances (or similarities). This takes pGh time so is not feasible even for modest size images \\nunless approximations can be made. However, to be complete, it is reasonable to explore how much performance is potentially sacrificed for speed by performing a primary metric scaling on a full primary metric matrix. The same six images and four graph construction techniques from the first two studies are used to demonstrate differences in the number of intercluster edges resulting from ZMP prescaling and its effect on classification accuracy. Fig. 13 displays differential y-edge ratios plotted against differential confusion \\nscores, where the differentials are taken as the no prescaling ratio value minus the ZMP prescaled values. \\nAs can been seen in Fig 13., scaling the primary distance metric via ZMP prior to graph construction is actually detrimental to the health of neighborhood lists, i.e., most tests display a negative y-edge ratio (quadrants II and III) indicating ZMP prescaling creates more intercluster (fewer intracluster) edges than simply using the primary metric. This is consistent with the results in the previous section, but surprising given the success of density weighting in other fields [27][28]. The Fig 13. Scatterplot agrees with theory, suggesting a positive correlation between differential y-edge ratios and \\ndifferential confusion. The slope of the regression line through these data is 0.51 indicating introduction of some new false edges is tolerable until a noticeable change in confusion ratio is observed. Perfect correlation would only result in population of quadrants I and III in Fig. 13, but given the addition and deletion of edges may or may not change class assignments, we acknowledge differential confusion is variable based on the distribution of edges amongst the pixels. The mutual proximity method with the Gaussian independent assumption performed much worse than the ZMP method indicating the Gaussian assumption is not appropriate for these data, which is to be expected given pixels do not exhibit normal distance distributions despite theoretic asymptotic behavior indicated by the central limit theorem. To explore this concept further, prescaling by mutual proximity with the empirical distribution was tested on the Salinas A and Indian Pines data. Note that empirical mutual proximity uses the distribution of the data itself to determine the probability of pixels being neighbors and is not impacted by user selection of some arbitrary number of neighbors to average. Empirical mutual proximity demonstrated the highest performance of all prescaling methods (albeit, only on par with no prescaling) indicating that perhaps codensity-based measures are not best representation of local scale for hyperspectral data. This result warrants more study given it indicates a potential expectation change compared to previous efforts. Flexer and Schnitzer [28] studied a broad range of public machine learning datasets spanning low to very high intrinsic (hundreds) and extrinsic (thousands) dimensionality. Lower intrinsic-dimensional data in their results displayed a similar occurrence where there can be no gain, and often a reduction in performance for lower intrinsic dimensionality data (however, shown not to be statistically significant in their study). HSI typically exhibits low intrinsic dimension (single digits to tens of dimensions) [8], so it possible we are seeing the same effect here. Their results did show significant improvement for higher intrinsic dimensionality data, so additional testing is warranted on more diverse higher dimensionality data. The choice of edge reweighting or metric prescaling (for appropriate imagery) may be decided by the number of pixels to be analyzed since quadratic run time is often prohibitive for even modest sized images. However, some of these routines execute quicker using fast nearest neighbor routines by first returning a larger number of neighbors than required followed by edge reweighting and subsequent edge selection. V. CONCLUSIONS AND PATH FORWARD This paper has provided a survey of many common HSI graph construction techniques with emphasis on their characteristics related to common hyperspectral analyses. The Fig. 13. Differential y-edge ratio plotted versus the differential confusion \\nscore; differentials are taken as no prescaling minus ZMP density-weighted prescaling. Negative values for either axes indicates prescaling with ZMP is detrimental to neighborhood health. Most scene and graph type combinations shown display a negative y-edge ratio stating more intercluster pixels are \\nconnected by ZMP prescaling.

Case Number 16-3868 \\n 16 shared nearest neighbors and mutual proximity techniques from the data mining literature were also introduced and described along with several variants of those basic techniques. Many graph construction practices were analyzed to reveal characteristics most beneficial to the health of neighborhood lists. Specifically, invoking mutuality was shown to be superior to symmetry for symmetrifying adjacency matrices except in scenes with low complexity. Adaptive density weighted graph- construction methods outperform fixed neighborhood graphs in complex scenes, but also shown to be poor options for scenes with low scene complexity. Advanced reweighting and primary metric prescaling techniques were shown to actually damage the community structure of spectral graphs, so are detrimental to classification tasks. Neighborhood health metrics are good indicators for classification related tasks, but not complete for analyses",
