This \\napproach requires minimal air traffic domain knowledge however, analysis takes some \\ntime (on the order of 20 minutes), making it unsuitable for use in a what-if analysis. \\nMoreover, the model relies on selecting historical days close to the launch day and is \\ntherefore useful only for assessing relatively near-term impacts. The approach presented in this paper combines insights gained from the earlier work to \\ndevelop a model that predicts impact of blocking airspace on the NAS and encoding the \\nresults in a data structure that can support interactive queries on blocking arbitrary \\nairspace. III. Overview of the Approach The research objective presented in this paper is to enable a user to draw an airspace, \\nanywhere on a map, indicate time window for which it is blocked, and instantaneously \\nreceive metrics indicating the effect on airlines of blocking it. A user may move, reshape, or \\nchange the closure times of the airspace, and the changes in impact are instantaneously \\nreflected. In effect, it is envisioned that the geographical map is geo-coded with NAS \\nimpact information, which is then used to provide a real-time assessment of the impact. One of the key requirements for achieving this vision is to develop a geo-coded data \\nstructure to store aggregated projected or historical traffic data. The data structure referred \\nto as route segment is used for this purpose; a route segment is a line segment between \\ntwo known fixes or waypoints. Since traffic within the NAS changes from moment to \\nmoment, it needs to be aggregated for a unit of time; for this model, the unit selected is one \\nhour. The route segments carry bidirectional traffic density, aggregated hourly; thus, \\ncreating a route segment density map over the geographical area of interest. The route \\nsegment density map enables a what-if analysis paradigm, since the traffic density \\ninformation in the route segments intersecting any arbitrary airspace can be used to assess \\nthe impact instantaneously. To generate the route segments, the flown flight path is reverse-\\nengineered into the known fixes and slotted to the hourly bins, depending on the time when \\nthe flight was in the route segment. Once the data structure used to store projected (or historical) traffic density is designed, \\nthe next step is developing the model for traffic projections. If reliable traffic forecasts were \\navailable 12 months in advance, then they could have been the basis of projected NAS 5 4 Innovata is source of airline schedule data covering over 800 carriers worldwide. http://www.innovata-llc.com/ impact of blocked airspace. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Flight schedules databases, such \\nas the one from Innovata 4, exist, but they do not contain information on general aviation \\nand many business jet flights, which together form a significant portion (approximately 20 \\npercent) of U.S. traffic. Moreover, the database only provides flight schedules between city \\npairs, and not the expected path (trajectory) of the flights, which are required to model the \\neffect of closed airspace on the NAS. Trajectories may be generated using flight schedules as \\nan input to fast-time traffic simulation system such as DART; however, such an approach \\nrequires operator knowledge of the air traffic domain, availability of other data (such as \\nweather), and setup time, which makes it unsuitable for our purpose. In the absence of a traffic forecast, an approach that applies heuristic methods to project \\ntraffic is used. The forecasting model is based on analysis of historical traffic trends \\ncombined with known flight schedule patterns. Traffic flows at different locations for \\nmultiple years are studied to uncover trends by aggregating the data at different levels \\n(daily, weekly, and monthly). An important part of this research is to develop a prototype implementing the model and \\ntesting the extent to which the goals of enabling a what-if analysis have been \\naccomplished. Notes on implementation and the user interface are also part of this paper. To summarize, the key steps in the research to enable an on-demand assessment of air \\ntraffic impact of blocking airspace are: Devise a data reduction and encoding scheme to enable a geo-spatial what-if analysis.\\nDevelop an air traffic projection model. Model the NAS impact of blocked airspace. IV. Data Sources and Scope This research is relevant to locations worldwide; however, due to data and resource \\nlimitations, it has been confined to airspace in the continental U.S. airspace only, specifically \\nto a region bounded by Latitude 10N to 50N and Longitude 40W to 160W. Note that since \\nthe key approach discussed in this paper relies on heuristic methods and historical traffic \\npatterns, it would need to be adapted for use elsewhere, as these will vary from one region \\nto another. The data source used to generate historical track data is Aircraft Situation Display to \\nIndustry (ASDI) feed provided by the Traffic Flow Management System (TFMS) as a System \\nWide Information Management (SWIM) service. The feed allows real-time air traffic data to \\nbe disseminated to members of the aviation industry and includes aircraft scheduling, \\nrouting, and positional information covering flights traversing the scope of this study. It \\ndoes not contain the flights using Visual Flight Rules or military flights. 6 The actual flown track data is generated using the track position report (TZ) messages and \\nis augmented by the oceanic messages (TO) for portions of track that are over the ocean in \\nthe non-radar airspace. In the event a gap of more than 20 minutes is present between two \\nnodes, an interpolated node is inserted, along with the great circle path, in the middle at the \\nsame altitude as the prior one to ensure continuity in the track. The historical track data comprising all tracks from 2011 to 2016 is used in this study. V. Data Reduction and Encoding Scheme A key objective of this research is to achieve the ability to get instantaneous metrics on the \\nNAS impact of blocking an arbitrary airspace, for any length of time. This requires that the \\nhistorical and projected traffic information be stored in a geocode data structure, which \\nwhen combined with blocked airspace coordinates and activation time is able to produce \\nthe NAS impact metrics. There are readily available aggregated \\nhistorical track data sets including number of \\ndaily flights between city pairs. This data set \\nwill not suffice as the flights between a city pair \\nmay follow different paths. For example, Figure \\n1 shows flight paths from New Yorks John F. \\nKennedy Airports to Miami International \\nAirport on March 3, 2017. A blocked airspace \\nlocated at positions A, B, or C will impact a \\ndifferent number of flights, as is evident from \\nthe figure. The variation in the number of \\nimpacted flights will rise for longer distance \\nflights, as there may be more routes connecting \\nthe origin and destination and a larger range of \\nflight durations. It is apparent that the track data needs to be collected between points that are nearer and \\ndo not have multiple paths between them. We use fixes and waypoints along tracks to \\naggregate tracks. These are more closely spaced, with well-known points common to many \\nflight paths. A flight track is split into several route segments, each bounded by a pair of \\nnodes that are typically fixes and/or waypoints. An aircrafts flight plan can be a starting point to splitting a track, as it has the intended \\nroute of a flight in terms of fixes and waypoints. In practice, however, the path deviates \\nsignificantly from the flight plan. Analysis of track data from August 1, 2015, revealed that \\n33 percent of flights deviated from the last filed flight plan by 25 nautical miles (NM) or \\nmore. To address this, the actual flight track is snapped to the closest fixes and waypoints it \\npasses over, in effect reverse engineering the flown flight plan. Since fixes and waypoints \\nare generally not available over oceans, a grid of intersection points one degree apart Figure 1. Flight Paths from JFK to MIA on March 3, \\n2017 7 (going north-south and east-west) is created to cover such locations. In addition, since the \\nset of fixes and waypoints in use changes over a long period (six years used in this study), \\nonly currently used fixes and waypoints are used to create route segments. After the tracks are split into route segments, the number of times each route segment is \\ntraversed every hour is recorded as its traffic density; a collection of traffic density for all \\nthe route segments make up a route segment density map. Finally, an algorithm to assess \\ntraffic blocked by any arbitrary airspace projected over the route segment density map is \\ndeveloped and tested. To summarize, the following are the steps to reduce and encode track data to support what-\\nif analysis capability: Create a database of nodes of frequently used fixes, waypoints, and one-degree latitude and longitude grid points.\\nAlign flight tracks to the nodes to infer the flown flight route and generate route segments.\\nAggregate traversal of route segments by",

Agile Acquisition Strategy Definition: Agile acquisition is the strategy, structure, and process to effectively adopt and apply agile software development methodologies. Agile acquisition integrates planning, design, development, and testing into an iterative life cycle to deliver small, frequent, incremental capabilities to an end user. Agile acquisition in government programs requires integrated government and contractor processes and partnerships. It embraces the agile development principles of self-organizing cross-functional teams, frequent capability deliveries, continuous user participation and feedback, and evolving requirements. Keywords: acquisition strategy, agile, agile acquisition, agile development, incremental, uncertainty, rapid MITRE SE Roles and Expectations: MITRE systems engineers (SEs) are expected to understand the fundamentals of agile acquisition, identify when it is appropriate to adopt an agile strategy, and understand how to successfully adopt and implement agile practices for a program. They should understand how systems engineering processes may change within an agile environment and how to tailor them to program constraints and objectives. SEs must understand that the challenges of dynamic development, requirements, and related processes require significant rigor, coordination, and integration. Background Agile development is built around a culture of small, dynamic, empowered teams actively collaborating with stakeholders throughout product development. Agile development requires team members to follow disciplined processes that require training, guidance, and culture change. The agile method does not follow a set of standard waterfall-based prescribed formal processes. Agile methods demand processes specifically tailored for a rapid, iterative, dynamic development approach, especially in the areas of requirements, test, and systems engineering. Agile acquisition can be distilled into four core elements: 1. Structuring the program via small, frequent capability releases \\n2. Valuing working software over comprehensive documentation \\n3. Responding to changes in operations, technology, and budgets \\n4. Actively involving users throughout development to ensure high operational value The foundational structure of an agile program, as depicted in Figure 1, is: Release: Capability delivered to users, composed of multiple sprints \\n Sprint: Priority capabilities developed, integrated, tested, and demonstrated (aka iteration) Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2852. Daily scrum: Team synchronization meeting to plan activities and assess progress and \\nimpediments \\nFigure 1. Basic Agile Structure Enabling an agile acquisition strategy demands some degree of upfront planning and design, but it places importance on beginning development quickly. The fundamental assumption is that requirements, designs, and capabilities will evolve as team members gain information during the development process [1]. When to Use Agile In determining whether an agile acquisition strategy is appropriate for the program, it is critical to evaluate the operational, acquisition, and developer conditions. Agile acquisition strategies should be considered when: The full set of requirements cannot be defined up front, but an initial set can be \\ndetermined, at least for a first release. Requirements can be decomposed into small tasks to support iterative development. \\n Users want smaller, more frequent, iterative deliveries. \\n Users are able to actively engage throughout development. \\n User feedback is used to shape the requirements for future releases. \\n Acquisition processes can be tailored to support smaller, frequent releases. \\n Leadership and stakeholders support an agile acquisition strategy and processes. \\n The government program office has agile trained or experienced individuals, tailored processes, and access to coaches, and developers have agile experience. Users, program office staff, and developers can establish a collaborative environment \\nand are able to collocate or establish an effective virtual working environment. The program can leverage enterprise platforms, processes, and documents for \\ncontracting, development, and test to enable rapid execution. Agile acquisition works best with smaller scoped developments, such as a self-contained application or incremental upgrade to an operational system. Agile can scale to apply to larger development efforts, but this requires additional rigor in technical architecture, coordination across development teams, and integration. It is difficult to develop a large infrastructure system from the start using agile development. The more agile development can leverage an established infrastructure platform, the more autonomy the team will have for their iterative development. A program can use a traditional approach to build an initial increment that meets the baseline Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2852. architecture requirements. Once the program has established a baseline and framed the overall conceptual design, program managers can consider shifting to an agile approach for subsequent releases that build additional functionality into the operational baseline. Best Practices and Lessons Learned Setting up an agile environment. An agile acquisition strategy represents a change in the way the government traditionally conducts business. Programs must rethink how they are staffed, organized, and managed, and they must structure the business processes, governance reviews, and funding models to support agile methods. Agile requires dedicated government involvement throughout the entire process in order to plan and integrate multiple releases, oversee development cycles, manage evolving requirements, facilitate collaboration, and obtain committed, active, and consistent user engagement. The optimal structure to foster a collaborative environment features physical collocation of the acquisition support team, which consists of the program staff, contractor, and supporting functional areas. Constant communication across the team is essential. Most agile methodologies require daily meetings for status, direction, feedback, and assignments. A culture of trust that spans the decision authority, developers, testing organization, acquirers, program management, and users is critical to successful agile delivery. Structuring an agile program. The way a program is structured into releases and sprints from the start can play a key role in its success over the life cycle. Government program managers in consultation with operators and developers must determine the optimal timelines for releases and sprints on the basis of various constraints, risks, and other factors. The primary drivers include how frequently the operational community wants and can integrate new releases, and the ability of the development environment to regularly build, integrate, test, quality assess, and deploy capabilities. Traditional acquisition, contracting, budget, test, and related processes constrain development, but the program should tailor these processes to support smaller, more frequent releases. Active stakeholder engagement and contributions can aid the program in designing the acquisition and development processes to fit the planned structure. Requirements management. The agile methodology embraces requirements change throughout development. Because it is often difficult to define the full set of requirements for systems up front, they can be iteratively identified and shaped along the way. Given the rapid pace of changes in technologies and operational environments, requirements can evolve over time. Active user involvement is needed to inform the development process and provide feedback based on early releases. This gives users the opportunity to add, edit, and delete requirements with sufficient management controls. Requirements are managed via a prioritized product backlog that is typically in a database format, instead of a single document. A product owner from the user community traditionally controls the requirements backlog. The highest priority requirements that can be developed within the set timeframe define the scope of the next release. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2852. Release requirements can be changed during development. Sprint requirements are an agreed-to subset of a release between the users and developers and are locked, preventing changes for this short interim build. See Figure 2. \\nFigure 2. Program, Release, and Sprint Backlogs Systems engineering. In an agile environment, systems engineering requires tailored methods and processes to incrementally deliver capabilities. SEs play a critical role in technical and programmatic integration via disciplined engineering processes. To enable faster, smaller deliveries, enterprise architectures are required to guide system design. Agile systems engineering practices, such as design reviews, are not one time events for the entire system, but rather an iterative process with smaller, more frequent reviews built into each release. It is critical to keep all key stakeholders informed on a regular basis, given the rapid and dynamic nature of the agile environment. Conducting a demonstration of capabilities at the end of each sprint and release is an opportunity to bring users, developers, and other stakeholders together to drive collaboration and decision making. It is important to put in place a clear architecture that is refined over time as sprints and releases are developed. The architecture should be government managed and should involve active collaboration with the contractors developing capabilities governed by it. SEs should periodically hold technical reviews for large elements of the system (broader than any release) to assess designs, performance, and alternatives. SEs should actively partner with testers to ensure active and early involvement in the process and to establish a common set of expectations for outcomes. Architecture. The architecture of the system should have enough flexibility so that capabilities can be designed, added, or modified with functional independence. In other words, the system is architected and designed so that capabilities scheduled for delivery can interoperate with the components that have been delivered and do not have critical operational dependencies on capabilities that have not yet been delivered. Layered architectures lend themselves to this application. Components may be developed for different layers; concentrating on the most commonly used/reused components first. An initial capability for delivery could be a component that",
