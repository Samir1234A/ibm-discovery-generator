  "text": "out the following missions: implementing continuous control of axes in the space domain that are in danger of operations of ground radar stations of the missile -attack warning system; conducting continuous reconnaissance of regions for the launch of ballistic missiles; detecting space objects and cataloging them; controlling space ships in orbital flight and safeguarding the deployment of orbital space ship groupings while maintaining them in a combat-ready condition; and other tasks. Scientific studies should be aimed at the following: taking into account the opposing sides being equipped with new means of armed struggle and the influence of other operational (tactical) factors; and developing operational-tactical requirements for new and modernized complexes and systems.[footnoteRef:99] Thus operational issues are under continuous reevaluation. [99: Kasakhov and Isaev, pp. 30-35.] In 2019, Russian analysts offered a brief description of the Nudol missile defense system. It is designed to repulse a nuclear strike at distant approaches to Russia, and it is being deployed on the ground and in space. There it can strike at satellites and missiles.[footnoteRef:100] Nudol is said to be a two-stage missile, with solid-fuel engines for both stages and a warhead equipped with maneuver engines. Equipped with both a conventional and nuclear warhead, the missile can strike targets at a distance of up to 1500 kilometers and with a speed of intercept of Mach 10. By operating against both missiles and satellites, Nudol can eliminate both reconnaissance and target designation satellites of an opponent, which eliminates them from seeing anything. Moscows layered ballistic missile defense system would thus include satellite groupings, a network of ground-based, long-range radar detections stations, and Nudol, thus becoming an aerospace defense system covering air and space.[footnoteRef:101] [100: Viktor Sokirko, Intelligence Late to Report: US Pinpoints Killer of its Satellites Three Years after the Event. Bad News for the Pentagon: Russia Successfully Testing Nudol System, Svobodnaya Pressa, 20 January 2019.] [101: Dmitriy Popov, The Killer Satellite with a Nice Name: The United States Has Nothing to Counter the Latest Nudol System, Armeyskiy Standart, 25 January 2019.] Finally, also in 2019, President Putin stated that nearly 80 percent of Russias military and dual-use satellites had been replaced.[footnoteRef:102] Defense Minister Shoygu stated that the throughput of communication channels for Russias military satellite grouping will increase 2.5 times by 2025 and will raise their jamming resistance.[footnoteRef:103] Thus, the improvement in space systems is a clear indication of its growing importance. [102: No author or title provided, Interfax, 16 May 2019.] [103: No author or title provided, Interfax (in English), 3 June 2019.] With these concepts as background, a truncated potential lineup of equipment that Russian theorists might consider as components of a space OMG that can maneuver and conduct deep/planetary operations in near or deep space include the following, based on the articles used above:\\nInspector satellites, such as the Kosmos 2521\\nKiller satellites\\nTirada-2s, to thwart communications\\nRudolf, anti-satellite strike system\\nNudol, anti-satellite and missile system\\nPeresvet combat laser\\nGround stations that can jam objects in space\\nMiG-31armed with anti-satellite missiles\\nSpace junk that comes alive\\nReconnaissance-strike complexes and information-strike system\\nGround based hackers who attempt to take control of satellites, such as theoretically occurred in 1998[footnoteRef:104] [104: No author provided, Using the Force, The Economist, 20 July 2019, p. 19.] Conclusions\\nWestern analysts should consider whether the deep operations of operational art normally associated with ground forces are now finding new life in a deep space dimension of Russian planning; and whether the theory is further buttressed by Russias SODCIT (special operations for the destruction of critical infrastructure targets) concept that aims to take out another nations economic base or links to space operations in the initial period of war (IPW). Perhaps Russia has even developed a space OMG, the potential components of which were listed for consideration. What is apparent from just these three points (SODCIT, IPW, OMG) is that Russias military has different focal points of thought than does the West, and they must be considered when developing Western responses to Russian threat indicators in space.\\nRecent Russian military literature has focused primarily on weapons based on new physical principals (NPP), electronic warfare, artificial intelligence, and other weapon-related interests. Yet ever since the 1920s, Soviet and now Russian military theorists have adjusted operational art to new discoveries in weaponry. Operational arts past characteristics of maneuver, breakthroughs, and deep operations are all applicable to space. These developments are taking place at a time and place (space) that has an unfolding environmental context. There are no rules of space warfare that would be equivalent to the rules of land warfare (although many believe space in the interim should abide by land warfare rules until space rules are developed). To date there is only the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 and not a rule of law. The treaty appears to leave much room for interpretation and was, naturally, unable to envision two things: the current space environment that includes commercial and private spacecraft in addition to government developed ones; and its high-technology equipment (lasers, antisatellite missiles, etc.) that is able to do things (inspect other equipment in space, for example) never before considered. \\nThe four officers who wrote longer articles on operational art made references to both operational art and its characteristics, and also discussed the aerospace domain. Korotchenko stated that the growing potentials of air and space warfare are increasingly influencing the theory and practice of operational art.[footnoteRef:105] The prevention of an enemys domination in space is now important and commanders must employ the potentials of our space-based systems to the utmost when preparing operations and waging hostilities[footnoteRef:106] since the course and outcome of operations are dominated by space and missile forces. Maneuver, he noted, is a typical trend of operational art and has a more important role to play under the current advanced technological situation.[footnoteRef:107] Zherebtsov stated that there will be a new perception of operational arts content, to include its principles, forms, and methods of conducting operations under conditions of an information-focused confrontation and the massive use of precision weapons; and that new ways and means of resolving tasks will be unveiled to confront modern interstate and intrastate opposition.[footnoteRef:108] Stolyarov noted that the operational art department is concentrating its efforts on developing new, unconventional forms and methods of employing large strategic formations and groupings of forces in both large-scale and local wars, as well as in armed conflicts.[footnoteRef:109] He noted that in the very near future, substantial changes will occur in the theory and practice of operational art.[footnoteRef:110] Kopytko stated that operational art includes combined arms operational art (combined arms of large strategic formations); operational art of the services and the centrally controlled arms (Strategic Missile Troops, Airborne Troops, and Space Troops); and operational art of the operational rear services. The structure is not constant but develops in line with the evolution of both weaponry and new combat arms and forces.[footnoteRef:111] [105: Korotchenko, p. 15.] [106: Ibid.] [107: Ibid.] [108: Zherebtsov.] [109: Stolyarov.] [110: Ibid.] [111: Kopytko.] The last section of the article, on the use of operational art in space, noted that being in a superior position during the initial period of war is the primary element that clears the way for the use of operational art in space and helps ensure success. Putting the proper equipment in space during peacetime prepares Russias military for the initial period of war. Large-strategic formations would be composed of equipment that includes lasers, satellites, anti-satellite missiles, counter communication, and other pieces of equipment instead of tanks, artillery, and aviation units. Numerous similarities in the characteristics surrounding the use of operational art in ground operations (weaknesses on flanks, etc.) are present in space, which provide further rational for Russia conceptualizing the use of operational art or even perhaps OMGs in that domain. \\nToday, equipment orbits above us and cables wrap the globe together under the seas. Space objects, suspended in orbit, are equipped with capabilities that offer the opportunity to form OMGs in space in a suspended status, awaiting further orders for their activation or integration much like a computer virus. As was noted above by one Russian author, modern methods of aerospace and air defense practices contain forces that must (not maybe, but must) use the theory and practice of operational art and its methods and techniques.[footnoteRef:112] [112: A. P. Korabelnikov, Modern Methods of Aerospace and Air Defense of Facilities and Prospective Development Trends, Military Thought (in English), Volume 1 2019.] A recent US report suggested how the nation might incentivize Russia to fall in line with an international space traffic management (STM) scheme. These recommendations were:\\nEstablish red lines in space surrounding critical satellites to quickly and clearly assign liability, when an undesirable space conjunction occurs. \\nWith the best data and skills, DoD should take the initiative to develop specific space traffic standards and best practices pertaining to military security in STM. Otherwise, economic agencies and commercial operators could favor economic prosperity over military security. \\nThe United States should submit an amendment to the Liability Convention to change the current fault-based liability for damage in space by a space object to absolute liability,",
