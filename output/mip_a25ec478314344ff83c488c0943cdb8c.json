  "text": "environment. This made the between-pair separation task more difficult than what \\ncontrollers were used to, as several noted in open-ended comments. Across ten Nominal \\nscenario occurrences involving between-pair separation assessments, nine involved the \\nCombined Monitor configuration. However, the occurrence of the violation in these cases is \\nlikely more of an artifact of the slight timing variations between the scenarios and cannot be \\nconclusively attributed to monitor configuration. As described in Section 5.4.4, controllers were asked after each Day 1-2 Nominal scenario if IM \\nPA operations can be effectively monitored by the number of positions they just experienced. \\nAll Week 2-3 TRACON controllers agreed for both configurations, though overall response \\nvariability was slightly greater for the Combined Monitor configuration. In the same \\nquestionnaire, and as described in the same section, controllers were asked directly if given the \\nappropriate training and IM PA-related tools, a single (Combined) Monitor controller can \\neffectively ensure separation across both approaches during IM PA operations. The majority \\n(90%) of TRACON controllers agreed. At the end of Day 3, after experiencing all scenarios including Lateral Deviations, controllers \\nwere asked if they would expect to be able to effectively monitor any number of IM PA pairs, \\nup to and including all aircraft pairs performing IM PA (100%). Though majorities of TRACON \\ncontrollers agreed for both monitor configurations, higher response variability was observed for \\nthe Combined Monitor. To determine if there was a statistically significant difference between \\ncontroller responses for each configuration, a paired-sample T-Test analysis was run on the \\nTRACON controller agreement ratings for this question. The descriptive statistics (n, M, and SD) \\nare shown in Table 5-27. The probability of finding an effect when there was none, alpha (), \\nwas set to 0.05. The results of the two-tailed T-Test analysis resulted in a statistically significant \\np = 0.049. This suggests a significant difference in controller agreement with respect to the \\nstrength of agreement between the two configurations, with controllers appearing to expect to \\nbe able to more effectively monitor any number of IM PA pairs in a Separate Monitor \\nconfiguration. cxvi\\n Conclusion: This hypothesis is partially supported by the simulation results. First, despite some \\nworkload concerns raised in the comments regarding a Combined Monitors ability to intervene \\nwith two aircraft that deviate nearly simultaneously, controller responses did not suggest an \\nappreciable difference in workload rating and acceptability between the two monitor \\nconfigurations under nominal conditions. Second, numerous questions were related to the \\neffectiveness and acceptability of a Combined Monitor controller ensuring separation across \\nboth approaches during IM PA operations. Across these questions, the TRACON controllers \\nalmost always agreed the Combined Monitor position was effective and acceptable. When \\ncompared to responses to the Separate Monitor configuration, however, the response \\nvariability tended to be higher. When analyzing separation violations between and within IM PA \\npairs, no differences could be concluded with respect to monitor configuration. In addition, \\nafter the Lateral Deviation scenarios, controllers more strongly agreed they would expect to be \\nable to effectively monitor any number of IM PA pairs, up to and including all aircraft pairs \\nperforming IM PA (100%), when working in a Separate Monitor configuration. H7(RQ6): Final controllers will find the IM PA initiation task, including the use 6.8.7\\nof the Partial IM Clearance, acceptable. This hypothesis was first measured via responses to questions pertaining to 28R Final controller \\nworkload. As described in Section 5.3.1, the TRACON controllers reported low workload for all \\nthree Monitor controller positions. The majority (90%) of TRACON controllers then described \\ntheir workload as acceptable, and in the comments some indicated that more tasks could have \\nbeen handled. --------------------------------- The second part of this hypothesis was measured via responses to questions regarding the IM \\ninitiation task. As described in Section 5.2.5.2, the majority (90%) agreed the tasks required of \\nthe 28R Final controller position were acceptable. Also, as described in Section 5.3.2, the \\nmajority (80%) of TRACON controllers on average agreed given the appropriate training, and IM \\nPA-related tools, Final controllers can acceptably initiate the IM PA operation, though \\nresponses were variable. The majority (90%) of TRACON controllers also agreed, that on \\naverage, that they had the necessary display elements to provide the appropriate IM \\nClearance information to the trail aircraft in an IM PA pair. No practical difference between the \\ntwo IM PA Tool configurations were observed for these questions. However, many controllers \\nindicated in open-ended comments to several questions, including those in Section 5.3.6, that \\nproviding preview CSL and WSL lines before the IM Clearance needs to be sent would improve \\nthe IM initiation task. The acceptability of the Partial IM Clearance procedure was measured via responses to two \\nquestions regarding the acceptability of the communications, as described in Section 5.3.3. First, \\nall (100%) TRACON controllers agreed it is operationally acceptable for the Final controller to \\nprovide the IM PA spacing goal, though some had suggestions regarding the specific \\nphraseology used. Second, controller responses were variable, but a majority (70%) agreed the \\nIM PA spacing goal communication was acceptable. The controllers that disagreed provided \\ncomments that suggested their disagreement had more to do with the phraseology and number cxvii\\n of override transmissions than providing the Assigned Spacing Goal. Controller concerns regarding the IM PA initiation task had more to do with the available time \\nand airspace to perform the task, as simulated in the HITL, versus the particular steps required \\nto initiate IM PA. As described in Section 5.3.2, responses were variable to the question of once \\nthe IM Trail Aircraft joined the final, I had sufficient time and airspace to initiate IM PA before \\ntransferring the aircraft to the Local controller, though a majority (70%) agreed. This response \\nvariability also extended to the questions of: given the appropriate training, and the IM PA-\\nrelated tools I had available in this scenario, Final controllers can acceptably ensure \\nseparation during IM PA operations before transferring aircraft to the Local controller. And, I \\nwas comfortable that I was transferring appropriately separated aircraft to the Local \\ncontroller. Though majorities of controllers agreed to both questions, several concerns and \\nsuggestions were raised here, and in the open-ended comments in Section 5.3.6, regarding the \\ninitiation task integration into the scenario airspace. Conclusion: This hypothesis is supported by the simulation results. Overall, controllers found the \\nIM PA initiation task, including the use of the Partial IM Clearance, acceptable. However, \\nconcerns were raised regarding the phraseology, available CSL and WSL information at the time \\nof initiation, and the available time and airspace to perform the task as simulated. Results Summary6.9\\nThis section lists and summarizes the overall findings from the HITL subjective questionnaire \\ndata and objective analyses. It does not include inputs from the post-simulation debriefs held at \\nthe end of Day 3. These are included as appropriate in the Section 6 discussion. Overall Acceptability and Performance6.9.1\\nOn average, all or a majority of TRACON controller participants agreed: IM PA is operationally desirable. (Section 5.2.1)\\nIM PA is compatible with terminal approach operations. (Section 5.2.1)\\nA Final Monitor controller is the most appropriate position to monitor IM PA operations, \\nthough this may depend on facility. (Section 5.2.1)\\nThey were comfortable monitoring IM PA operations when both a CSL and WSL were \\nactive at the same time. (Section 5.2.2 and Section 5.8.1)\\nThey were comfortable allowing an IM Trail Aircraft to manage its own speed to achieve \\nthe desired spacing goal at the FAF. (Section 5.2.3)\\nTheir overall level of traffic awareness was acceptable with respect to all aircraft types \\n(IM Lead, IM Trail, and Other Aircraft). (Section 5.2.4)\\nThey were confident they could assess whether the separation between the IM Trail \\nAircraft and Lead Aircraft would be maintained. (Section 5.2.5) cxviii\\n The tasks required of each simulation position (Monitor and Final) were acceptable. \\n(Section 5.2.5.2) An analysis of separation violations in Section 5.2.5.2 found:\\nOnly a single occurrence within the IM PA pairings, which happened when a controller \\nappeared to try to manually assign a speed to keep an IM Trail Aircraft behind the CSL \\nand that was ultimately not effective.\\nEvery observed instance of a safety limit crossing, whether or not it resulted in an IM PA \\nseparation violation, occurred with the shortest alert timing values (25/15 sec).\\nFive cases were observed in which an IM Trail Aircraft crossed a safety limit; however, a \\ncontroller PTT click was observed between the time of the Caution Alert and the time of \\nexceedance. Average controller PTT response before each exceedance was 10.8 seconds \\n(SD = 3.6).\\nTwelve total separation violations were observed between IM PA pairs across 42 total \\nruns. Ten of the 12 involved aircraft arriving to different runways, and nine of the 12 \\ninvolved a Category B aircraft in the lead. In at least half of the occurrences, an IM PA \\nPredictive or Caution Alert was active on the display at the time of the separation \\nviolation, which may have served as either a distraction or was determined to be a \\nhigher priority. The separation violation occurrences did not appear to be significantly \\ninfluenced by the IM PA Tools or monitor configuration independent variable \\nmanipulations. 28R Final Position6.9.2 IM PA",
