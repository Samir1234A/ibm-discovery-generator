  "text": "of non-dominated solutions after removing the global Pareto front has non-dominance rank of 2, and so on. The algorithm then sorts solutions within each non-dominance rank based on their crowding distance, or the average Euclidian distance from each solution to its nearest neighbors with the same non-dominance rank. Solutions farther from their nearest neighbors are more desirable for selection in order to promote more uniformly spaced fronts. The set of non-dominated solutions consists of Advisory Sets that provide the best trade-offs between the multiple metrics considered. The MOGA populates the Pareto front with solutions from every generation, if qualified. Therefore, the result may contain more solutions than the population of a single generation. Generating Advisory SetsIV. The Pareto Set identified by the MOGA is likely to contain many more solutions than can be evaluated and therefore clustering approaches are typically used to identify a smaller number of distinct solutions [17, 18, 19]. However, for large-dimensional trade-spaces, direct evaluation is likely to obscure the key trade-offs sought. As such, this paper proposes to use PCA to identify correlations within the trade-space, reducing the dimensionality of the problem. Spectral clustering is performed on the reduced dataset and representative solutions that characterize critical trade-offs that persist can be readily identified for further evaluation. Principal Components AnalysisA.\\nPCA is a mathematical approach for identifying the rotation matrix of the axes such that the primary axis (first Principal Component, PC1) captures the maximum variation within the Pareto Set. Each subsequent axis is orthogonal and aligns with the next highest direction of variation. Each solution in the Pareto Set corresponds to a point in the objective space, defined by its value for each metric, and therefore, solutions can be expressed as linear combinations of metric values. The correlation matrix, which characterizes the relative co-variation between these metrics, can be readily computed. Using matrix algebra, the correlation matrix is then transformed into its diagonal components, or eigenvalues. The corresponding eigenvectors provide new directions for the coordinate axes. The directions are ordered by the magnitude of the eigenvalues, where the largest eigenvalue defines the first principal component. The number of principal components is the same as the original dimension (10, in this case). However, as the variation captured by later components is often quite small, these dimensions can be ignored with little loss in representation. As a general rule, only components with corresponding eigenvalues greater than one are needed to adequately represent the trade-space. Clustering the Pareto SetB.\\nClustering can now be done using the remaining principal components. Specifically, a modified spectral clustering algorithm [20] iteratively partitions a group of solutions into two until the stopping criteria are reached. This algorithm does not require that the number of desired groups be determined a priori. Rather, it employs scale factors for the number of nearest neighbors considered to define the mean and variance of a given cluster, which can be tuned to produce a reasonable number of clusters. Selecting Representative SolutionsC.\\nWithin each cluster, a single Advisory Set is selected to represent that corresponding portion of the trade-space. As such, it is desirable that the Advisory Set contains the reroutes most common among these solutions. To evaluate the relative importance of each flights reroute to the cluster, we calculate the central design for each cluster using the approach developed in [21]. The central design of a cluster is defined by the most common reroutes selected for each flight. Specifically, if we consider to be the set of design vectors in cluster , then we can compute the probability mass function for the values of each design attribute , denoted as . Using the probability mass function, we can then define the most common value for each design attribute as well as its frequency of occurrence for the specified attribute across the cluster of design vectors. (3) (4) As the design vector may not correspond to an existing Pareto Set solution, we seek the closest Pareto solution to this vector. The distance between a Pareto solution and the central design measures whether two attributes have the same value. As such, the most prominent attributes of the cluster (in our example, reroute candidates) will be part of the representative solution. To compute categorical distance, we use the weighted Jaccard distance [22], where the weights are defined by the frequency of the most common value. If each solution in is described by a design vector, , consisting of design attributes, the Jaccard distance, is defined as shown in Equation 5. (5) Here, represents the logical and, and represents the logical or. The representative solution for the cluster corresponds to the design with the lowest Jaccard distance to the central design. Results and AnalysisV.\\nA historical example used to evaluate the proposed approach involves nine flights requiring reroutes around convective weather, as illustrated in the snapshot shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 Snapshot of Convective Weather Blocking Routes for Nine Flights on 20 April 2009 at 20:30 Using DSP-M, reroute candidates were generated for each of the nine flights, showing the reliability of the \\napproach. Table 2 lists the origin and destination of each flight and the number of candidates generated. The final \\ncolumn in Table 2 lists the color used to display each flights reroute in the figures at the end of this section. Viewing Table 2 we note that the number of candidates varies by flight, which has implications for the diversity in Pareto Set solutions. However, this candidate pool still results in 1.8 x 10^17 possible Advisory Sets. Due to the size of the design space and to ensure that the 10-D trade-space is adequately populated, the MOGA returns 5000 Pareto-optimal solutions. Application of Principal Components AnalysisA.\\nThe Principal Components of the Pareto Set are shown in Fig. 5. Figure 5a (left) displays, in descending order, the ten eigenvalues of the correlation matrix which indicates the variation captured in each corresponding direction. The line to the right of the bars indicates the cumulative variation captured by each subsequent principal component, Table 2 Flight Origin, Destination, Number of Options and Reroute Color Flight Origin Destination # Color A Westchester County (HPN) Raleigh Durham International (RDU) 64 White B LaGuardia (LGA) Raleigh Durham International (RDU) 62 Green C Reagan National (DCA) Charleston International (CHS) 17 Dark Blue D Norfolk International (ORF)\\nOrlando International (MCO) 84 Red E Raleigh Durham International (RDU) Reagan National (DCA) 90 Aqua Blue F Charlotte Douglas International (CLT) LaGuardia (LGA) 275 Yellow G Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International (ATL) LaGuardia (LGA) 272 Green H Baltimore Washington International (BWI)\\nNorfolk International (ORF) 15 Light Yellow I Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International (ATL) LaGuardia (LGA) 322 Dark Yellow Fig. 5 Principal Components: left (a) displays eigenvalues and cumulative variation, and right (b) \\ndisplays eigenvectors of the first two principal directions revealing that over 80% of the variation is captured by the first two components. As subsequent components have \\neigenvalues less than one, the remainder of this analysis focuses on these first two principal components, referred to \\nas PC1 and PC2, respectively. Fig. 5b (right) lists the correlation of each original metric to these first two directions. PC1, which accounts for 64% of the variation in the Pareto Set, has a strong correlation with all but 2 metrics of operational acceptability. These metrics, Route Blockage and Schedule Disruption, are instead correlated with the second direction, PC2, which accounts for an additional 18% of the variation. To understand these correlations intuitively, we refer to the metric categories described in Section II. The first category, design acceptability, is defined by two metrics, distance and flow conformance, where low values of each indicate higher acceptability. The correlation between these metrics and PC1 is 96% and 71%, respectively, implying that solutions with low PC1 values have higher design acceptability. Similarly, the metrics defining management acceptability, namely coordination, return to route and number of segments have correlations of 79%, 98% and 91%, respectively, with PC1. Again, as low values in the original metrics indicate better management acceptability, solutions with low values of PC1 will exhibit better management acceptability. The flights in flow metric is also highly correlated with PC1; however, the positive correlation here is misleading. Recall from Section II.0, that the flights in flow metric computes the number of consecutive common segments between reroutes in the Advisory Set. As such, Advisory Sets with high values in PC1 will have more reroutes organized into flows. This relationship indicates the first critical trade-off for this example. The final two metrics with high correlations to PC1 are sector congestion (81%) and blockage probability (91%). Recall that PCA characterizes the variations exhibited by solutions in the Pareto Set, which is problem-specific. In this example, little variation in blockage probability is exhibited by any of the candidates listed in Table 2 and the small variations that exist are due to differences in the underlying reroutes in the Advisory Set, and thus can be correlated with the other metrics, for example distance. For sector congestion, the lack of variation is due to the selection of reroutes included in the Pareto",
