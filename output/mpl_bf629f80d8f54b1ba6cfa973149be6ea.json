Spatial/Spectral Methods Fan and Messinger [25] describe a graph-based hyperspectral image classification technique based on a split/merge paradigm using normalized cuts with a locally adaptive spatial/spectral graph. The spatial/spectral similarity graph is based on a Shi and Malik [26] construction composed of the product of feature similarity and spatial proximity terms. Fan and Messingers adaptation replaces the feature space term (left) with a ZMP variant using locally adaptive scaling as shown in (4). \\n3 NICDM is not a distance metric as it only satisfies positivity and symmetry axioms, but not the triangle inequality, see [37]. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n= 2 2\\n2 exp\\n),( exp\\nd ji jiij ji ij vv c vvd\\nw \\n (4) The left hand side of (4) represents a Gaussian weighted locally-scaled spectral Euclidean distance, i.e., a spectral diffusion function similar to that in the ZMP method. The local scaling parameters, a and b, are defined in [27] as the \\ndistance to the kth nearest neighbor; however in this treatment the number of nearest neighbors, 8, is determined by the \\nadaptive nearest neighbor method (Section II-D). The additional scaling term in the denominator of (4), R, is \\nan integer indicating the number of common neighbors between nodes i and j. This offers some protection from joining disparate regions by increasing the weight between nodes in the same cluster. Fig, 3 shows two cases where the weight between AC is increased compared to that of AB despite being the same distance away because A and C have common neighbors. In Fig 3a, the shared neighbor adjustment drives down the weight for edge AB despite pixel A and B having the same density. Whereas in Fig 3b, the weight is reduced more due to the smaller relative density of pixel B to pixel A (bc <\\nbe. The right hand side of (4) is a spatial diffusion (dampening) adjustment that performs two tasks: 1) it promotes connections between spatially proximal pixels (small ), \\nenforcing spatial coherence present in imagery and 2) inhibits growth of larger disjoint scene-wide clusters despite any apparent spectral similarity. As such, the graph becomes overly segmented and must undergo a merging step to generate a classification map. The spatial dampening constant, b, limits the size of \\nspatially contiguous regions and is the only user-defined parameter. Gillis and Bowles [29] encode both spatial and spectral information into weights associated with only spatial neighbors. Constructing the graph in this way reduces the number of edges and facilitates faster solutions due to sparser matrix operations. The weights are defined by spectrally- modified spatial diffusion kernel given by (5) for all pixels \\nFig. 3. Weight adjustment based on common nearest neighbors [modified from 25]. Intuitively nodes A and C are more similar than nodes A and B due to community structure. This aspect is reinforced via use of shared nearest neighbors in determining the edge weights.

The weighting has a similar general form to that described in Fan and Messinger, but the weights are only encoded for those pixels within the r x r spatial neighborhood. A spatial/spectral approach called locally weighted nearest neighbors is described by Mercovich in [13]. In this method, pixels are connected to their 8 = i + k nearest neighbors, \\nwhere g represents the number of global neighbors determined by the k-NN algorithm (any of the k-NN methods previously described would suffice) and l represents the number of local neighbors confined to a window centered on the pixel. The spectral angle between the test pixel and all pixels within a user-defined local spatial neighborhood is computed and the l pixels with the smallest spectral angle are also connected to the test pixel. Fig. 4 provides a synthetic example indicating the local and global pixels with red triangles and green dots at the pixel center respectively. A pixels local neighborhood is indicated by a dotted black box centered on the pixel of interested. The best global neighbors may also be the best local neighbors, so each pixel is not guaranteed to have an out degree of k. This graph is also directed and must be made symmetric by one of the two methods previously discussed in Section II-B. Mercovich describes method performance with five local and 25 global neighbors. Increasing local connectivity in this manner facilitates segmentation, clustering, and classification if regions demonstrate spatial coherence. Additionally, using spectral angle within a local region may help connect pixels composed of similar materials but with varying illumination (in and out of shadow). III. NEW METHODS FOR HSI GRAPH CONSTRUCTION In this section, we describe several new spectral-density based graph construction techniques stemming from algorithms in the data mining literature. Any of the spatial weighting techniques discussed in Section II-F may also be applied along with the technique to generate spatial/spectral variants. A. Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) Graphs The SNN similarity introduced by Jarvis and Patrick [30] is based on the premise that similar nodes should have overlapping neighborhoods. Hence the similarity of two nodes, as measured by some primary similarity measure, is reinforced, or confirmed, by the presence of common (shared) neighbors. SNN is a nonlinear technique that can be very effective in the presence of clusters not well modeled by symmetric parametric distributions due to its ability to find regions of varying shape and density [30], and is widely used in the data mining community [31]. The strength of the similarity between two nodes may therefore be recast in terms of the number of shared neighbors, i.e., the higher the number of shared neighbors, the more similar the nodes. Given a vertex set V consisting of G =\\n|| vertices and a neighborhood size k, where 8 m, let the k \\nneighborhood set of vertex i be represented as 9 , \\nand define the SNN similarity as the size of the neighborhood intersection between two nodes i and j (6). )()(),( jNNiNNjiSNN kk I= (6) Whereas the initial implementation of SNN used fixed neighborhood sets (constant k), we recognize asymmetric neighborhoods as simply a generalization resulting from the use of adaptive density-based methods. We therefore define the more general density-based adaptive SNN measure as ,)()(),( jNNiNNjiSNN kjki I= (7) where ki and kj are the size of the neighborhoods generated for vertices i and j respectively from any of the density-based node-connectivity techniques from Section II. A SNN cosine similarity [32] may also be defined and is given by ,\\n),( ),cos(\\nkjki jiSNN kjki IVIV\\njiSNN ji \\n= \\n= (8) where IVv is the edge indicator vector for node v and ki, kj, and o , are as defined in (6) and (7). \\nFrom an imaging spectroscopy perspective, whereas symmetric globular clusters may exist in isolated regions of uniform material type, the presence of significant mixing can result in asymmetrically extended non-globular regions in hyperspace rendering description by parametric forms difficult; hence the need to explore methods invariant to cluster shape. The concept of overlapping neighborhood counts was first \\nFig. 4. Locally weighted nearest neighbors connects a pixel with seven global and two local neighbors [13]. This construct reinforces the spatial coherence found in imagery while permitting global connection to the most similar pixels.

Case Number 16-3868 \\n 8 used in HSI graph construction by Fan and Messinger [25] to modify the strength of a Gaussian-diffusion spectral similarity measure derived from Euclidean distance (Section II-F). This treatment differs in that the spectral similarity is based entirely on SNN counts and variations thereof. Creation of the SNN graph is conceptually simple, but more computationally expensive than the methods discussed thus far due to intersection of nearest neighbor sets for counting shared neighbors. The SNN similarity is therefore a secondary metric generated from a primary distance (or similarity) metric. The steps required to generate a SNN graph based on the SNN similarity are given below. 1) Compute the pairwise (dis)similarity matrix A primary distance (similarity) measure is used to define initial edges. 2) Construct a mutual k-NN graph Mutuality is imposed to avoid edges crossing regions of differing density (cf. Section II-B) and decrease computation time through a reduction in the number of required set intersections. 3) Redefine edge weights with the SNN (secondary) metric \\nThe number of neighbors shared by the two nodes becomes the new edge weight, replacing the (dis)similarity score from the primary metric.

  "text": "variable\\nas to how well the CDTI traffic display could be integrated into their normal instrument scan.\\nHowever, the majority agreed that their overall scan time was acceptable and generally agreed\\nthat the required head down time was acceptable. Related to this, pilots reported wanting the 5-7 IM information integrated into the PFD and navigation display, versus into new displays such as\\nan auxiliary traffic display. The min IM speed change advisory was reported as useful and a minimum requirement for IM\\nby the pilots. The majority of pilots also reported that placing a box around new IM speeds was\\nsufficient for detecting the presence of a new speed. Pilots did not report a need for an aural\\nalert for each new IM speed. Data did show that when pilots had not complied with IM speeds\\nthey had been presented for a shorter period of time (around 8 seconds) than those that were\\ncomplied with. That could be due to pilots missing the IM speed (which was noted by the\\nobserver in some cases) or pilots not having time to implement the IM speed before another\\none was displayed. Either way, it seems that it was reasonable operationally to miss the speed\\nas another one was about to be presented. All pilots agreed that the IM speed conformance\\nmonitoring alert was useful and the majority agreed that it is a minimum requirement. This\\nalert has an aural associated with it and seemed to be sufficient for an aural alert related to IM\\nspeeds. Since the IM speed conformance alerting was, unintentionally, implemented differently than\\nspecified in DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a), it is interesting to determine whether the behavior seen in\\nthe simulation helps validate the requirements. Approximately 58% of the advisories provided\\nin the simulation were per the standard. The other 42% were not and were inside the tolerance\\nthreshold specified in the standard. The number of advisories seen in the simulation were not\\nreported to be problematic and may have actually helped more with conformance than if the\\nalerting was implemented per the standard. The use of this result is a bit unclear due to the\\npotential interaction between the additional alerts and the speed conformance. The display implementation purposefully did not make a distinction for the pilots about\\nwhether they were in the achieve or maintain stage of the achieve-by then maintain clearance\\ntype. The distinction was not believed to something that the flight crew needed to act on, so\\nthe information was not provided. This approach did not reveal any issues with pilot awareness\\nof IM operations, which suggests this should not be a minimum requirement. A majority of pilots reported a willingness to perform IM with both the min and min+ tool sets\\nand that both included the necessary information. The majority also agreed that they were able\\nto detect spacing issues with both tool sets. Additionally, two statistical tests run on the use of\\nthe two tool sets did not reveal any statistically significant findings. This indicates that the min\\ntool set may be sufficient as a minimum implementation. However, caution should be exercised\\nwith these results as past work and some data from this simulation indicate that at least the\\ngraphical progress indicator should be considered for a useful minimum requirement. This\\nresult and caution is similar to that reported in Swieringa et al. (2014) where a simulation\\nsimilar to that reported here was conducted. The following paragraphs will review the two min+\\nfeatures (i.e., the graphical progress indicator and speed tape). The graphical progress indicator was reported as useful by the majority of pilots, but opinions\\nwere mixed as to whether it is a minimum requirement. However, much of the past work on IM\\nhas either required this feature or has worked to perfect it. EUROCONTROL requires a graphical\\nspacing cue (Hoffman et al., 2006), NASA Ames used one (NASA, 2004), and NASA Langley has\\nbeen working to perfect one (e.g., Swieringa et al., 2014). MITRE recommended one but did not 5-8 have one developed based on supporting a specific implementation (Bone et al., 2003). Pilots\\nhave also indicated a strong preference for such a feature (e.g., Baxley et al., 2013).\\nAdditionally, the feasibility check as implemented in this simulation was based on DO-361\\n(RTCA, 2015a) defined bounds that were found to be in error (based on the use in this\\nsimulation). As a result, the bounds used in this simulation flagged infeasible operations more\\nthan was intended by the authors of DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a). Additionally, operations that were\\nshown as infeasible would become feasible again before the flight crew acted. Pilots appeared\\nto have difficulty determining whether an operation was going to remain infeasible and what\\naction to take. These issues could have led to questioning whether the graphical progress\\nindicator should be a minimum. Pilot comments in various questions indicate that it is\\nimportant to clarify tolerances and the associated actions. Pilot opinions were variable on whether the speed tape on the CDTI traffic display was useful\\nand a minimum requirement. Pilot opinion of the speed tape was likely driven by the placement\\nof the feature on the CDTI traffic display, which was not where the pilots were expected to, or\\ndid, focus. Moving this feature to the AGD or PFD could impact this result and make the feature\\nmore desirable, as it contains key details such as the IM speed, whether the IM speed is set in\\nthe MCP, and whether the aircraft is flying the IM speed. Such information has been displayed\\nor required in past research (e.g., Hoffman et al., 2006; Bone and Long, 2014; Latorella, 2015). Overall, the min+ tool set received more yes replies (compared to the min) when pilots\\nreported whether the display included all the necessary information. Additionally, higher /\\nmore positive ratings were provided (compared to the min) when pilots reported the ability to\\ndetect developing spacing issues. The ratings were also higher for the min+ tool set (compared\\nto the min) when pilots were asked whether the displays were acceptable during IM execution. The objective data also shows more positive trends for the min+ tool set. While the rate of IM\\nspeeds per minute and magnitude of IM speed for both tool sets were similar, pilots complied\\nwith approximately 6% more IM speeds and had less spacing error at the ABP for the min+ tool\\nset (though the trends should only be considered in light of other trends as neither were\\nstatistically significant). Pilots also received approximately 6% less IM speed conformance\\nadvisories for the min+ tool set. Few to no comments were received about the need for additional display features beyond the\\nmin or min+ tool sets. However, there were pilots replies from different questions asking for\\ntrend information on the graphical progress indicator, especially when near or at the tolerance\\nboundaries. 5.5 Communications\\nThe participant pilots did not receive capture then maintain clearances, but those clearances\\nare shorter and so the amount of information contained in them should also be acceptable. The\\ncapture then maintain clearance was reported as acceptable by controllers. The amount of\\ninformation in the achieve-by clearance type was reported as acceptable by participant pilots.\\nHowever, the achieve-by clearance type acceptability had variable controller responses. Just\\nless than half of the controllers reported wanting to keep the clearance concise, though efforts 5-9 had already been made in this simulation to keep the clearance concise (e.g., not stating the\\nPTP in the clearance). The pilots also reported that the necessary information was available from the clearance to\\ndetect and select the lead aircraft. The information provided was the lead aircraft identification\\n(e.g., American one twenty-three). Once the flight crew had the lead aircraft identification, they\\ncould either select the traffic by touching it on the display or they could enter the aircraft\\nidentification and it would be selected for them. The majority of the time they did the latter. Pilots and controllers reported the use of the lead aircraft identification in the IM clearance was\\nacceptable, though there was some variability in the pilot replies. The majority of both pilots\\nand controllers reported no issues when the lead aircraft identification was used. 5.6 IM Benefits\\nThe spacing error (the difference between the planned interval and the achieved interval) was\\nmeasured for all aircraft at the FAF / YOKXO. For IM aircraft, the planned interval became the\\nASG at the ABP and the spacing error is a direct measure of how close the IM aircraft were to\\nthe ASG. For non-IM aircraft, it is a measure of how well the aircraft met the planned interval.\\nBoth IM and non-IM aircraft had a small spacing error (under 1 second) but the IM aircraft had\\nhalf the variance (4.1 seconds less) of non-IM aircraft. These results are similar to past work\\nthat found IM reduces the inter-arrival spacing variation (e.g., Rognin et al., 2005; Prevot et al.,\\n2007). IM aircraft met the ASG with a 4.1 second SD. Therefore, IM aircraft met the\\nperformance goal of 5.0 seconds IAT SD mentioned in Section 2.2.2.1. Overall, IM and non-IM\\naircraft met the performance baseline / goals expected for the operations. Aircraft conducting IM spent approximately 1.5 minutes more on the RNAV path (less time\\nvectored) as compared to non-IM aircraft. This result is similar to that found by Thipphavong et\\nal. (2013) who also found IM aircraft (and their lead aircraft) remained on the RNAV routes\\nlonger than those not conducting IM. Keeping IM aircraft on their routes is an indication that\\ncontrollers were allowing those aircraft",
