  "text": "variable\\nas to how well the CDTI traffic display could be integrated into their normal instrument scan.\\nHowever, the majority agreed that their overall scan time was acceptable and generally agreed\\nthat the required head down time was acceptable. Related to this, pilots reported wanting the 5-7 IM information integrated into the PFD and navigation display, versus into new displays such as\\nan auxiliary traffic display. The min IM speed change advisory was reported as useful and a minimum requirement for IM\\nby the pilots. The majority of pilots also reported that placing a box around new IM speeds was\\nsufficient for detecting the presence of a new speed. Pilots did not report a need for an aural\\nalert for each new IM speed. Data did show that when pilots had not complied with IM speeds\\nthey had been presented for a shorter period of time (around 8 seconds) than those that were\\ncomplied with. That could be due to pilots missing the IM speed (which was noted by the\\nobserver in some cases) or pilots not having time to implement the IM speed before another\\none was displayed. Either way, it seems that it was reasonable operationally to miss the speed\\nas another one was about to be presented. All pilots agreed that the IM speed conformance\\nmonitoring alert was useful and the majority agreed that it is a minimum requirement. This\\nalert has an aural associated with it and seemed to be sufficient for an aural alert related to IM\\nspeeds. Since the IM speed conformance alerting was, unintentionally, implemented differently than\\nspecified in DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a), it is interesting to determine whether the behavior seen in\\nthe simulation helps validate the requirements. Approximately 58% of the advisories provided\\nin the simulation were per the standard. The other 42% were not and were inside the tolerance\\nthreshold specified in the standard. The number of advisories seen in the simulation were not\\nreported to be problematic and may have actually helped more with conformance than if the\\nalerting was implemented per the standard. The use of this result is a bit unclear due to the\\npotential interaction between the additional alerts and the speed conformance. The display implementation purposefully did not make a distinction for the pilots about\\nwhether they were in the achieve or maintain stage of the achieve-by then maintain clearance\\ntype. The distinction was not believed to something that the flight crew needed to act on, so\\nthe information was not provided. This approach did not reveal any issues with pilot awareness\\nof IM operations, which suggests this should not be a minimum requirement. A majority of pilots reported a willingness to perform IM with both the min and min+ tool sets\\nand that both included the necessary information. The majority also agreed that they were able\\nto detect spacing issues with both tool sets. Additionally, two statistical tests run on the use of\\nthe two tool sets did not reveal any statistically significant findings. This indicates that the min\\ntool set may be sufficient as a minimum implementation. However, caution should be exercised\\nwith these results as past work and some data from this simulation indicate that at least the\\ngraphical progress indicator should be considered for a useful minimum requirement. This\\nresult and caution is similar to that reported in Swieringa et al. (2014) where a simulation\\nsimilar to that reported here was conducted. The following paragraphs will review the two min+\\nfeatures (i.e., the graphical progress indicator and speed tape). The graphical progress indicator was reported as useful by the majority of pilots, but opinions\\nwere mixed as to whether it is a minimum requirement. However, much of the past work on IM\\nhas either required this feature or has worked to perfect it. EUROCONTROL requires a graphical\\nspacing cue (Hoffman et al., 2006), NASA Ames used one (NASA, 2004), and NASA Langley has\\nbeen working to perfect one (e.g., Swieringa et al., 2014). MITRE recommended one but did not 5-8 have one developed based on supporting a specific implementation (Bone et al., 2003). Pilots\\nhave also indicated a strong preference for such a feature (e.g., Baxley et al., 2013).\\nAdditionally, the feasibility check as implemented in this simulation was based on DO-361\\n(RTCA, 2015a) defined bounds that were found to be in error (based on the use in this\\nsimulation). As a result, the bounds used in this simulation flagged infeasible operations more\\nthan was intended by the authors of DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a). Additionally, operations that were\\nshown as infeasible would become feasible again before the flight crew acted. Pilots appeared\\nto have difficulty determining whether an operation was going to remain infeasible and what\\naction to take. These issues could have led to questioning whether the graphical progress\\nindicator should be a minimum. Pilot comments in various questions indicate that it is\\nimportant to clarify tolerances and the associated actions. Pilot opinions were variable on whether the speed tape on the CDTI traffic display was useful\\nand a minimum requirement. Pilot opinion of the speed tape was likely driven by the placement\\nof the feature on the CDTI traffic display, which was not where the pilots were expected to, or\\ndid, focus. Moving this feature to the AGD or PFD could impact this result and make the feature\\nmore desirable, as it contains key details such as the IM speed, whether the IM speed is set in\\nthe MCP, and whether the aircraft is flying the IM speed. Such information has been displayed\\nor required in past research (e.g., Hoffman et al., 2006; Bone and Long, 2014; Latorella, 2015). Overall, the min+ tool set received more yes replies (compared to the min) when pilots\\nreported whether the display included all the necessary information. Additionally, higher /\\nmore positive ratings were provided (compared to the min) when pilots reported the ability to\\ndetect developing spacing issues. The ratings were also higher for the min+ tool set (compared\\nto the min) when pilots were asked whether the displays were acceptable during IM execution. The objective data also shows more positive trends for the min+ tool set. While the rate of IM\\nspeeds per minute and magnitude of IM speed for both tool sets were similar, pilots complied\\nwith approximately 6% more IM speeds and had less spacing error at the ABP for the min+ tool\\nset (though the trends should only be considered in light of other trends as neither were\\nstatistically significant). Pilots also received approximately 6% less IM speed conformance\\nadvisories for the min+ tool set. Few to no comments were received about the need for additional display features beyond the\\nmin or min+ tool sets. However, there were pilots replies from different questions asking for\\ntrend information on the graphical progress indicator, especially when near or at the tolerance\\nboundaries. 5.5 Communications\\nThe participant pilots did not receive capture then maintain clearances, but those clearances\\nare shorter and so the amount of information contained in them should also be acceptable. The\\ncapture then maintain clearance was reported as acceptable by controllers. The amount of\\ninformation in the achieve-by clearance type was reported as acceptable by participant pilots.\\nHowever, the achieve-by clearance type acceptability had variable controller responses. Just\\nless than half of the controllers reported wanting to keep the clearance concise, though efforts 5-9 had already been made in this simulation to keep the clearance concise (e.g., not stating the\\nPTP in the clearance). The pilots also reported that the necessary information was available from the clearance to\\ndetect and select the lead aircraft. The information provided was the lead aircraft identification\\n(e.g., American one twenty-three). Once the flight crew had the lead aircraft identification, they\\ncould either select the traffic by touching it on the display or they could enter the aircraft\\nidentification and it would be selected for them. The majority of the time they did the latter. Pilots and controllers reported the use of the lead aircraft identification in the IM clearance was\\nacceptable, though there was some variability in the pilot replies. The majority of both pilots\\nand controllers reported no issues when the lead aircraft identification was used. 5.6 IM Benefits\\nThe spacing error (the difference between the planned interval and the achieved interval) was\\nmeasured for all aircraft at the FAF / YOKXO. For IM aircraft, the planned interval became the\\nASG at the ABP and the spacing error is a direct measure of how close the IM aircraft were to\\nthe ASG. For non-IM aircraft, it is a measure of how well the aircraft met the planned interval.\\nBoth IM and non-IM aircraft had a small spacing error (under 1 second) but the IM aircraft had\\nhalf the variance (4.1 seconds less) of non-IM aircraft. These results are similar to past work\\nthat found IM reduces the inter-arrival spacing variation (e.g., Rognin et al., 2005; Prevot et al.,\\n2007). IM aircraft met the ASG with a 4.1 second SD. Therefore, IM aircraft met the\\nperformance goal of 5.0 seconds IAT SD mentioned in Section 2.2.2.1. Overall, IM and non-IM\\naircraft met the performance baseline / goals expected for the operations. Aircraft conducting IM spent approximately 1.5 minutes more on the RNAV path (less time\\nvectored) as compared to non-IM aircraft. This result is similar to that found by Thipphavong et\\nal. (2013) who also found IM aircraft (and their lead aircraft) remained on the RNAV routes\\nlonger than those not conducting IM. Keeping IM aircraft on their routes is an indication that\\ncontrollers were allowing those aircraft",
