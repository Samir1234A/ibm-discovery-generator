synthesize it into a form that OMB can review, use to \\nconsider next steps, and engage stakeholders; and represent the voices \\nand perspectives of the participants This report is intended to provide our perspective on the key take-\\naways from the discussions of that day; identify the challenges and \\nopportunities that emerged from those discussions; and provide a set \\nof recommended practices and actions for the government to consider, \\naligned with the intent and vision of the workforce strategies in the PMA Report Symposium on the Federal Workforce for the 21st Century The Presidents Management \\nAgenda: mission, service, \\nstewardship In early 2018, the Presidents Management \\nCouncil and the Executive Office of the President \\nreleased the PMA to lay out a long-term vision for \\nmodernizing the Federal Government in key areas \\nthat will improve the ability of agencies to deliver \\nmission outcomes, provide excellent service, and \\neffectively steward taxpayer dollars on behalf of \\nthe American people. The direction presented in the PMA follows a \\nsystems-thinking approach, identifying a closely \\nrelated set of strategies and actions to address \\nthe challenges around these three central themes These challenges are not newaging \\ntechnology infrastructure, disconnected and \\ndifficult-to-access data, and a long-standing \\ncivil service model that does not reflect modern \\nrealities or adequately serve federal workers and \\ntheir organizations The goal of the PMA is to \\naddress these challenges in an integrated manner, \\nrecognizing the interrelationships among them As the PMA describes \\nthe challenges facing \\ngovernment and the \\nfederal workforce, \\nit presents a vision \\nfor addressing the \\ncritical transformation \\ndrivers: modernizing information technology, \\nmaking data accessible to improve delivery to the \\npublic while creating greater accountability for \\nresults, and aligning and repositioning the federal \\nworkforce to the changing nature of work and \\nrapidly evolving expectations from the public \\nThe PMA includes Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) \\ngoals that focus on specific, targeted changes \\nand associated actions aligned with each of these drivers For CAP Goal 3, Developing a Workforce \\nfor the 21st Century, this includes three subgoals: Actively Manage the Workforce through \\nimproved employee performance management \\nand engagement Develop Agile Operations that support \\nretraining and redeploying human capital \\nresources Acquire Top Talent using simple and strategic \\nhiring approaches and practices Advancing the vision in the PMA requires devel-\\nopment of strategies and actions that the govern-\\nment can take to simultaneously drive measurable \\nresults and enable greater employee satisfaction \\nTo that end, OMB recognizes the need to engage \\nothers outside the federal government to better \\nunderstand the practices they use to drive change, \\ntheir insights on the changing nature of work, and \\nhow their workforce",
