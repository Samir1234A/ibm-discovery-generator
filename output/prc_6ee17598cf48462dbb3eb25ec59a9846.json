Below the size of a Major AIS system by leveraging COTS SW. | 19 | 'Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' Summary / Conclusions Acquisition Documents can be converted to a Digital Acquisition Data Base. \\n Workflows allow automated routing and let the Navy collect metrics. About 800 data items now, including about 40% (limited) Free-text. Automation should allow faster creation and approval of programs, as long as this replaces the plans. Process is not just a direct translation of the current reports.\\n Duplicate data is deleted. Pilot process will help define what additional data is needed. Automation should allow better planning via wizard tools. Creates tools to continue execution management and oversight, enables predictive analytics. Authority will be needed to enable pilot projects to use DB instead of current plans. | 20 | 'Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' BACKUP | 21 | 'Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' Recent Socialization of DA Concepts NAVAIR: Current PMT tools provide some of the source data \\nneeded. Working on Turbo Acquisition to eliminate duplicate paragraph \\nsections between acquisition documents. Goal is to set up an instantiation \\nof this by 12/18. Views proposed Data Base tool as the next logical step and \\nwould consider collaborating on a pilot implementation. Would consider \\nleverage of MITRE data schema in current efforts. SPAWARSYSCOM Does not have a data base initiative in place yet. Has a \\ntool to build an RFP using template paragraphs, focused on acquisition of \\nservices. Would consider piloting the proposed data base. MARCOR SYSCOM Discussions still in progress. NAVSEA SYSCOM Originated concept under FASTlane. In process of \\ntesting schema on navy servers. One project considering pilot testing \\n(Deployable Family of Systems). Seeking other additional projects. Discussions suggested that SYSCOMS could collaborate on standard \\ncontract templates and provide common documents in areas of expertise \\nfor subsystems and services (not platforms) | 22 | 'Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' Digital Acquisition Implementation Options September 26, 2018 | 23 | 'Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' Low-Sized Implementation, 1 SYSCOM LOE: 1 MITRE Staff member, Existing Navy staff A few programs, pilot usage (e.g. FAST lane). Focus on near term tasks with current E-plans Clean up data base, test security, permissions, and widgets Usability testing Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' Mid-Sized Implementation, 1 SYSCOM Larger effort, more deliberate implementation Start with 1 PEO and 2 or 3 programs, allow others 3Q/4Q Open to a full SYSCOM by 4Q Implement several documents on several programs.

Public Release Case Number 18-2212' Large-Scale Implementation Option A larger 2 to 4 SYSCOM implementation is possible Still require pilot programs to test usability and help programs \\nthrough socialization issues Phased approach would start at 1 PEO per SYSCOM for 3 \\nmonths, grow usage in stages Expand to additional PEO each quarter (phased roll-out, not a \\nbig-bang). Allow more PEOs to adapt DA tools if they want to. Challenges: Give viewers a familiar look and feel to legacy documents, Integrate with other data systems (ERP), Develop useful data dashboards and presentations, Keep people in control of the data (not vs. versa), security Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' Implementation Notes: MITRE Staff: 1 to 3 STE team (Data Scientist, Programmer, HCI SME) Focus on Data Schema, Cross-SYSCOM Architecture, DoN level data usage. Conduct Usability Testing Ensure cross-SYSCOM cohesion and upward integration 4 SYSCOM Teams: 1 Data Scientist Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' Summary / Conclusions Low LOE - Funded, Will continue to work out implementation issues with a few documents. Mid-Sized LOE Allows more deliberate implementation and user socialization (a difficult problem). Larger LOE implementation: Would accelerate usage and productivity, enable faster savings in time and $. Would leverage all SYSCOM expertise to evolve faster solution. Still well below the size of a Major AIS system if commercial infrastructure is leveraged. | 28 | 'Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' Data Not Included in the E-TEMP About 51 Data Fields Mostly duplicate data. Same data linked to AP and AS data base. Gold Rule of Data Bases Only keep data once, in one place. Link to it. Some data was the same data, in a different format. | 29 | 'Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212' Additional TEMP Data Needed? Considering additions to support hypothetical questions, e.g.: What DT and OT events are happening in the next quarter? Which DT and OT events just happened? Did they go well? When do DT and OT events happen, and is there a pattern during the year? Are test ranges used evenly throughout the year? How long does it take, on average, to get a test report completed after a test? Is the number of test days used typically more or less than the number of test days planned? What is the cost of a test day at each of the ranges, and why are they different? | 30 | 'Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.

Public Release Case Number 18-2212' RTI and the Flipped Model: APs Historically each program had its own acquisition plan, providing details on the program, and a chapter or appendix for the procurement method. Rapid Technology Insertion (RTI) started in PEO LCS in 2014, Used flipped model, with an Acquisition Plan that detailed the process, and a thin appendix specific to the project. General AP with a 3-page appendix filled with project specific data (approved in 2 weeks). \",",
