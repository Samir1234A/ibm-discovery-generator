  "text": "pilots of aircraft that are RTA capable are issued the TBFM-\\nderived STA as an RTA clearance by controllers. For aircraft that are not RTA capable, \\ncontrollers use their DST capabilities (such as the speed advisories or DCT) to efficiently manage \\nflights to meet the TBFM system generated STAs. When the required flight adjustment (i.e., iv crossing time delay) is predicted to exceed what can be accomplished at the current Flight Level \\nwith speed alone, the en route controller will need to either use a manual vector (e.g., s-turn) or \\nissue an interim altitude clearance to a lower Flight Level and then revert to use of RTA when the \\nautomation determines it is feasible. Given that aircraft RTA equipage is not yet available as part \\nof the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) flight plan, several alternatives to \\ndetermine RTA equipage by the operational system can be implemented. These alternatives \\ninclude: using an aircraft equipage table to determine RTA capability or using an FAA specific \\nextension of the ICAO flight plan to allow operators to submit RTA equipage information until a \\nstandardized ICAO version will be available.\\nAlternatively, if Path Stretch advisories are available (expected to be deployed within the same \\ntimeframe as TBM-RTA) the controllers will be able to assign the automation-provided path \\nchange solution along with an RTA to achieve the flight-specific crossing time. The Path Stretch \\nadvisory provides a two-legged maneuver (i.e., path change) for the flight that takes the aircraft \\noff the current route to a specified point, expressed as a radial and nautical miles distance from an \\navailable adjacent navigation fix, and back toward the current route. If the controller decides to \\nissue a Path Stretch advisory, the controller would communicate the path change to the pilot first \\nfollowed by the RTA clearance; the pilot programs their FMS to input the path change and RTA \\ncommand, in this order. Pilot confirmation to the controller that the RTA clearance is achievable \\nis required; once that is confirmed, the controller would accept the advisory on the situation \\ndisplay which would update the MRP list for that flight.\\nIf at any point during the RTA operation, it appears that the targeted flight-specific crossing time \\nwill not be met, the controller can suspend the TBM-RTA operation and revert to traditional \\nstrategies to meet the STA, such as applying speed control, vectoring, and altitude assignments. \\nWhile the concept document describes how RTAs can be used in en route airspace both in the \\ncruise phase of flight as well as in descent, for this evaluation the TBM-RTA concept was \\nexplored only during level flight in cruise in an extended metering (XM) context as depicted in \\nFigure 2. v Figure 2. RTA with Path Stretch Advisories in Extended Metering Environment vi 1 Refers to simulations that provide instruction on only a part of the whole job or task. Part-Task Human in the Loop Simulation3\\nFollowing the development of the ConOps presented in Section 2, MITRE CAASD executed a \\npart-task1 human-in-the-loop (HITL) evaluation to assess the operational feasibility of the \\nconcept [5]. Simulation Environment3.1\\nThe simulation was conducted in the MITRE CAASD Aviation Integrated Demonstration and \\nExperimentation for Aeronautics (IDEA) Lab. The hardware used for the simulation is the same \\nhardware used by field controllers, including two 4K displays, keyboards, track ball, and push-to-\\ntalk audio. Additionally, the evaluation occurred in a data collection environment that provided a \\nsimilar general workstation layout and setup to that of sectors at an air traffic control facility. \\nThe software used to conduct the TBM-RTA Part Task Evaluation was a combination of actual \\n(operational) software and an emulation of capabilities that are typically used as part of an Air \\nRoute Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) facility. The simulation software architecture was \\ncomposed of the following distinct components: TBFM Applications: this consists of an operational version of the TBFM software \\nthat was integrated in the MITRE IDEA Lab. This version of TBFM software \\nprovides the ability to issue GIM-S Speed Advisories. TBFM Connector: MITRE software used to interface the IDEA Lab simulation assets \\nto the operational TBFM system. The interfaces provide TBFM with track data and \\nflight plans and also receives metering information from the TBFM system. En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) Emulator: Consists of the MITRE \\nJoint En Route Decision Support System (DSS) Infrastructure (JEDI) software that \\nwas built to provide an emulation of ERAM. The software includes prototyped Path \\nStretch functionality that has not yet been operationally developed or fielded. Controller Stations: This consists of the controller Display System Interface (DSI) \\nemulation which is part of the ERAM software but is available as a modular \\ncomponent in the IDEA Lab. Flight Modeler: Consists of MITRE software capability used to realistically represent \\nthe characteristics of much of the current airplane fleet. Pseudo Pilots: Consists of an IDEA Lab software capability that can be used to \\ncontrol simulation traffic. The software is designed such that a single pilot can control \\nmultiple aircraft in a simulation. High-Fidelity FMS Flight Simulators3.2\\nIn addition to aircraft simulated using the IDEA Lab flight model, aircraft simulators that utilize \\nactual FMS control logic were also used in the simulation. The FMS simulators were introduced \\nbecause they more closely represent behavior of commercial aircraft avionics, which was \\nconsidered critical for evaluating the feasibility of TBM-RTA. In each of the four runs, two pilots \\nflew two simulators. Figure 3 provides a snapshot of the FMS workstation interface used. As vii indicated, the software interface is complex because it incorporates a full FMS interface. \\nConsequently, these simulators had to be staffed by dedicated Airline Transport Pilot License \\n(ATPL) certified pilots, unlike the IDEA Lab simulated aircraft where one pseudo-pilot managed \\nmultiple aircraft at once. Figure 3. High Fidelity FMS Simulation Core TBM-RTA Software Functions3.3\\nAside from the core software components described in Section 3.1, additional software \\nmodifications were implemented on the ATC automation to support the TBM-RTA concept \\nevaluation. A summary of the core software functions implemented is described here. \\nOne core function consists of the RTA assignment and tracking functions, which provides \\ncontrollers the means to monitor RTA assignments as aircraft progress through the sector and are \\nhanded off to subsequent sectors. Figure 4 shows an example for an aircraft that has been issued \\nan RTA clearance. As indicated, the MRP List is updated with the RTA assignment. \\nAdditionally, the data block is updated to indicate the assigned RTA. viii Figure 4. RTA Assignment and Tracking Another software change was made to clearly show to the controller which flights are and are not \\nRTA-equipped. The STA on the MRP list is bold and underlined for flights that are RTA \\nequipped, as shown by SWA474 in Figure 5. Non-equipped flights have gray STAs, such as \\nAAL433. Once a flight is assigned an RTA or speed clearance, the RTA or speed is listed in the \\nSpeed (SPD) column (the right-most column). This is a critical feature as not all aircraft will be \\ncapable of performing an RTA. Figure 5. RTA-equipped Flights on MRP List Operational Scenario3.4\\nThe concept was evaluated in a two-sector, en route environment representing the northeast \\ncornerpost flow into Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (KPHX) in the Albuquerque \\nARTCC, abbreviated ZAB. The two sectors simulated were ZAB 93, which primarily handles \\nflights in their cruise phase, and ZAB 39, which handles the descent phase of the arrival prior to \\nentering the TRACON. The focus of the evaluation was the metering operations in ZAB 93 \\n(highlighted in dark blue) to the extended metering point (XMP) identified as SLIDR \\n(pronounced slider). SLIDR is located at the en route merge near the airspace sector boundary \\nof ZAB 93 and ZAB 39 on the EAGUL6 Arrival Procedure (solid black line), as depicted in \\nFigure 6. ix Figure 6. ZAB Airspace Simulated During the HITL SLIDR is also a coupled meter point (CMP) in relation to the meter fix (MF), identified as \\nHOMRR (pronounced homer). That means the sequence of flights crossing SLIDR is held \\nconstant (or coupled) with the sequence of those same flights across HOMRR. In the current \\noperation, HOMRR is where the en route traffic is delivered to the TRACON. \\nIn this evaluation, all operations were executed with voice communication. Controllers were \\nasked to issue (based on equipage) RTA clearances or advisory-provided speed clearances to \\nSLIDR to make the flight adjustments necessary to meet the targeted crossing times in the \\nextended metering environment. Path Stretch advisories were also provided by automation to be \\nused in combination either with the RTA or speed clearance in cases where the flight adjustment \\nneeded could not be accomplished with speed or time alone. Controllers were notified if a Path \\nStretch was necessary once a flight crosses the FH for SLIDR (Figure 6). Controller participants \\nwere also instructed to meet MRP crossing times as accurately as possible while ensuring \\nseparation. Flights were expected to cross SLIDR within 30 seconds of the STA. Evaluation Phraseology 3.5\\nIn this evaluation, all operations were executed with voice communications. Controllers issued \\nspeeds, RTAs, path changes, or a combination of those clearances to meet the TBFM system \\ngenerated",
