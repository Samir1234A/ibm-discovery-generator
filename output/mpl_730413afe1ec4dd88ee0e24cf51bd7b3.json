Overview of Changes to the APM Framework and Its Supporting Principles The Advisory Groups deliberations tackled both foundational principles and APM classification conventions. With respect to foundational principles, the Advisory Group focused on the importance of viewing payment as a vehicle for driving delivery system transformation, and it closely reviewed key statements in the original White Paper to be sure they did not imply that payment reform was a goal unto itself. These discussions culminated in a new Principle 2, which articulates that payment reforms are only as successful as the delivery transformations they support. Advisory Group discussions also resulted in changes to the original Principles 2 and 5. First, they clarified that Category 2 APMs can be an endpoint for certain types of providers in specific markets. They also clarified that the strength of incentives should balance the potential for delivery system transformation against the risk of physicians taking on greater financial and insurance risk than they can manage. Figure 3, which illustrates the LANs national goals for payment reform, has been updated to reflect greater parity in clinical outcomes and cost management in Category 3 and Category 4 APMs. The Advisory Group believes that these changes address challenges that many small, rural, and safety net providers face when participating in APMs. The Advisory Group also carefully considered classification conventions used in the original APM Framework. Some of these discussions involved relatively minor modifications that would simplify and improve the LANs Progress Tracking efforts, such as the decision to consolidate Categories 2C and 2D into a single Category 2C for Pay-for-Performance. Other considerations included the need for additional patient protections in APMs with cost accountability. Accordingly, the Advisory Group decided to make appropriate care measures a requirement for Categories 3 and 4 APMs in order to give providers strong incentives to focus on eliminating care that does not help (and may harm) patients.3 The past several years have witnessed a considerable expansion of integrated finance and delivery systems i.e., joint ventures between insurance companies and health systems, insurance companies that own provider groups, and provider organizations that offer insurance products. Notable examples include not only Kaiser Permanente and Geisinger Health System, but also Vivity (a joint venture between Anthem and seven provider groups), the Allegheny Health Network (a joint venture between Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield and the West Pennsylvania Allegheny Health System), the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Intermountain Healthcare, and the Henry Ford Health System. Integrated finance and delivery systems are also expanding rapidly in the Medicare Advantage (MA) market, where \\n3 In this context, appropriate care measures cover topics such as unnecessary imaging, preventable hospitalizations, and adherence to clinical guidelines. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2546. 8 roughly 60% of new MA plans are provider-sponsored.4 In light of this growth and the potential for these arrangements to better coordinate care, the Advisory Group thought it important to consider a new Category to track payments in these systems. Upon consulting with organizations that are making investments in these areas, the Advisory Group determined that integrated finance and delivery systems have the potential to help build organizational culture and investment strategies around population health management; support investments in key delivery infrastructure, such as care management, and health information technology; advance linkages to community organizations/community health; and promote alignment of value-based financial incentives among plans and providers. The Advisory Group therefore created a new Category 4C, which will enable further assessment of the effectiveness of these organizations in increasing the value of care through these more highly integrated arrangements. The APM Framework and MACRA are aligned in the goal of moving payments away from FFS and into APMs that reduce the total cost of care (TCOC) and improve the quality of care. Both MACRA and the APM Framework establish designations for APMs that consider the extent to which payments are based on value (as opposed to volume). For MACRA, Advanced APMs receive special consideration, and for the APM Framework, Categories 3 and 4 mark the goal for national payment reform. MACRA and the APM Framework also both aspire to take provider variability into account when making these designations, to ensure they are responsive to the manifold settings in which health care is delivered nationwide. Therefore, comparisons between the two systems for designating level of APM advancement, and the identification of potential incongruities, offer an opportunity to properly designate payment arrangements for particular providers that are specially designed to reward high-value care. With one exception, all Advanced APMs under MACRA were classified in Categories 3 and 4, according to the original APM Framework. However, the two designation systems inconsistently classified the flagship CMS CPC+ Track 1 program, which fell into Category 2 in the original APM Framework. The Advisory Group therefore considered new conventions for Category 3, which highlighted opportunities for the LAN to adopt more nuanced criteria that better reflect the lessons CMS learned about implementing primary care APMs for the Medicare population. Specifically, CPC+ Track 1 showed that utilization measures can be expected to establish shared-savings arrangements without a formal financial benchmark when smaller primary care providers are unable to bear much financial risk. This type of arrangement may not be appropriate in all settings or market segments, and it will be important to evaluate whether it achieves its intended results for smaller primary care practices. However, the Advisory Group decided that CPC+ Track 1s utility for introducing cost accountability to primary care physicians taking care of the Medicare population warranted its inclusion in Category 3. Although there will be differences in the specific criteria that MACRA and the APM Framework use to categorize APMs,5 this modification will achieve complete alignment between designations made by MACRA and the LAN \\n4 Avalere.

For instance, MACRA highlights the intensity of risk as a distinguishing factor between APMs and Advanced APMs by quantifying a more than nominal amount of financial risk. Under the APM Framework, risk differentiates APMs (i.e., between a 3A and 3B classification), but the precise magnitude of risk is not specified. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2546. 9 Framework, such that all Advanced APMs under MACRA fall into Categories 3 and 4 in the updated Framework. Taken together, these changes to the original APM Framework reflect experiences and developments that have occurred since the original White Paper was initially released. The updates will help ensure that the APM Framework remains fundamental for payment and delivery reform. Changes are embedded in this refreshed White Paper in order to maintain a single source for the LANs perspectives on APM classification and goals for payment reform. The Advisory Group has incorporated public comments that it received, and it thanks all commenters for taking the opportunity to provide input on this work. The Case for Reforming the Health Care Payment System Like many health care stakeholders, the LAN is committed to driving payment approaches that improve the quality and safety of care, and the overall performance and sustainability of the U.S. health system. Collectively, we believe that making a positive impact on patient care and health should be the ultimate goal of payment reform, and we envision a health care system that provides person-centered care. For the purposes of this paper, and recognizing that the term may encompass additional characteristics that are not captured below, person-centered care means patients and their care teams form partnerships around high-quality,",

While the results for Filter 3 show that one of the peaks shifts downward and one peak shifts upward relative to the no- noise case. The shift in opposite directions for Filter 1 is what causes large errors in the E-field measurements shown in Figs. 11 and 14 for Filter 1. V. CONCLUSIONS The effects of band-limited white Gaussian noise on EIT and AT splitting, when performing atom-based RF E-field strength measurements using Rydberg atomic va- por were investigated. BLWGN has the effect of shift- FIG. 14. Comparison of E-field strength obtained from ex- perimental data with those obtained from the model. The x-axis is the input CW RF power to the antenna.

Shown here are the high-power noise (0 dB attenuation) cases for the three filters. ing (either red-shifted or blue-shifted) the peaks of the EIT lines depending on the noise conditions (band-width, center-frequency, and noise power). The BLWGN also has the effect of broadening the EIT lines. We present a model to predict these effects. The model incorpo- rates two contributions; (1) one including on resonance transitions between Rydberg states caused by the noise spectrum (analogous to decays driven by blackbody ra- diation) and (2) one including AC shifts caused by the noise source. The results of this model compare very well to the experimental data presented here. This indicates that these two contributions are required in a model in order to correctly predict the EIT signal in the presence of BLWGN. 13 The noise has the effect of modifying the EIT/AT sig- nal from that for the coherent RF field alone, which alters the ability to measure the E-field strength in the pres- ence of noise. The amount of deviation is a function of the noise parameters (band-width, center-frequency, and noise power). We show relative differences of measured E-field strengths for different CSNR, where we show the the relative difference increases for decreasing CSNR. The shifts and broadening of the EIT/AT signal caused by noise are dependent on the Rydberg states chosen for the experiment. With that said, for the Rydberg states used here, we can summarize that when the noise is red- shifted from the RF transition, it has a minimal effect on the ability to to measures CW RF E-fields. While the blue-shifted noise (i.e., Filter 1) has the strongest effect on the E-field measurements. Furthermore, besides understanding the effects of BLWGN on E-field strength measurements, there is a need to be able to detect various noise sources in gen- eral. In order to investigate if the EIT approach can be useful for detecting noise, we performed additional EIT experiments with various noise levels and at various tem- peratures (77 K to 400 K).
