  "sdl_extracted_summary": "a description of the effects of those risk factors. Such an assessment is \\ncrucial for risk management; by enabling risk awareness, risk mitigation, and risk-based decision \\nmaking. \\nA variety of risk assessment methods exist, across many industries [1], [2]. These methods all \\nhave the same basic steps in common: Determine what can go wrong1.\\nDetermine how often this happens2.\\nDetermine the extent of the consequences3.\\nDetermine if the assessed risk is acceptable4. Methods to perform the risk assessment vary widely across industry domains. Furthermore, even \\nwithin the same domain, the risk assessment can take different forms which may differ in \\ndimension. A primary driver of model design is the desired output: Will risk be expressed as a \\nnumerical value as a function of probability? Or will the risk be expressed as a qualitative term \\nexpressed linguistically or as a relative index on a normalized rating scale? This first design \\ndecision drives the selection of model expression (quantitative versus rule-based), and model \\ninputs (quantitative versus qualitative data).\\nRegardless of methodology, risk is the probability of an undesired outcome with the severity of \\nthat outcome. Risk (R) is the Probability (P) of Severity (S) Risk Assessment Model Dimensions / Evaluation Criteria2.1\\nIn evaluating risk modeling for airworthiness assessments, there are several dimensions along \\nwhich comparisons may be made, as indicated in the following list. There is no order or \\nweighting of these criteria. Nor are these criteria the only basis for the final recommendation. How is the risk model expressed? \\nWhat kind of input data feeds the approach?\\nWhat kind of output is produced? Additional metrics for model implementation evaluation include: Complexity of model\\nIntended use (as designed)\\nDecision support automation\\nRisk areas covered Risk to pedestrians on the ground-\\nRisk to other aircraft- ii\\n Risk of penetration of sensitive/restricted areas-\\nRisk due to human error (whether in planning, controlling, responding to -\\nunforeseen/adverse conditions) Model Expression2.1.1\\nModel expression refers to the formalism used to encode the risk computation. This may take the \\nform of fault and event trees [3], [4], mathematical formulations [5], risk matrices [6], rule-based \\napproach [7], or some combination of these and others [8]. Choice of representation is dependent \\non intended use and available data. \\nQuantitative models enable rapid exploration of input parameters. Trials (what-if tests) are easy \\nand inexpensive to run, replicate, and quantify. Probabilistic distributions of input parameters can \\nbe randomly sampled to explore the interactions among inputs, and results (e.g., most likely \\noutput).\\nQualitative models emphasize representation of a maximal set of risk factors. Presentation of \\nnumerical input and output of a model may take various formats such as formulas, look-up tables, \\nflow charts, and risk matrices. The rules which combine inputs are typically knowledge-driven, \\nmeaning that they are derived from subject matter expert knowledge elicitation instead of \\nformulas. Input Data2.1.2\\nRisk models vary in their data requirements. Input data can range from precise quantification of \\nrisk factor probabilities and probabilistic distributions to subjective assessments, expressed on a \\nnumerical scale, or a descriptive term (such as low and high). For example, the probability of \\na component failure may be expressed quantitatively as a point probability (e.g., 110-5) or as a \\nprobabilistic function (e.g., a normal distribution around a mean value). A qualitative reliability \\ninput may be expressed as very reliable.\\nQuantitative models will depend on quantitative data to compute a quantitative output, while \\nqualitative or non-numerical data can be used only by qualitative methods (e.g., rule-based \\nmodels). Outputs2.1.3\\nRisk model output is motivated by demands of the assessment problem and constrained by the \\nmodeling methodology and input data. Methods which produce a quantitative expression of the \\nseverity of a hazard, in conjunction with its probability of occurrence, are referred to as \\nquantitative methods.\\nInterpretation of a quantitative risk model output, probability of severity, is straightforward. For \\nexample, probability of an adverse effect during a particular time period, such as probability of \\nsUAS failures in one flight hour. Severity in this example relates sUAS failures to fatalities. \\nQuantitative models can be validated over time based on actual event statistics, however, this is \\nproblematic for rare events. As a substitute, the input probability of relatively more common \\nadverse events can be refined (e.g., motor failure). The model algorithm, how output is calculated \\nbased on input, can also be challenged and reevaluated by various researchers until a safe \\nconsensus is achieved. \\nQuantitative modeling can use both statistical and deterministic parameters to represent real iii\\n world situations. These values can be presented in various formats such as graphs, equations, \\ndiagrams, scatterplots, and tree diagrams. The model provides an abstraction that reduces a \\nproblem to its essential characteristics. The model describes, in a quantifiable way, the impact of \\nthe inputs on the output. Inputs represent parameters which can be determined, measured, or \\ndescribed probabilistically and the output is similarly numerical or probabilistic. \\nQuantitative risk assessment is sometimes also known as probabilistic risk assessment. The goal \\nis to use quantitative data (measurable, comparable) to support an evaluation whose result is a \\ncalculated expression of the severity of a hazard in conjunction with its probability of occurrence. \\nThere are various understandings and definitions of risk. [2], [9]. \\nProbabilistic risk assessment uses data to develop a probability distribution of risk. This enables \\nthe evaluation of input data variability and uncertainty and its effect on the risk assessment. Strengths and Weakness of Quantitative Modeling2.1.4\\nThe openly shared algorithm is the main strength of a quantitative approach to risk assessment. Increased model clarity: inputs and outputs are explicit\\nComparability\\nRepeatability\\nAutomation, modeling and simulation A risk model which shares its algorithm description is clear and comprehensible in the sense that \\nit specifies exactly how the inputs of the model are determined or measured. The formal \\nexpression relating the input parameters to the output can be verified by other researchers. \\nFor the same inputs, the model will always generate the same output. Because of this \\nconsistency, it is easy to compare model outputs under different conditions. Changes in output \\nare due only to changes in measurable input variables. Finally, a quantitative model with a clearly \\ndefined range of determined or measured inputs is programmable and can be run automatically to \\nsupport various modeling and simulation strategies, such as Monte Carlo methods.\\nIn contrast, the weaknesses of quantitative modeling are: The quality of the output is only as good as the quality of the input\\nNarrower scope of available features, since data is required to support probabilities\\nIt may ignore some important qualitative (non-quantifiable) differences for simplicity\\nIt may blur a desired distinction between high probability, low severity events, and low \\nprobability, high severity events (which may have the same risk score) A qualitative feature must be given a scale of numeric values (e.g., 1= Strongly Agree, 5= \\nStrongly Disagree). Not all qualitative features are amenable to this mapping, which can restrict \\nthe inputs. As such, in situations where the process to be modeled is incompletely understood or \\nspecified, model expressivity is lost and the model will be incomplete. Assumptions may be \\nneeded to fill in the unquantifiable aspects. Reducing a complex process into a simple equation \\nmay risk losing important distinctions. For example, events A and B may appear to have equal \\nrisk, when the product of the high likelihood and low severity of event A may be equal to the low \\nseverity and high likelihood of event B. iv\\n Knowledge-Driven Risk Assessment2.2\\nIn a knowledge-driven system, risk inference methods are based on variables, rules, and \\nrelationships derived from subject matter experts. Although a qualitative process may be \\nformalized and rigorous, it does not necessarily require a precise algorithm. The dominant feature \\nof such models is that input data may be qualitative, reflecting inputs which are not measurable \\nquantities, and output is qualitative. Output may be a risk classification, or relative risk index on \\nsome scale (such as 1 to 10). Qualitative inference methods may include matrices relating \\nlikelihood categories and severity categories to risk, such as the FAAs safety system \\nmanagement (SMS) risk matrix [6]. Other methods include event and fault trees, rule-based \\nsystems, and various combinations of such methods. Strengths and Weaknesses of Knowledge-Driven Assessment2.2.1\\nThe risk value inference process is a logical and repeatable process, which can consider a very \\nbroad range of risk and mitigation factors. For instance, in the SORA process, the guidance \\nindicates that more than 100 inputs are required for the risk assessment. At least 40 of the \\nrequisite inputs are quantifiable, measurable parameters, such as aircraft dimensions and mass. \\nOther inputs are qualitative (e.g., high/medium/low) and free text (e.g., name of aircraft design \\norganization). \\nThe breadth of inputs required for SORA indicate the span of the risk assessment. If a system is \\nmanufactured by a well-established company and undergoes regular maintenance and \\nconfiguration management, the risk may be assessed to be less than for a new applicant.\\nA knowledge-driven risk assessment is generally more labor-intensive and complex. There are a \\nseries of required steps, most of which are manually derived. Although the model is a logical and \\nrepeatable process, the complexity of input parameters entails a significant amount of subjectivity \\nby the assessor. i\\n Risk Modeling for Small UAS Airworthiness Assessment3\\nModeling sUAS mission risk, in terms of",

  "text": "are loaded into onboard avionics. There are significant airline costs to create and deploy customizations because they effectively change the aircrafts avionics and could potentially disrupt ground side data processing. Typically these loads simply activate existing FMS features with little effort. For a higher level of customization, operators can build their own message content that will respond to special request codes not claimed by current ARINC 702A definitions. Conversations with General Electrics Boeing 737 FMS experts and research into the Thales/Smiths Airbus FMS reveals internal FMS capabilities (e.g., airborne triggering mechanisms) that can be enabled by airline customers. These ready-to-use customizations may hold immediate value for continued research into ACARS downlink data processing. Built-in airborne triggers (e.g., time to destination) could easily ensure accurate flight plan reports are collected. For the GE system, the customizable downlink capabilities include: automated triggers (report an aircraft event, such as those described below), transactional (downlink responses to AOC or ATC uplinks), and FMS-CDU activity (status, errors, or faults). Along with the ability to enable or disable these report downlinks, the GE system also allows operators to customize what information messages will be downlinked. As Airbus and Boeing 2-6 define common features on their aircraft avionics, those same GE/Thales features are likely to be present in Honeywell or other suppler avionics offering similar report capability. Particularly useful are the automated event triggers for the GE 737 FMS that include: Five time-to-destination triggers When flight plan modification is executed (EXEC key-in) Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) change Destination airport change Destination runway change In-Air (speed and strut switch) Cruise level entry FMS wind setting/experienced Modifying these triggers was discussed with Delta Air Lines, but determined to be out of scope for the initial data collection effort given potential complexity of these modifications. Revisiting these options with Delta Air Lines, or use of ACARS customization during discussions with other airlines, is recommended for future efforts. An airline fleet with more airframe uniformity (e.g., Alaska Airlines or Southwest Airlines, who predominantly use Boeing 737 aircraft) may allow the airline to be less at risk of disruption when modifying datalink behavior. Conversations with Alaskas ACARS focal indicated they perform frequent ADDB updates. 2.4 Data Collection Considerations The following data collection considerations are intended to better match data needs to an airlines specific ACARS configuration and operating procedures. An ideal case is an airlines willingness to freely change their ACARS data operations to match the project needs. As that is unlikely without significant resource investment, coordination meetings need to identify project data needs, and balance with the airlines ability and willingness to meet those needs. The considerations are: Communicate and verify project use cases of ACARS data with airline Identify airline data sensitivity and agreements, data processing impacts, data protection \\nrequirements Determine current ACARS usage, operating procedures of airline, current and potential \\nACARS trigger mechanisms, and aircraft type variations Verify available ACARS data content matches project needs If necessary, determine airline willingness to modify or add ACARS transmissions or \\noperating procedures Define data transfer and archiving methodology, such as e-mail/FTP transfers between \\nparties or direct ACARS access 2.4.1 Delta Air Lines Collection Details This study required an approach procedure identifier already present in Delta Air Lines ACARS collection scheme. Delta Air Lines datalink process was not significantly modified MITRE CAASD received samples from their standard ongoing AOC downlink monitoring activities. MITRE CAASD and Delta Air Lines Airlines agreed to use Delta Air Lines existing in-range 3-7 AOC report trigger for the initial collection activity. The Delta Air Lines in-range downlink is crew initiated as a step in their arrival briefing, so the timing of this downlink can vary. Once the in-range downlink is received by the AOC, a request for the current flight plan is automatically uplinked; the downlink of the approach procedure message is also automated. Requirements for enhanced downlink trigger mechanisms that isolate the approach phase of flight or capture all flight plan changes were not specifically addressed with this work. As mentioned in Section 2.3.2, automated FMS trigger points could easily reduce planned vs. flown errors on approach procedure identification by using a plan modification or time to destination downlink triggers. Making that a hard requirement would have increased costs to Delta Air Lines and increased the time needed to complete this initial data analysis effort. The value of altering an airlines ACARS data requests and specific trigger points must be acceptable to airline participants. 2.5 Other Uses of Downlink Data This document has a narrow focus of leveraging the REQFPN,RP (request, flight plan, active route) message to derive approach procedure utilization data. Customizing and expanding on the downlink messages and the ability to set the downlink triggers could allow for the use of ACARS in many other areas of research including: Safety studies (vertical performance assessment, procedure blunders, discrepancy in \\napproach clearance versus flown procedure) Operational concepts validation (e.g., Time of Arrival Control, Interval Management) Trajectory Modeling Applications (e.g., comparing ground automation trajectories to \\nFMS trajectories) Validation of algorithms (e.g. SID/STAR usage algorithms, ATC-pilot voice \\ncommunications) The above uses of the data will require greater operator involvement and buy-in. MITRE CAASD continues to develop relationships with various operator and will look to expand data collection as needed to support FAA research activities. Downlink Data Analysis \\nMITRE CAASD conducted an initial analysis with the Delta Air Lines downlink data to verify applicability to the approach utilization use case. The following sections show these analysis results, highlighting the scope, features, and accuracy of downlink data received, planned instrument approach trends, and the utility of downlink data for several use cases. Further, the data analysis results highlight some limitations of the in-range call as the primary trigger mechanism. Delta Air Lines provided MITRE CAASD downlink data for most days in May-July 2018 for its B757 and B767 fleets. MITRE CAASD ingested these downlink messages, and fused the messages to published procedure data within Digital Terminal Procedures Publication (d-TPP) and flight trajectory data from System-Wide Information Management Flight data Publication Service (SFDPS), and produced data visualizations and analysis results. 3-8 3.1 Completeness of Downlink Data Delta Air Lines agreed to test the trigger mechanism and initial data sharing for its B757 and B767 fleet. Figure 3-1 confirms that the vast majority of downlink messages received from Delta Air Lines are within the B757 and B767 fleet. Outliers are described more in Section 3.3. \\nFigure 3-1. Downlink Messages by Aircraft Type \\nFigure 3-2. Daily Downlink Data Availability (May-June 2018) 3-9 Figure 3-2 shows daily downlink data coverage for the Delta Air Lines B757 and B767 fleet arriving in the CONUS; some days in May, late June and early July 2018 were not included in the downlink data sent from Delta Air Lines to MITRE CAASD. Figure 3-3 compares the number of flights for which a downlink message was received to the number of arrivals at each airport. Excluding days for which no downlink data was transferred from Delta Air Lines to MITRE CAASD, this ratio ranges from 75 to 85% of Delta Air Lines B757 and 767 flights across top Continental US (CONUS) airports; note, downlink data is not available for arrivals to non-CONUS airports with the current data sharing architecture. \\nFigure 3-3. Flights with Downlink Messages vs. Arrival Counts While the data does not represent all Delta Air Lines operations, there is sufficient data to conduct proof-of-concept data analyses. However, if this downlink data were to be used for broader studies that required full coverage, MITRE CAASD would need to work with the airlines to ensure downlinks are delivered more consistently. 3.2 Approach Procedure Analyses The initial use case for the downlink data is evaluation of approach utilization across the NAS to help the FAA achieve PBN transition goals and related benefits. Figure 3-4 below shows the frequency of respective approach types loaded into the FMS at downlink time for the Delta Air Lines B757 and B767 fleet. The approach type in the FMS route plan is usually Instrument Landing System (ILS), with RNAV (GPS) and RNAV (RNP) approaches also being planned. 3-10 \\nFigure 3-4. Planned Approach Type in FMS at Downlink Time Figure 3-5 shows this approach breakdown at an airport level. This type of breakdown has not been possible to create via the trajectory-based analysis in the PBN Analysis System. Most airports utilize ILS as the primary approach, but those that also rely on RNAV procedures include John F Kennedy International Airport (KJFK), Orlando International Airport (KMCO), San Francisco International Airport (KSFO), Southwest Florida International Airport (KRSW), Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (KFLL), San Diego International Airport (KSAN), and Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport (KMSY). It is important to note that these results reflect the approach loaded in the FMS at downlink time, which may not be the ultimately executed approach type. Section 3.4 expands on the importance of downlink timing on accuracy of the approach, along with data that highlights limitations with the downlink trigger mechanism used in this study. 3-11 \\nFigure 3-5.
