Public Release Case Number 18-4046 ii Abstract \\nIn Fiscal Year (FY) 2018, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) tasked the MITRE CAASD Corporations Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (MITRE CAASD) with industry collaboration to develop a framework for collecting, storing, and analyzing Flight Management System (FMS) planned route information via Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) datalink. This work is part of a broader activity MITRE CAASD is supporting to track Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) implementation and use in the National Airspace System (NAS). MITRE CAASD explored mutually agreeable methods with Delta Air Lines to collect and archive FMS route downlink messages to provide evidence of the flown approach procedure. MITRE CAASD and Delta Air Lines worked together to ensure that route information could be exchanged with no equipment changes or flight crew involvement. Further, coordination with Delta Air Lines ensured the collection scheme minimized impact to their operations. This work sought to refine approach procedure identification by leveraging existing datalink methods and airline initiated active flight plan downlink requests. Analysis of initial data samples demonstrated MITRE CAASDs ability to extract and identify approach procedure information and correlate with other operational datasets to perform analysis and confirm the flown approach procedure. The methodology for collecting and analyzing downlinked flight data is outlined in this document, as well as recommendations for future airline outreach efforts and evolution of the framework. One finding of this research is the importance of timely flight plan downlink reports. If the downlink message is received too early, the planned approach may be inaccurate due to flight plan changes between the downlink time and execution of the approach. If the flight plan datalink message is collected too late (e.g., at touchdown), the executed approach may be cleared from the FMS reports. MITRE CAASD achieved the goal of proving the support value of targeted downlinks to improve MITRE CAASDs PBN analytics. Expansion of this datalink effort to examine other available data sets may offer opportunities in the future to support safety studies and validation and operational analysis of Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) concepts such as Trajectory-Based Operations (TBO). iii Acknowledgments \\nThe authors would like to acknowledge Mahesh Balakrishna, Clark Britan, and David Gouldey from MITRE CAASD for their contributions and assistance in this work. Thanks is also due to the Delta Air Lines for agreeing to provide downlink data and its staff for being willing to meet and participate in the initial data collection efforts, specifically Mike Manatrizio for his technical expertise and execution of data transfers to MITRE CAASD. We would also like to thank Delta Air Lines Captains Mark Bradley and Brian Swain for their support, guidance, and corporate advocacy that made the collection of operational data possible.

Downlink Messages by Aircraft Type \\nTable A-1. Flight History and Intent Data Content \\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) faces major challenges in meeting future demand for airport and airspace resources. While meeting demand, the FAA must also balance its goals to protect the environment, reduce traffic delays, and improve operational safety. The FAA is addressing these issues through the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), which relies heavily on Performance Based Navigation (PBN) procedures and optimized airspace design to enhance system safety, access, capacity, efficiency, and environmental benefits. National Airspace System (NAS) stakeholders have also been requesting PBN procedures to be implemented more expeditiously to reap benefits sooner. To this end, the FAA has implemented thousands of PBN en route, departure, arrival, and approach procedures throughout the NAS. PBN, referring to any combination of area navigation (RNAV) and Required Navigation Performance (RNP), is a system using modern navigation technology that permits aircraft to fly more direct routes and conform very well to the planned path. Translating this ability of flying more direct and less dispersed routes into operationally beneficial procedures is complex and dependent upon many factors. The advanced navigational technology needed for some PBN procedures and the complexity in developing PBN procedures brings significant costs to both the FAA as well as the users. NAS stakeholders therefore are keen on tracking the current state of PBN in the NAS. To address the need to track PBN use in the NAS, the FAA tasked the MITRE CAASD Corporations Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (MITRE CAASD) to develop automated capabilities to derive and report on metrics to help characterize PBN operations in the NAS. The resulting Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) Analysis System derives various metrics through a combination of trajectory-based Threaded Track Flight Story (TTFS) data, aircraft intent (filed/amended flight plans) from Traffic Flow Management System (TFMS), and aircraft equipage data. Determining procedure usage via these data sources is a complex process, requiring advanced algorithms, data fusion, and extensive quality assurance measures [1]. 1.1 Motivation for Research There are significant challenges and limitations associated with tracking procedure conformance and usage through radar track and flight plan data. Approach procedures present a particular challenge in that the approach procedure clearances are not entered into the flight plan. Therefore, with the existing PBN Analysis System framework, approach procedure usage determination would need to rely solely on radar track data. However, overlays and common waypoints may exist between a conventional and a PBN approach procedure, or vectors to Instrument Landing System (ILS) approaches may be similar to defined PBN paths. Further, aircraft flying straight-in approaches without a downwind leg often follow a very similar trajectory regardless of approach type, making it difficult to determine usage based solely on track points. As such, the PBN Analysis System currently only determines approach usage for Required Navigational Performance (RNP) approaches that contain a Radius-to-Fix (RF) leg, representing only ~1% of Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) arrivals in the NAS. These RF legs provide a unique procedure geometry to other approach types, which can be monitored for conformance. 2-2 In order to identify usage of approaches other than RNP approaches with RF turns, MITRE CAASD is exploring the use of other types of data, including Air Traffic Control (ATC) voice communications, and aircraft downlinked intent. Downlink data may not be scalable to a NAS- wide level due to the need for operator involvement in setting up the downlink capability and availability on only certain aircraft types. However, even limited data is useful to evaluate approach utilization, and validate approach-related metrics derived from ATC-pilot voice communications and trajectory-based analysis. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2018, the FAA tasked MITRE CAASD with industry collaboration to develop a framework for collecting, storing, and analyzing FMS planned route information via datalink. This work seeks to improve approach procedure identification by leveraging existing datalink methods and airline initiated active flight plan downlink requests. Data analysis of initial data samples was pursued to demonstrate the ability to correlate downlinks with other flight trajectory analysis to confirm flown approach procedures. The legal, logistics, and processing methodology to collect and analyze downlinked flight data are defined, as well as recommendations for future airline outreach efforts and data integration. Obtaining Aircraft Information via Datalink \\nAircraft provisioned with Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) flight and communication management avionics enable airline operation centers (AOCs) to collect flight data for monitoring the companys day-to-day operations. This ACARS capability offers a variety of standard and customizable messages to manage aircraft flight planning and execution. Airline agreements to access existing operation reports have proven to be a viable source for MITRE CAASD research data [2] but can be limited by the airlines established data processes. What is available depends on what chosen subset of ACARS messages operators have deployed in their fleet. The following sections discuss current and potential ACARS message options based on coordination meetings with",
