  "text": "Staff celebrated its 65th anniversary. In recognition of that event, the chief of the department, Colonel-General Vyacheslav Zherebtsov, penned an article on operational art for the paper Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star). He wrote that discussing operational art was now an obligation, since the large battles of World War II had been replaced with different armed conflicts (internal, border, etc.) due to separatism and the escalation of such conflicts, such as in Chechnya, on the soil of interethnic, territorial, religious, and other differences.[footnoteRef:29] This has required securing victory through skill and ability instead of just by numbers, and required a reassessment of how to implement operational art. Peacekeeping, for example, has become a new direction for operational art. A pressing issue has become the adaptation of the theory and practice of operational art to the radical changes in the military-political situation at the turn of the century, and the need to learn lessons and draw conclusions from the experience of local wars and armed conflicts of recent decades[footnoteRef:30] [29: Vyacheslav Zherebtsov, Military School: Ensuring That the Thinking Is Ahead of the Times, Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star), 7 April 2001, p. 2.] [30: Ibid.] The direction of military art in the next 10-15 years, Zherebtsov predicted, would take the following directions:\\nArmed struggle will transform into an information-focused armed confrontation;\\nThere will be a new perception of operational arts content, to include its principles, forms, and methods of conducting operations under conditions of an information-focused confrontation and the massive use of precision weapons;\\nNew ways and means of resolving tasks will be unveiled to confront modern interstate and intrastate opposition;\\nReliable nuclear deterrence must be ensured and there must be an increase in the combat capability and combat readiness of force groupings;\\nProblems associated with repulsing strikes by superior enemy forces must be resolved;\\nThe quality of command and control must be enhanced along with support for combat operations and for the mental and psychological preparation of personnel.[footnoteRef:31] [31: Ibid.] All of his predictions have proven to be correct.\\nLieutenant-General A. N. Stolyarov of the Operational Art Department\\nIn 2006 Lieutenant-General A. N. Stolyarov was appointed as the head of the Operational Art Department at the General Staff Military Academy. In 2007 he wrote an article for the journal Voennaya Mysl (Military Thought) on the history of the department since its founding in the 1930s. Near the beginning of World War II there were a few significant studies produced on operational art. They were:\\nG. S. Issersons three works, The Evolution of Operational Art, Fundamental Principles of an In-Depth Operation; and The Initial War Period;\\nE. A. Shilovskys three works, The Operation, Breakthrough and Exploitation, and Fundamental Principles of an Offensive Army Operation; and\\nA. V. Kirpichnikovs Operations by Modern Mobile Armies[footnoteRef:32] [32: A. An. Stolyarov, The Evolution and Development of the Theory and Practice of Operational Art at the General Staff Military Academy, Military Thought (in English), Volume 3 2007. It is likely that this was an East View publication.] The Operational Art Department contributed to military theorys development during WWII. Professors closely followed wartime experience, identifying new trends and patterns in military arts evolution, and developing recommendations for the conduct of operations, battles, and engagements. In 1948, experiences from the war were included in an in-depth study of new socio-political factors, modern warfare, changes in combat configurations of large strategic formations, and how the organizational structure of military units would affect operational art. These results were used to examine major aspects of the organization and conduct of operations for the initial period of war.[footnoteRef:33] [33: Ibid.] At the end of the first post-war period, 1945-1953, A Comprehensive Course in the Operational Art was produced. From 1954-1961 the department studied problems of operational art with respect to nuclear warfare. It also produced a theoretical work titled A Course in the Operational Art in four volumes, published between 1957-1959. From 1962-1971, work was performed on developing forms and methods of training and indoctrination for military personnel. Further, new texts were produced on front and army operations dealing with matters concerning the preparation and conduct of operations with the use of nuclear and other types of new weapons, to include future ones.[footnoteRef:34] [34: Ibid.] During the period 1972-1990, attention was given to breakthroughs in the development of conventional weaponry and to new forms and methods of operations using them. In particular this pertained to precision weaponry and its impact on future operations. From 1988-1996 the Operational Art Department developed 16 concepts (not specified further) that were enshrined in legally enforceable documents of the General Staff.[footnoteRef:35] However, it was noted that changes in that period did include those associated with meeting engagements and counter assault and counter insurgency operations, as well as operational concealment, deception, and camouflage. In 1993, it was noted that research regarding local wars and armed conflicts and peacekeeping operations was expanded along with the interaction of branches and arms of service and a priority focus provided to the preparation and conduct of front and army operations in a large-scale war with reduced-strength formations.[footnoteRef:36] [35: Ibid.] [36: Ibid.] At the start of the 21st century, a new evolution of operational art took place, Stolyarov added. This was due to the growing evidence of the threat not only of armed conflicts and large-scale terrorist attacks, but also local and regional wars affecting the Russian Federation.[footnoteRef:37] A significant landmark in 2002 was the publication of the work Operational Art: The Present and the Future. Developed by a team of writers, to include Lieutenant-General A. N. Zakharov and Major-General E. G. Korotchenko, the work identified trends and problems with improving the concept. A few years later, new textbooks were produced on the fundamentals of operational art. Defensive and offensive operations were praised, as was a chapter on the basic principles of operational art. Combined-arms operations, forms of military action, effective engagements of enemy forces, and a substantiation of combat strength levels of force in strategic sectors were also addressed.[footnoteRef:38] [37: Ibid.] [38: Ibid.] Stolyarov noted that operational art faces new tasks, such as containing an aggressor at an early stage of a crisis situation, and conducting large-scale operations simultaneously in several regions amid a wide use of new weaponry. This may also include the employment of unconventional forms and methods of combat action, he noted. There exists a pressing need for conducting air and defensive operations by operational-strategic groupings in strategic sectors, and information warfare operations must also be countered. The countering of weaponry includes precision guided weapons, automated command and control, and reconnaissance systems. The operational art department is concentrating its efforts on developing new, unconventional forms and methods of employing large strategic formations and groupings of forces in both large-scale and local wars, as well as in armed conflicts.[footnoteRef:39] The department is analyzing and forecasting the consequences of expected trends in military developments as a whole and operational art in particular. The author ended this article in 2007 noting that in the very near future, substantial changes will occur in the theory and practice of operational art.[footnoteRef:40] [39: Ibid.] [40: Ibid.] Major-General V. K. Kopytko of the Operational Art Department\\nMajor-General V. K. Kopytko became a professor at the Operational Art Department of the General Staff in 2000. He wrote in 2008 on the Evolution of Operational Art for the journal Military Thought and defined operational art as a system of theoretical knowledge and practical recommendations on how to prepare and conduct different forms of military operations at the operational-strategic, operational, and operational-tactical levels.[footnoteRef:41] His article was broken down into specific sections addressing the issue of military art; a history of the development of operational art (from WW I to 2008); a definition of operational art; a breakdown of the theory and practice of operational art and the tasks that accompanied them; the structure of operational art at the current stage; and the impact of objective and subjective causes and conditions that assist in the modern development of operational art. This section will only address the last two elements of Kopytkos article, since many of the historical aspects were covered in Stolyarovs presentation. [41: V. K. Kopytko, The Evolution of Military Art, Military Thought (in English), Volume 1 2008.] Kopytko wrote that operational art is composed of the following: combined arms operational art (combined arms of large strategic formations), operational art of the services and the centrally controlled arms (Strategic Missile Troops, Airborne Troops, and Space Troops), and operational art of the operational rear services. The structure is not constant but develops in line with the evolution of both weaponry and new combat arms and forces. The impact of subjective factors on operational art is considerable but only if analysts fully and comprehensively estimate the objective factors before them.[footnoteRef:42] [42: Ibid.] The influence of objective factors on operational art include a host of issues, such as: \\nThe military-political situation in the world; \\nQualitative and quantitative improvements in weaponry and equipment; \\nThe states internal economic, political, demographic, and social condition; \\nThe state of the Armed Forces; \\nThe composition and state of the Armed Forces of",
