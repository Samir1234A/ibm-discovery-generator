  "sdl_extracted_summary": "the system was not\\ncorrecting (e.g., Bone et al., 2008a). However, this effect was not necessarily observed in the\\ncurrent study. The majority of pilots felt that they had a clear understanding of their spacing\\nand how well it was being achieved. This, coupled with high IM speed conformance and\\nminimal initiated speeds not issued by IM, indicated they appeared to trust the performance of\\nthe system and were not confused by the differential ground speed. As with other simulations,\\nthere were pilots that reported wanting more salient new IM speed annunciations, including\\nmentions of an aural annunciation. 2-50 2.5.2.2 Flight Deck Display Spacing Information Research Needs\\nAs can be seen from past work, much is understood about useful IM flight deck display\\nfeatures. However, some questions remain open. Key topics that still need to be resolved are\\nrelated to the necessary and appropriate spacing and trend information as well as the\\nappropriate alerting associated with IM speed changes and deviations. Appropriate alerting to IM speed changes has been challenging to specify. Some pilots have\\nexpressed a desire for aural alerting, though overall pilot feedback has been varied on whether\\naural alerting is necessary at all, and, if so, for what issue (e.g., new IM speed, deviation from\\nIM speed). There are also some concerns about the intrusiveness and the appropriateness of\\naural alerting. This is an area where further study is necessary. For the spacing and trend information, past simulations have examined different display\\nfeatures to support the flight crews in their desire to monitor the progress of and trust in the\\nIM operation. The spacing information has taken on numerous forms including: current interval\\nrelative to the ABP, projected interval at the ABP, differential ground speed, closure rate,\\nstraight-line range, etc. Past work has shown that certain information can lead to confusion, additional workload and\\nhead-down time, or lack of use. Most past work has found some analog, graphical display of\\nthis information to be most useful. Some work has been successful in specifying and requiring a\\nfeature for conveying required spacing relative to current spacing and spacing trend\\ninformation (i.e., Hoffman et al., 2006). However, other past work has continued to recommend\\n(e.g., Bone et al., 2008a; Baxley et al., 2014) a similar feature, yet the exact implementation has\\nbeen difficult to specify / develop. DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a) includes requirements and\\nrecommendations for a progress indicator that should now be considered in the design of such\\na feature. This is an area that would benefit from additional study. The past work shows that an ideal, or even reasonable minimum, implementation has been\\nchallenging to finalize. Some tools may also only be necessary for certain IM algorithms (e.g., a\\nfast / slow indicator in the NASA work). This HITL simulation will continue to study these issues by examining the minimum\\nimplementation defined in DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a) and an implementation that adds additional\\nelements to increase pilot confidence in the operation. 3-1 3 Method\\nA majority of the simulation methodology described in this section was reviewed with key FAA\\nstakeholders during the concept evaluations (reviewed in Section 2.4.2.3). Reviews of the\\nmethodology allowed the stakeholders to provide feedback that could be incorporated in the\\nfinal simulation design. After incorporating inputs, dry run testing was executed with internal\\nand external participants. Suggestions for changes from the development activities were\\nincorporated prior to data collection activities. 3.1 Simulation Environment\\nThe simulation was conducted in the MITRE IDEA Laboratory. The simulation utilized controller,\\nflight crew, and pseudo-pilot workstations from past ADS-B simulations that were modified as\\nnecessary for this effort. The following sections describe the utilized capabilities. 3.1.1 Flight Deck Workstation\\nThe flight deck simulator consisted of a typical Boeing 777 flight deck layout as shown in Figure\\n3-1. The equipment included standard elements such as a MCP, two radio management panels,\\nEICAS, a Flight Management System (FMS) with CDU interfaces, dual PFDs, and dual navigation\\ndisplays. The simulator also included a 180-degree out-the-window visual capability. New traffic\\ndisplay components were added to accommodate IM (i.e., elements on the CDTI traffic display\\nand AGD). Two CDTI traffic displays were hosted on auxiliary displays: one at the captains\\neleven oclock position and the other located at the First Officers (FOs) one oclock position.\\nThe AGD was located above the stand-by attitude indicator. The locations of the CDTI traffic\\ndisplay and AGD are shown in Figure 3-2. The utilized CDTI traffic display and AGD elements\\nwere based on requirements for ADS-B and IM (DO- 317B / RTCA, 2014, DO-361 / RTCA, 2015a).\\nMost all the requirements were met, however, some were not implemented based on the\\nexpectation that they would not be utilized in the simulation (e.g., IM turn requirements). The\\nIM algorithm utilized was specified in DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a) and is described further in Section\\n3.1.2. The flight deck IM equipment did not have an interface to the FMS or autothrottle system\\nbased on the desire to examine a near-term, retrofit implementation. The following sections\\nreview the IM implementation in detail. 3-2 Figure 3-1. Flight Deck Simulator Figure 3-2. CDTI Traffic Display and AGD Locations 3-3 3.1.1.1 CDTI\\nPer DO-317B (RTCA, 2014, p. 96), the CDTI is defined as the displays and controls necessary to\\nsupport [ADS-B In applications] \\ncontrol sub-elements. Based on that definition, the CDTI implementation in this simulation\\nconsisted of two display elements: the CDTI traffic display and the AGD. As noted previously, the IM features were based on requirements in DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a).\\nDO-361 (RTCA, 2015a) specifies five CDTI states: Awaiting entry: IM operation is not yet active but system / input interface is ready for\\nflight crew entry. Evaluate: IM information is being processed and is available for flight crew coordination\\n confirmation. Execute: IM operation is active. Suspend: IM operation is temporarily inactive. Terminate: IM operation is complete / inactive.\\nDO-361 (RTCA, 2015a) also defines over 20 information elements (e.g., IM speed, ASG, suspend\\nindication, alerts) that have different display requirements per each of the five CDTI states.\\nInformation elements are either required to be displayed, available to be displayed with simple\\naction, or required to not be displayed. Some of the information elements are required to be\\ndisplayed in the primary field of view. Other information elements are also recommended to be\\ndisplayed (e.g., the graphical route of the lead aircraft). The required features were\\nimplemented per the standard. Particular features of interest for this simulation and further\\ndescription include the progress indictor, feasibility check status indication, and the IM speed\\nconformance monitoring status visual advisory. The behavior of the IM speed conformance is defined in DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a). After an IM\\nspeed is presented to the flight crew, an 11 second delay is activated that allows time for the\\nflight crew and aircraft to react to the new speed. After the 11 seconds has transpired, the\\naircrafts current speed is compared to an expected speed change profile (0.5 knots [kts] per\\nsecond), built as a linear change of speed between the current aircraft speed and the IM speed.\\nIf the aircraft deviates from that speed change profile by more than 5 knots (faster for a\\ndeceleration or slower for an acceleration), the IM speed conformance visual and aural advisory\\nis displayed to the flight crew. When the aircraft speed is brought within 5 knots of the IM\\nspeed, the speed conformance monitoring stops and no additional advisories are provided.\\nMonitoring is stopped at this point because the flight crew is within acceptable tolerances of\\nthe IM speed. If any corrections are necessary after that point, a new IM speed will be\\npresented and monitoring will be resumed. The HITL simulation implementation of the conformance monitoring and alerting\\nunintentionally deviated from that defined in DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a). The HITL implementation\\ntriggered the advisory at any speed off the expected speed change profile (i.e., the 5 kt\\ntolerance was not implemented). It also advised after the aircrafts speed got within 5 knots of 3-4 the IM speed, but then again went greater than 5 knots of the profile speed (i.e., the\\nmonitoring and alerting was not inhibited after the aircraft was within 5 knots of the IM speed). Per DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a), the feasibility check status indication was provided when the\\nequipment determined the ASG could not be achieved even if the IM trail aircraft flew its\\nfastest or slowest speeds relative to the speed profile. It was only provided during the achieve\\nstage when greater than 30 NM from the ABP. A visual advisory was provided to the flight crew.\\nIf the aircraft was unable to slow enough to achieve the ASG [as determined by the equation\\n(Predicted Spacing Interval [PSI] + 0.15 x time-to-go [TTG]) < ASG], the flight crew was provided\\nwith the message: Not feasible, ASG too large. If the aircraft was unable to speed up enough\\nto achieve the ASG [as determined by the equation (PSI 0.11 x TTG) > ASG] the flight crew was\\nprovided with the message: Not feasible, ASG too small. The multiplier for the TTG value is\\nlarger because the aircraft has a greater capability to slow down than it does to speed up. For time-based ASGs, a progress indicator is required to be provided to the flight crew for\\nsituation awareness information during the maintain stage and when within 30 NM of the ABP\\nfor the achieve stage. At a minimum, the progress indication is defined as simply the display of\\nthe numerical values of the ASG and either the PSI (during the achieve stage) or the Measured\\nSpacing Interval (MSI) (during the maintain stage)3.

  "text": "well as concept evaluations prior to this\\nsimulation. Three main features were added for IM: an IM clearance window, aircraft role in and status of\\nIM in the aircraft data block, and a slot marker color change. This section will provide\\nintroductory / background information and then review the specific features. IM states were shown in previous simulations, though not all the states were the same (e.g.,\\nAligne et al., 2003; Benson et al., 2011; Baxley et al., 2016). For this simulation, the following\\nstates were defined from a ground system perspective and were relevant to the IM interface: Pre-initiation: Automation is evaluating pairs of aircraft for IM. Eligible pairs are\\npresented to the controller as an IM operation proposal. Initiation: Automation has proposed the IM clearance to the controller but the IM\\noperation has not been started. Conduct: IM proposal has been accepted by the controller and is active if the controller\\nissued the clearance and the flight crew engaged IM. Suspension: IM operation is temporarily inactive. Termination: IM operation is inactive.\\nEach of the states can have sub-states related to the validity and feasibility of the operation (as\\nshown in Figure 3-23). Transitions between states were either through controller or automation\\naction. See Appendix A for further information on the validity and feasibility checks. Controller\\ninputs to change states are shown in Table 3-1. 3-23 Figure 3-23.

Validity checks were made to determine whether the criteria for initiating IM\\nwere met. If any of the validity check failed, the clearance was not proposed to the controller.\\nFeasibility checks were also conducted prior to proposing and during any eligible IM clearance\\nproposal. Feasibility checks determined whether the IM operation could achieve the ASG with\\nspeed alone (the equivalent of the TSAS early / late indicator). If any of the feasibility checks\\nfailed, that information was presented to the controller in the status field as Eligible No\\nSpeed. In order to overcome the feasibility issue, the controller needed to provide a vector or\\nspeed greater or less than that IM would provide (i.e., greater or less than 15% of the profile\\nspeed). Feasibility checks were also conducted during the suspended and terminated states\\n(see Appendix A). 3.1.3.3.1 IM Clearance Window\\nBased on past work, it was determined that an IM clearance window should be used to provide\\ninformation that the controller would communicate as part of the IM clearance. The STARS\\ndisplay did not have a metering list to integrate the IM information into, so one had to be\\ndeveloped. It was determined that the clearance window should also show the status of the clearance\\ninformation (e.g., a proposed IM clearance versus an active IM operation). The information\\nprovided in the IM clearance window is expected to support that shown in the data block. Such\\ninformation may be necessary if not all states are shown in the data block (e.g., suspension or\\ninvalid) or may be necessary to specify that status of each pair in the list so data blocks do not\\nneed to be cross referenced. Four of the five defined states were shown to the controller. Pre-initiation and initiation were\\ncombined and labeled as Eligible. Conduct was labeled as Active. Suspension and\\ntermination were labeled as Suspended and Terminated respectively. If the clearance was determined to be valid and feasible, the clearance information and an\\nEligible status was provided in the IM clearance window to the controller with the trail\\naircraft. The information in the IM clearance window was only shown to the controller with the\\ntrail aircraft, whether or not that controller also had the lead aircraft. The clearance could be\\naccepted or rejected by the controller. If the clearance was rejected, the Status field changed to\\nRejected. The text remained for 30 seconds prior to the full IM clearance proposal being 3-25 removed. This delay allowed for awareness of the rejected operation and to allow for re-\\nactivation if the rejection was in error. If an operation had been rejected, it was not proposed\\nagain to the same controller / sector. However, it was proposed to the final controller. The\\nsame held true for terminated operations. If the clearance was accepted, instead of rejected,\\nthe status field changed to Active. The order of the IM clearances in the IM clearance window were based on the runway\\nsequence. This means a new proposal did not always appear at the top of the list but could\\nappear somewhere further down the list based on the lead aircraft sequence number for the\\nrunway. This order was consistent with the order of the TSAS timeline. The text in the window was color-coded to indicate different statuses (shown in Figure 3-24 and\\nsummarize with other information in Table 3-2 at the end of this section). White text indicated\\nan action was possible (i.e., activation possible). The white text status states were one of the\\nfollowing: Eligible, Eligible No Speed, or Suspended. Green text indicated an IM\\noperation had been accepted by the controller. The status state was Active. Yellow text\\nindicated an action was required (i.e., termination or a maneuver). The yellow text status states\\nwere one of the following: Active Invalid, Active No Speed, Suspended Invalid,\\nSuspended No Speed, or Terminated, Terminated Invalid, or Terminated No\\nSpeed. Dark gray text indicated the information was going to be removed (based the proposal\\nbeing inactive). The dark gray status state was Rejected. Note that the Terminated status\\nwas intended to be dark gray instead of yellow but the mismatch was not detected in time to\\ncorrect the error before data collection. Figure 3-24.

Fields of note will be\\nreviewed next. The clearance types used in the simulation were achieve-by then maintain and capture then\\nmaintain. They were abbreviated as Achieve and Capture for brevity in the display and\\nwhen issuing the clearance over the voice frequency. The ASG in the spacing goal field, was\\ncalculated by TBFM and was the trail aircraft STA at the ABP minus the lead aircraft STA at the\\nABP. The ASG had an IM aware buffer reduction of 0.1 NM based on the expected low\\nspacing variance provided by IM (as compared to metering only operations). The ASG was\\npresented with a 1-second resolution. Next to the ASG was a spacing prediction value in parentheses (shown in some scenarios).\\nBenson et al. (2011) and Aligne et al. (2003) reported that controllers found the predicted\\ninterval at the ABP to be useful. It may become more critical as the ABP is close to or within a\\ncontrollers airspace, as was the case for this simulation. Peterson et al. (2012) also reported\\ncontrollers finding it useful to having delay information. However, only a slight majority of\\ncontrollers reported that the MTE was useful for maintaining awareness of IM operations. Since\\nthis information is not available in the TRACON with TSAS, it was added with the granularity\\nreduced to second (from a minute shown in en route). For achieve operations, the difference\\nbetween the TSAS-calculated trail aircraft ETA at the ABP and the lead aircraft ETA at the ABP\\nvalue was shown. For capture operations, the difference between the TSAS-calculated trail\\naircraft ETA at the FAF and the lead aircraft ETA at the FAF value was shown. These values were\\nprovided to allow the controllers to compare the spacing estimated by TBFM / TSAS (ETA\\ndifferential / prediction) to the ASG and to determine how the operation was progressing. After the lead aircraft identification in the lead aircraft field, the sector of the lead aircraft was\\nincluded if both aircraft were not in the same sector (in case coordination between the\\ncontrollers was necessary). The ABP was either DERVL (the merge point) or YOKXO (the FAF and\\nRNP RF turn final approach intercept) (later shown in Figure 3-32). The lead aircraft route was\\nthe IFPI of the lead aircraft. If it was a capture operation, the lead aircraft route was not shown\\nsince it is a requirement that both aircraft be on the same route to conduct",
