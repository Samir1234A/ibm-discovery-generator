MITRE \\noperates seven FFRDCs sponsored by the federal government. These are: National Security Engineering Center sponsored by the Department of Defense, Center for Advanced Aviation System Development sponsored by the Federal \\nAviation Administration, Center for Enterprise Modernization sponsored by the Department of the Treasury \\nand co-sponsored by the Department of Veterans Affairs, CMS Alliance to Modernize Healthcare sponsored by the Centers for Medicare & \\nMedicaid Services, The Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute sponsored \\nby the Department of Homeland Security, Judiciary Engineering and Modernization Center sponsored by the Administrative \\nOffice of the U.S. Courts, and National Cybersecurity Federally Funded Research and Development Center \\nsponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. MITRE also maintains a broad, independent research program, designed to explore \\nemerging issues and potential solutions to benefit our government sponsors, industry and \\nthe public. In conducting this independent study, MITRE interviewed representatives of a number of \\nfederal agencies and federal oversight and accountability organizations. A complete list is \\nshown in Appendix A of the report. MITRE wishes to thank all of these organizations for \\ntheir time and contributions to the study. MITRE Study Team Gary Ingber Dr. Shelley Kirkpatrick Gordon Milbourn Bruce Shirk Jon Stehle iv Abstract According to the Office of Management and Budget, the federal government annually makes \\nmore than $3 trillion in payments of all kinds, the great majority of which are proper. \\nHowever, in fiscal year 2016, federal agencies estimated that they made more than $144 \\nbillion in improper payments (nearly 4.7 percent of all payments), representing the \\nequivalent of the fifth largest federal agency. The amount of reported improper payments \\nnearly tripled over the last decade, and these estimates do not include all programs. The MITRE Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation that operates federally funded \\nresearch and development centers on behalf of federal government sponsors, conducted \\nthis independent study of the motivators of federal Payment Integrity1 in conjunction with \\nits charter to help address significant government-wide problems. The study addresses the \\nfollowing issues. What motivates and enables federal agenciesthe organizations as a whole and \\ntheir individual employeesand entities acting on their behalf (for example, states, \\ngrantees) to optimize their ongoing Payment Integrity efforts? What motivates claimantsindividuals and organizations filing benefits claims, tax \\nreturns, commercial invoices, etc.to be accurate and not make errors or commit \\nfraud? This study describes the impact of these issues and recommends 11 actions for broader, \\nmore cross-government approaches to motivating federal agencies, entities acting on their \\nbehalf, and claimants to ensure Payment Integrity. \\n1 Payment Integrity refers to improper payments and the people, processes, and technology that are meant to ensure that \\nthe payments are actually proper. v Executive Summary According to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the federal government \\nannually makes more than $3 trillion in payments of all kinds, the great majority of which \\nare propermade to the right person or entity, for the right reason, at the right time, in the \\nright amount. However, in fiscal year 2016, federal agencies estimated that they made \\nmore than $144 billion in improper payments (nearly 4.7 percent of all payments)an \\namount that has nearly tripled over the last decade, represents the equivalent of the net \\ncost of the fifth largest agency, and is only for about 115 of the hundreds of federal \\nprograms. This level of improper payments is unaffordable and contributes to public \\nconcerns about the stewardship over taxpayer dollars. Numerous requirements call on \\nagencies to estimate, report on and mitigate improper payments, and we acknowledge the \\nconsiderable efforts ongoing at OMB and across federal agencies to address the challenge. The MITRE Corporation (MITRE), a not-for-profit organization that operates federally \\nfunded research and development centers on behalf of federal government sponsors, \\nrecognizes the impact of the overall Payment Integrity2 situation. Given the public interest \\nnature of the challenge, MITRE conducted this independent study as a follow-on to its \\nFebruary 2016 report.3 MITRE interviewed officials at 9 agencies and 4 oversight and \\naccountability organizations; reviewed extensive academic literature and domestic and \\ninternational applied literature and research; and assessed this information in the context \\nof motivators specific to Payment Integrity. Agencies are often faced with complex legal and regulatory environments, insufficient \\nresources, limited data, and tight timeframes in which to make decisions about payment \\nvalidity and accuracy. Frequently, agencies have competing priorities to issue payments \\ntimely to those who deserve them vs. applying the time and resources to ensure their \\naccuracy. As a result, agencies are often forced to make trade-offs between their \\nresponsibilities to serve the public and to assure the integrity of the payment process. This \\nstudy focuses on a key issue impacting ongoing efforts and the implementation of \\nrecommendations made in MITREs 2016 reportwhat motivates federal agencies, those \\nacting on their behalf (for example, states), and claimants to optimize their ongoing \\nPayment Integrity efforts? Motivating Agencies and Those Acting on Their Behalf \\nMotivating agencies, their employees, and entities acting on their behalf is one important \\nfactor that contributes to program performance in general. In the case of Payment \\nIntegrity, applied literature and research regarding the systems view of organizations \\nindicated that all components of an organizational system should be aligned and \\nfunctioning properly to create the conditions needed for reducing improper payments. \\n2 Payment Integrity refers to improper payments and the people, processes, and technology that are meant to ensure that \\nthe payments are actually proper. \\n3 GOVERNMENT-WIDE PAYMENT INTEGRITY: NEW APPROACHES AND SOLUTIONS NEEDED (MTR160040, February \\n2016) vi Based on interviews with officials from agencies and accountability organizations, we \\nfound that visibility and accountability are motivating, especially external visibility from \\nthe public release of improper payments information; oversight by Congress and other \\nstakeholders; and techniques as naming and shaming. Statutes that mandate certain \\ntypes of program design, that place restrictions on Payment Integrity defenses such as data \\nmatching, or that restrict how states can spend funds on Payment Integrity activities, can \\nadversely impact motivation levels, as can limits on funds for Payment Integrity activities. Some agency officials stated that publishing goals addressing improper payments, coupled \\nwith the required reduction targets, is motivating; a Cross-Agency Priority Goal would \\nquite likely be of help, as well. MITREs February 2016 study report, as well as applied \\nliterature and research, pointed out that agencies need to more closely balance the priority \\non mission (for example, maximizing participation in benefits programs) with \\nmanagement (for example, making accurate payments) in order to emphasize proper \\nstewardship over federal funds. Further, benefits paying programs can be motivated to \\nimprove delivery quality if performance metrics include accuracy of the original payments \\nand if managers are rewarded for quality. Accountability officials and applied literature and research discussed the importance of \\nsenior leaders having the will to address improper payments, regularly communicating the \\nimportance of addressing them throughout government, and holding themselves and \\nothers accountableestablishing a tone at the top to put attention on the issue and keep \\nit there. Agency officials further observed that it is important to address Payment Integrity \\nacross the entire organization, share accountability, and adopt an acting as one approach \\nacross the organization to enhance coordination and decision-making for results. Agency and accountability officials believed that the degree of concern about Payment \\nIntegrity varies across government, with some officials saying that most leaders and staff \\ncare genuinely and others believing these pockets of caring need to be a government-\\nwide culture that starts at the very top and extends through the agencies to states, \\ngrantees, and others. Leaders must set the expectation of and norms for a workplace where \\nall employees work together constructively to ensure Payment Integrity. Various officials, along with applied literature and research, emphasized that managers and \\nstaff also need to be accountable. Some agencies include Payment Integrity in performance \\nstandards at all levels, while others have indirect linkages between the standards and \\norganizational improper payment goals. These goals need to be balanced with, not in \\nconflict with, program goals. For some issues, cross-government approaches might \\nmotivate agencies towards better solutions; decentralized approaches can generate ad hoc, \\nagency-specific solutions for what are actually common issues such as identity. Based on interviews with agency officials and review of academic research, applied \\nliterature and research, we concluded that effectively motivating individual employees",
