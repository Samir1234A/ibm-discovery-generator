Distribution Unlimited. Case No. 18-0717. | # | \\n \\nWelcome to today's presentation. My name is \\nWith so many interesting presentations and exhibits going on right now I really appreciate your interest in exploring an emerging area of using advanced analytics to gain insight from large data sets to make informed decisions that ultimately lead to better health outcomes for our Nation. In today's talk we will talk about a tool that was developed in collaboration between MITRE and Academia (the University of Vermont) that measures happiness and how it has been and can be extended further to predict mental health outcomes in the general population and the Veteran community.\\n1 Discussion Overview\\nIntroduction:\\nThe Hedonometer is an instrument to remotely-sense emotional states and levels, in real time or post hoc. \\nThe Hedonometer provides an analytical platform to perform large-scale, sentiment analysis on many corpora in 10 global languages. \\nDevelopment:\\nThe Hedonometer arose from a longstanding collaboration between the Computational StoryLab at the University of Vermont (UVM) and The MITRE Corporation.\\nAdvancement: \\nThe team has explored various applications of the Hedonometer as an initial screening tool for detecting mental health outcomes in advance of clinical diagnoses.\\nToday: \\nOur collaborative pursuit: applying the Hedonometer as an initial screening tool to identify those Veterans at greatest risk to attempt suicide. | # | \\n \\nThe happiness measuring tool is called the Hedonometer. I'll conduct a demo Lisa will go over couple extensions of this tool Then I'll go over how it's being used for VA as part of our independent R&D efforts.\\n2 Discover new possibilities Create unexpected opportunities Lead \\nby pioneering together with our sponsors and partners MITRE: Solving Problems for a Safer World \\nOur work connects people and data to change the health market and reinvent the health experience | # | \\n \\nMITRE works in the public interest across finance, health, national security, cyber, aviation, and more to solve problems for a safer world. MITRE only operates FFRDCs currently 7 of them which cover most federal govt agencies. Federally funded research and development centers play an important role in working with government and industry to deliver game-changing solutions to complex challenges. FFRDCs must:\\nMeet a \\\"special long-term research and development need\\\" that cannot be met by in-house staff or traditional contractor resources. \\n\\\"Operate in the public interest with objectivity and independence\\\" and \\\"be free from organizational conflicts of interest.\\\"\\nReceive access to sensitive and proprietary data \\\"beyond that which is common to the normal contractual relationship.\\\" This ensures that sponsoring organizations receive fully informed guidance that reflects an understanding of all critical points of view.\\nForm channels of expertise from multiple sources to advance government missions. These characteristics enable FFRDCs to act as long-term strategic partners with the government in such areas as:\\nSystems engineering and integration\\nResearch and development\\nStudy and analysis FFRDCs are an especially valuable resource when an agency confronts a challenge for which there is no obvious solution or a situation in which there are many viable solutions. In these cases, and independent analysis is required to determine which choice offers the agency the greatest benefits in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and affordability. 3 Sponsor Engagement Data is the next level of innovation in health Mission-driven Objective insight Unique vantage point Technical know-how Pioneering together We believe in the power of partnership and trusted engagement to solve our nations toughest health problems, for a safer world. | # | \\n \\nData is the new frontier. Using data in meaningful ways to drive mission success is MITREs strength and passion. Our work connects people and data to change the health market and reinvent the health experience. As Eric Schmidt said in his opening key note, data and information will drive the next wave of innovations through use of AI, machine learning, and predictive analytics to gain valuable insight so humans can make informed decisions. Like augmented reality, AI will augment human intelligence.\\n4 MITRE Partners with Academia to Discover Novel Way to Measure Public Sentiment\\nMITRE invests in partnership with University of Vermont (UVM) Resulting in the development of the Hedonometer\\nAnalytical tool to perform large-scale sentiment analysis of social media content Extensions of Hedonometer to improve health outcomes for veterans\\nEarly warning of emerging mental health issues like depression and PTSD\\nVeteran-ometer Application of Hedonometer specifically tuned for veterans | # | \\n \\nThe Hedonometer was jointly developed in partnership with the University of Vermont. The experts at MITRE is Matt McMahon and Brian Tivnan. The tool in essence is a large-scale sentiment analysis of social media content. This can then be extended to measure a signal (MITREs roots lie in signal detection and processing radar, GPS, etc..). This signal can be detected and measured to determine an early warning system for mental health issues like depression and PTSD and help improve suicide prevention. We use a simple, fast method for measuring the happiness of texts that hinges on two key components: (1) human evaluations of the happiness of a set of individual words, and (2) a naive algorithm for scaling up from individual words to texts. we first use a pattern-matching script to extract the frequency of individual words in a given text. We then compute the weighted average level of happiness for the text neutral words averaging around 5\\n5 www.Hedonometer.org | # | \\n \\nIdeally, we open a browser here and navigate to the site: www.Hedonometer.org so we can explore some of the dynamics rather than rely on static image Expand and shift time window\\nClick on an event walk through components\\nWalk through tabs\\nProjects\\nWords Google Mechanical Turk (Mturk)\\nPress\\nPapers What we do: we look at the sentiment of populations, by applying the hedonometer algorithm to all tweets and then computing average happiness along with word shifts which explain changes in happiness over time. What we dont do: we cant legally filter and examine individual peoples tweets. So, for example we can look at all tweets that mention veterans, and examine the effect of public announcements by the VA on sentiment and word usage, but we cannot look at all tweets by an individual. 6 Hedonometer has been extensively vetted Additional Applications\\nPattern of Life\\nGeography of Happiness\\nLexicocalorimeter\\nScientific Rigor of Hedonometer | # | \\n 7 References: Scientific Foundation of Hedonometer\\nSeveral examples of peer-reviewed publications in top-tier, scientific journals Extension of Hedonometer beyond English to 10 global languages \\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Human language reveals a universal positivity bias.

The goal here is to build technology that identifies early warning signs of mental health problems, and connects individuals to a doctor sooner.\\n8 Predicting Depression from Instagram | # | \\n \\nAbstract: Using Instagram data from 166 individuals, we applied machine learning tools to successfully identify markers of depression. Statistical features were computationally extracted from 43,950 participant Instagram photos, using color analysis, metadata components, and algorithmic face detection. Resulting models outperformed general practitioners average unassisted diagnostic success rate for depression. These results held even when the analysis was restricted to posts made before depressed individuals were first diagnosed. Human ratings of photo attributes (happy, sad, etc.) were weaker predictors of depression, and were uncorrelated with computationally-generated features. These results suggest new avenues for early screening and detection of mental illness. We also employed a suite of supervised machine learning algorithms to estimate the predictive capacity of our models. We report prediction results only from the best-performing algorithm, a 100-tree Random Forests classifier. Depressed individuals in the study tended to post photos that were, on average, bluer, darker, & grayer than those posted by healthy individuals. Their photos also tended to have less faces than those posted by healthy participants. These markers are evident in the Instagram feeds of two UVM students (who did not participate in the study but agreed to provide their Instagram data for the purpose of raising awareness to mental health issues)",
