Case Number 18-0058 Virginia Tech Students Get a Bird's Eye View of MITRE\\nWhen you gather a flock of Hokies at a MITRE lab, the questions fly: \\\"Wow, there are definitely a few more levers in here than in a car,\\\" said one student as she took a seat in the cockpit simulator in the Center for Advanced Aviation System Development's Integration Demonstration and Experimentation for Aeronautics Lab. \\\"Are many employees former pilots or air traffic controllers?\\\" \\\"Do you worry about your technology getting into the wrong hands?\\\" asked one student during the autonomous robotics presentation. \\\"Whats the next big social event coming up?\\\" asked another. On August 15th and on January 9th, engineering students from Virginia Tech (whose school mascot is a bird called a Hokie) toured several labs at MITRE's McLean, Virginia campus. The students represented majors across different aspects of engineeringfrom data analytics to industrial and systems engineering, to computer engineering. Each rising senior met with a hiring manager, in between lab tours and presentations about the breadth and depth of MITRE's work. The studentsall DC metro area residentstook advantage of their time away from their college campuses to visit MITRE and get a head start on career opportunities ahead of graduation. The group learned about ongoing research and development in robotics, aviation safety, securing the Internet of Things, simulation experiments, and more. Putting MITRE on the Upcoming Graduates' Radar No matter how many questions the students asked, they got answersthanks to diverse participation across the company. In addition to R&D presentations, MITRE's DeAnthony Heart and Keith H. Miller gave a talk about NextUp, the companys early-career affinity group. They shared with the students the variety of career development opportunities (including mentoring) and social and community service options available at MITRE. \\\"These students will be considering full time employment in May 2018,\\\" says MITRE's Steve Roe, a Virginia Tech alumnusone of many at the company. \\\"Our goal is to put MITRE on their radar as they consider their career path post-graduation.\\\" In other words, as these students found, it's never too early to spread your wings and scope out the landscape of an exciting career.
