  "text": "Caution Alert was triggered and the aircraft \\nexceeded the CSL on a three-mile final. Exactly 15 seconds after the Caution Alert was displayed, \\nthe aircraft exceeded the CSL, as shown in Figure 5-9. The controller then terminated IM PA \\napproximately two seconds later and issued the break out. Figure 5-9. IM PA Day 3 Alert Timing Scenario Separation Violation Although a situation like this was only observed to occur once across all of the evaluated \\nscenarios, it supports comments and feedback from several controllers that they would like the \\nability to try to manually provide speed assignments to aircraft that were at risk of encroaching \\non a safety limit. It is notable that every observed instance of a safety limit exceedance, \\nwhether or not it resulted in an IM PA separation violation, occurred with the shortest alert \\ntiming values. Therefore, if a PA separation standard would allow controllers to manually \\nmanage Trail Aircraft speeds, further alert timing research is recommended to examine values \\nthat would ensure interventions can be successfully implemented before a safety limit is \\nexceeded. Between Pair Separation Violations The Day 1-2 Nominal and Day 3 Alert Timing scenarios were also examined to determine if any \\nseparation violations occurred between aircraft that were being separated with MRS or RECAT \\nminima. Twelve total instances were observed; the circumstances are shown in Table 5-10. \\nThese instances had many similar or identical circumstances and so they were then categorized \\ninto five unique cases for analysis and discussion. In the table, Nom is short for Nominal, AT is \\nshort for Alert Timing, Comb is short for Combined, and Sep is short for Separate. An MRS value \\nof 2.5 NM within 10 NM of the runway was used in the analysis as the participants were trained \\nthat they could allow that level of compression. xvii\\n Table 5-10.

Case A. Of the ten Nominal scenario occurrences, seven involved the same aircraft pairing \\nunder nearly identical circumstances. As a B772 aircraft (Category B) on 28L (UAL905) \\napproached the runway threshold, the A320 aircraft (Category D) behind it on the parallel \\nrunway (UAL136) continued to compress. Based on the Wake RECAT standards used in the HITL \\n(Table 4-1), 5 NM was the required separation. However just before the B772 crossed the \\nthreshold, the spacing reduced to between 4.8 to 4.9 NM, which at SFO is considered a \\ncompression error. As shown in Figure 5-10, one controller used the STARS range tool to xviii\\n 12 Controller video capture was not available for one of the runs and so the other circumstances at the time of this violation \\nwere not able to be assessed. monitor this pair; however, still elected not to intervene. Figure 5-10. Case A: Example Separation Violation Between UPS905 and UAL136 At the time this occurred, one to two other IM PA alerting events were happening \\nsimultaneously in the scenario. In at least four12 cases, UAL136 was experiencing a Predictive \\nAlert as shown in Figure 5-10. In those same four cases, plus at least two more, an aircraft that \\njust joined the 28R approach experienced a Caution Alert as shown in Figure 5-27. It is possible, \\neven likely, that the controller participants were aware of the compression error occurring \\nbetween these two aircraft. However, they may have determined that the safest course of \\naction was to prioritize their attention with the IM PA issues occurring at the same time and let \\nthe aircraft proceed to landing. Case B. This situation occurred in one of the Case A scenarios and involved one of the same \\ncontrollers. This time, however, the separation violation occurred between the leading B772 \\n(UAL905) and the trailing B763 (UAL951) arriving to the same runway as shown in Figure 5-11. \\nBased on the Wake RECAT standards used in the HITL (Table 4-1), 4 NM between these aircraft \\nwere required. The aircraft compressed to approximately 3.5 NM at the time UAL905 crossed \\nthe threshold, as shown in Figure 5-12. At the time of this violation, there was no Predictive \\nAlert for UAL136 and no Caution Alert (yet) for the aircraft joining the 28R Approach forward of \\nthe CSL. Figure 5-11. Case B: Separation Violation Between UPS905 and UAL951 at the Time of Occurrence xix\\n Figure 5-12. Case B: Minimum Observed Separation Between UPS905 and UAL951 Case C. This situation involved a B763 (UAL723, Category C) compressing to less than 2.5 NM \\nbehind an A320 (JBU231, Category D) arriving to the parallel runway. Due to the weight \\ncategories involved (C following D), 2.5 NM MRS was required. The situation at the time of the \\nviolation is shown in Figure 5-13. As this was an All Tools Off scenario, this particular controller \\nfound that placing a 1.5 NM ring around each Heavy IM Lead Aircraft helped keep track of \\npairings in which a WSL would eventually become active. Figure 5-13. Case C: Separation Violation Between JBU231 and UAL723 at the Time of Occurrence As shown in Figure 5-14, the two aircraft compressed to approximately 2.25 NM at the time \\nUAL905 crossed the threshold. No other scenario alerts were observed to have occurred during \\nthis event. Figure 5-14. Case C: Minimum Observed Separation Between JBU231 and UAL723 Case D. This was the only case to involve the Separate Controller configuration. Here, a \\nseparation violation occurred between a leading B772 and a trailing B737 arriving to the same \\nrunway. Based on the Wake RECAT standards used in the HITL (Table 4-1), 5 NM were required \\nbetween the two aircraft. From the aircraft state data, they compressed to 4.4 NM at their \\nclosest point. A simulation error in the recording of the controller display for this scenario xx\\n precluded further assessment. Case E. The two occurrences observed for the Alert Timing scenarios involved the same aircraft \\npairing under similar circumstances. A B763 (DAL811, Category C) compressed to less than 2.5 \\nNM behind an A320 (JBU432, Category D) arriving to the parallel runway. Due to the weight \\ncategories involved (C following D), 2.5 NM MRS was required. The situation at the time of \\nviolation occurrence 11 (as listed in Table 5-10) is shown in Figure 5-15. The situation at the \\ntime of violation occurrence 12 is shown in Figure 5-16. Figure 5-15. Case E, Occurrence 11: Separation Violation Between JBU432 and DAL811 at the Time of \\nOccurrence Figure 5-16. Case E, Occurrence 12: Separation Violation Between JBU432 and DAL811 at the Time of \\nOccurrence The only difference between the two Case E scenarios was the alert timing values and that a \\nPredictive Alert was displayed for occurrence 12 as it had the smaller value. However, this may \\nnot have been a primary distraction as this violation was also observed in occurrence 11, where \\nthere was no Predictive Alert for this pairing at the time of the occurrence (though it came a few \\nseconds later). The situation was further complicated as JBU432 then experienced a WSL \\nCaution Alert. The alert happened 18 seconds after the separation violation for occurrence 11 \\n(Figure 5-17), and 11 seconds after the separation violation for occurrence 12 (Figure 5-18). \\nControllers in both situations then terminated IM PA for JBU432. In both cases, the distance \\nbetween the two aircraft at the time of the JBU432 Caution Alert was just over 2 NM. xxi\\n Figure 5-17. Case E, Occurrence 11: Separation Between JBU432 and DAL811 at the Time of the JBU432 \\nCaution Alert Figure 5-18. Case E, Occurrence 12: Separation Between JBU432 and DAL811 at the Time of the JBU432 \\nCaution Alert In summary, twelve total separation violations were observed across the evaluated runs. They",
