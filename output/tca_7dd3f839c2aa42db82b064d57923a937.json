Such testing should simulate the complexity of real-world clinical data, clinical workflow, and human interaction with health IT applications. [1: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/hitech-act-enforcement-interim-final-rule/index.html, Accessed 04/02/2019] To address this critical and growing need, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is proposing the development of a marketplace connecting test originators and test executors, notionally called a National Test Collaborative (NTC) for health IT. CDC envisions that test originators (e.g., federal agencies, researchers, providers, health IT developers) would define health IT testing needs, specify the parameters for testing (e.g., test types, clinical setting options, patient cohorts), and then share this information with potential test executors (e.g., electronic health record and other health IT developers, clinical providers, public health departments). Incentivized test executors would agree to conduct the testing in their local environments according to pre-specified parameters and share the results of the tests with the originator. Once this model for real-world testing is established, it could be used any time a new health IT application needs to be tested in real-world settings. \\nTo ensure success, careful thought should be given to the challenges faced in prior efforts. Broad engagement of stakeholders and a phased approach that incorporates lessons learned will be essential to success. Main body of paper (4000 words)\\nIntroduction\\nBackground\\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009 incentivized clinical providers to adopt health information technology (IT) such as electronic health records (EHRs), and it promoted the use of health IT to improve the quality of clinical care.[endnoteRef:1] These investments have led to important increases in health IT adoption and use.[endnoteRef:2] However, as the demands on EHRs grow (e.g., reporting of electronic clinical quality measures [eCQMs] by clinical providers, addition of clinical decision support [CDS] tools to EHRs, and data extraction from EHRs for public health and research), there is a critical need for real-world clinical testing of health IT applications.

Jha, HITECH Act Drove Large Gains In Hospital Electronic Health Record Adoption, Health Aff (Millwood), vol. 36, no. 8, pp. 1416-1422, Aug 1, 2017.] Indeed, the 21st Century Cures Act[endnoteRef:3] mandates acceleration in developing new health IT products to stimulate health information exchange. To that end, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) is engaged in a process with industry to develop the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA).[endnoteRef:4] This framework, which has invited numerous rounds of public comment,[endnoteRef:5] proposes to increase the exchange of health information by developing a common agreement to be used among diverse stakeholders. TEFCA has three high-level goals (1) provide a single on-ramp to nationwide connectivity, (2) enable electronic health information to securely follow the patient where needed, and (3) support nationwide scalability.4,[endnoteRef:6],[endnoteRef:7] Successful adoption and implementation of TEFCA would address some of the challenges encountered to date with trust and interoperable data exchange between health IT systems.

[Accessed 5 May 2019].] Testing health IT capabilities is an important step toward advancing interoperability. Currently, there are a variety of environments for testing some aspects of interoperability and functionality of health IT applications using synthetic data. Examples of these test environment sandboxes include the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) BlueButton Sandbox,[endnoteRef:8] AEGIS Touchstone,[endnoteRef:9] Cypress,[endnoteRef:10] the National Quality Forum (NQF) Measure Incubator,[endnoteRef:11] the SMART Platform,[endnoteRef:12] Inferno,[endnoteRef:13] and sandboxes hosted by Logica Health[endnoteRef:14] and the CDCs Public Health Informatics Research Lab.[endnoteRef:15] While synthetic data sandboxes provide an opportunity to test some aspects of functionality, they do not adequately reflect real-world clinical workflows or human interaction with health IT applications, which are often difficult to simulate.[endnoteRef:16] Several analyses have shown that even with up-front synthetic testing, real-world implementation of systems can result in unanticipated challenges to true interoperability.[endnoteRef:17], [endnoteRef:18], [endnoteRef:19] [8: CMS, Blue Button 2.0: Improving Medicare Beneficiary Access to Their Health Information, [Online].

Singh, An analysis of electronic health record-related patient safety concerns, J Am Med Inform Assoc, vol. 21, no. 6, pp. 1053-9, Nov-Dec 2014.] The need for better capabilities for testing health IT applications in EHRs using real-world clinical data, clinical team members, and clinical workflows is reflected in the 21st Century Cures Act and detailed in a rule proposed by ONC in early 2019. This rule included, among other requirements, the need for health IT products to be tested in the real world in order to maintain ONC certification.[endnoteRef:20] Such efforts to test health IT using real-world clinical data will help application errors to be detected earlier in the development process (i.e., fail early) and for usability to be more adequately incorporated into testing efforts. Increasing clinician usability should lead to faster implementation of these health IT applications into clinical environments and ultimately could reduce clinician burden and improve clinician productivity. [20: ONC, 21st Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program, [Online]. Available: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2019-03-04/pdf/2019-02224.pdf. [Accessed 15 May 2019]. ] There have been at least two attempts by CMS to develop a real-world testing environment for eCQMs, which were based upon the voluntary participation of clinical providers and EHR and other health IT developers. Unfortunately, these attempts were not fully implemented in part, due to insufficient early stakeholder engagement and lack of consensus among stakeholders; the associated time requirements and opportunity costs for participants; the challenges associated with legal and technical aspects of privacy, security, and data sharing; and lack of development of a sustainable business model early in the development and implementation phases. Another ongoing, relevant effort, although not exclusively for testing health IT applications, is the Accelerating Change and Transformation in Organization and Networks (ACTION) Network, spearheaded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).[endnoteRef:21] This network is a U.S. government-contracting mechanism (infinite delivery/infinite quantity [IDIQ]) that is successfully bringing together pre-selected organizations to bid on federal proposals to answer healthcare research questions using real-world clinical data.[endnoteRef:22] Another effort in the private sector is NODE.Health, a network that brings together clinical providers/EHR and other health IT developers with those needing to test their new digital technologies.[endnoteRef:23] While these latter two networks are not currently testing health IT, they offer a model that could be replicated for testing health IT. For example, if the next iteration of the ACTION Network (i.e., ACTION IV) included health IT testing, this mechanism could be leveraged by federal agencies to fulfill the functions of a national test collaborative.
