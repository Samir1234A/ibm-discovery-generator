  "text": "    \"text\": \" Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 18-2490 Meet the MITRE Summer Interns at the NCCoE, Class of 2018! Some of MITREs summer interns took a break from their work for the National Cybersecurity \\nFFRDC (NCF) to strike a pose for their class photo. As the nations first and only cybersecurity \\nFederally Funded Research and Development Center, the NCF works across government and \\nindustry to solve cybersecurity challenges that pose a serious risk to national security, public \\nsafety, and economic prosperity. The interns are based at the NCFs principal work program, \\nthe National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) in Rockville, Maryland, which is \\nsponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). While some of the students are local, others hail from towns and cities from across the \\ncountrysome from as far away as Florida, Mississippi, New York, and Illinois. All are pursuing \\ngraduate and undergraduate degrees, enabling them to work alongside MITRE and NIST \\nprofessional staff on a variety of challenging projects for the NCCoE, including Mitigating \\nInternet of Things-Based Distributed Denial of Service attacks, Multifactor Authentication for e-\\nCommerce, and mobile device security. This fall, most of the students will return to their respective campuses, while others will stay on \\nat the NCCoE to continue work on their projects.
