I invite you to read more about MITREs research and work in this ecosystem and our crucial role as an innovation bridge. Sincerely, Alfred Grasso, President\\nand Chief Executive Officer\\nThe MITRE Corporation Ours Is a \\nHigher Ambition Our Vision\\nTo create a stronger nation and a better world by contributing to breakthroughs in safety and security. Our Mission\\nOne public-interest company, working with industry and academia to advance and apply science, technology, systems engineering, and strategy, enabling government and the private sector to make better decisions and implement solutions to complex challenges of national and global significance.

A challenge in one country now presents a challenge for the world. In \\ncyberspace, on the battlefield, in hospitals, cities, courts, financial systems, in the air and beyond, we are truly a global ecosystem. MITRE is uniquely qualified to meet the challenges of todays world. With our own ecosystem of seven federally funded research and development centers, we are able to look across the federal government and the globe to the benefit of all of our sponsors. We serve as an innovation bridgeconnecting sponsors to sponsors, solutions to problems, technology to industry, and partners to opportunities. This year our sponsors celebrated a number of significant accomplishments. Whether safeguarding the United States from missile debris, protecting our assets in physical space and cyberspace, empowering patients and veterans, increasing the speed of justice and the economy, or ensuring safe and secure air travel, MITRE was instrumental in helping our sponsors achieve mission success. Our Innovation Program is the cornerstone of these successes, and we continue to break new ground as we seek to solve the problems of tomorrow today. This years MITRE Challenge of Countering Unauthorized Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) brought participants from around the world, and weve just recently launched our second challenge on the Unique Identification of Internet of Things Devices. This year also marked change within our organization: our Board named Dr. John Hamre, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense, to serve as Chairman. John has served on the Board since 2000, and he has brought to MITRE a remarkable understanding of national security issues at the highest levels. MITRE will be well served by his deep knowledge and experience. John succeeds The Honorable Charles Robb, who is retiring after 15 years with MITREservice that came after a distinguished political career of more than a quarter century. We will miss his wisdom and guidance and are grateful for his service. Finally, we were pleased to open the doors to our newest McLean campus building in 2016. MITRE 4 is a modern, green facility with cutting-edge laboratories and collaborative spaces for employees and guests. In the pages ahead, we take a closer look at the challenges of 2016 and beyond and our contributions to our sponsors and international partners successes within this global ecosystem in which we work. Regards, 5T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n We Operate \\nFFRDCs MITRE manages a powerful ecosystem of federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) for multiple U.S. government sponsors to solve global challenges.
