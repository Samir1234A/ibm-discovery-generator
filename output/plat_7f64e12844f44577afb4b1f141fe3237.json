  "text": "\\nacquirers, integrators, and suppliers that begins with the design of ICT \\nproducts and services and extends through development, sourcing, \\nmanufacturing, handling, and delivery of ICT products and services to the \\nacquirer. Proper vetting and personnel authentication strategies should be in place for all \\nentities involved in the ICS development lifecycle | 55 | User Access Controls Performing the authentication and authorization of users in the ICS \\nenvironment presents a challenge. Managing these users accounts can be \\nproblematic as employees are added, removed, and as their roles change Authentication and authorization can be performed either in a distributed or \\ncentralized approach using Kerberos, RADIUS, TACACS+ Distributed Approach: Every system performs these steps on their own. Each system is \\nresponsible for storing its own set of user accounts, credentials, and roles \\nand performing the identification and authentication of the user. Centralized Approach Utilizes some central authentication system (e.g., Microsoft Active Directory, \\nLightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to store all accounts and \\nmanage the authentication and authorization of all individuals and systems. | 56 | Intrusion Detection and Response Intrusion detection and response is a defensive resilience strategy set to \\nensure ICS equipment and HMIs are operable during and after cyber-enabled \\nattacks This strategy enforces ICS incident response teams and analyst to automate \\nresponse and remediation techniques per cyber attack The strategy encompasses: Detect identify the presence of an abnormal event Mitigate after successful attack, control infected system and return back to \\nnormal state Learn learn from successful attack, and automate prevention strategies | 57 | Lessons Learned\\nPart I Since ICS environments encompass various entities, proper asset \\nmanagement should be considered ICS devices and networks should not be installed on the organizations \\ncorporate network Security controls may involve aspects of policy, oversight, supervision, \\nmanual processes, actions by individuals, or automated mechanisms \\nimplemented by information systems/devices Monitoring on a real-time basis where feasible is a great factor for \\nincident response, analysis, and knowing the health state of the ICS \\nenvironment Firewall and network configuration rules should be in place and \\nconsistently maintained and monitored | 58 | Lessons Learned\\nPart II All remote machines used to connect to the ICS devices should be \\nhardened to support the Defensive-in-Depth strategy Supply chain attacks are impactful and all personnel involved in the ICS \\ndevelopment lifecycle should be authenticated and verified Authentication and authorization can be performed either in a distributed \\nor centralized approach Intrusion detection and response is a defensive resilience strategy set to \\nensure ICS equipment and HMIs are operable during and after cyber-\\nenabled attacks | 59 | Assessing Risks to ICS | 60 | Assessing Risks to ICS\\nPart I Organizations need to manage: Financial risk, risk of equipment failure, personnel safety risk, etc. Safety assessments are well established Risk Management NIST Special Publication 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: \\nOrganization, Mission and Information System View NIST Special Publication 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk \\nManagement Framework to Federal Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach | 61 | Assessing Risks to ICS\\nPart II National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST Special Publication 800-82, source URL: \\nhttps://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-82r2.pdf https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-82r2.pdf | 62 | Assessing Risks to ICS\\nPart III Framing Developing a framework for the risk management decisions to \\nbe made Safety How do safety requirements interact with information security How conflicts between safety requirements good security practice reconciled Availability of services ICS part of critical infrastructure where continuous and reliable operations is \\na requirement ICS with strict requirements for availability or for recovery Physical operating environment Specific environmental requirements ICS tied to their physical environment | 63 | Assessing Risks to ICS\\nPart IV Assessing risk Identify threats and vulnerabilities that are likely to cause \\nharm if an adverse event arising from them occurs ICS-CERT Sharing of device vulnerabilities, incidents, and mitigation \\nmeasure. Information sharing organizations Responding Consistent organizational-wide response to identification \\nof risk Risk responses may be constrained in ICS by system requirements, \\npotential adverse impact on operations, or regulatory compliance regimes Monitoring Monitor risk on an on-going basis Implement a risk management strategy Monitor changes in the environment that may affect risk calculations Monitor the effectiveness and efficiency of risk reduction activities\\n | 64 | ICS Considerations\\nPart I Safety Information security risk assessment must identify and communicate \\nidentified risks that could have safety implications and vice versa. Potential Physical Impacts An evaluation of the potential physical impacts should include all parts of an \\nICS, beginning with evaluating the potential impacts on the set of sensor and \\nactuators. Physical Disruption Potential effects to the physical process performed by the ICS under \\nconsideration, as well as other systems Cascading impacts into other related ICS processes should be considered \\nas well | 65 | ICS Considerations\\nPart II Non-digital Aspects ICS often have non-digital control mechanisms that can prevent the ICS \\nfrom operating outside of a safe boundary Analog mechanisms can be used to observe the physical system state to \\nprovide operators with reliable data if digital readings are unavailable or \\ncorrupted Safety Systems Impact of the implemented security controls on the safety system should be \\nevaluated to determine that they do not negatively impact the system Impact to Connected Systems ICS may be interconnected with other systems, such that failures in one \\nsystem or process can easily cascade to other systems either within or \\nexternal to the organization | 66 | Risk Management Framework Tasks National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST Special Publication 800-82, source URL: \\nhttps://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-82r2.pdf https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-82r2.pdf | 67 | Simple Example The SCADA system contains both real-time sensor data and routine \\nadministrative information. The management at the power plant \\ndetermines that SC sensor data = {(confidentiality, NA), (integrity, HIGH), (availability, \\nHIGH)}, SC administrative information = {(confidentiality, LOW), (integrity, LOW), \\n(availability, LOW)}. SC SCADA system = {(confidentiality, LOW), (integrity, HIGH), (availability, \\nHIGH)} Considering the potential impact of a security breach due to the \\nunauthorized disclosure of system-level information or processing \\nfunctions SC SCADA system = {(confidentiality, MODERATE), (integrity, HIGH), \\n(availability, HIGH)} | 68 | ICS Impact Levels Product Produced Non-hazardous materials or \\nproducts Non-ingested consumer \\nproducts Some hazardous products \\nor steps during production High amount of proprietary \\ninformation Critical infrastructure (e.g., \\nelectricity) Hazardous materials \\nIngested products Industry Examples Plastic injection molding \\nWarehouse applications Automotive metal \\nindustries Pulp and paper \\nSemiconductors Utilities\\n Petrochemical\\n Food and beverage\\n Pharmaceutical Security Concerns Protection against minor \\ninjuries Ensuring uptime Protection against \\nmoderate injuries Ensuring uptime\\n Capital investment Protection against major \\ninjuries/loss of life Ensuring uptime\\n Capital investment\\n Trade secrets\\n Ensuring basic social services\\n Regulatory compliance National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST Special Publication 800-82, source URL: \\nhttps://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-82r2.pdf https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-82r2.pdf | 69 | Overlays Overlay A fully specified set of security controls, control enhancements, \\nand supplemental guidance derived from the application of tailoring \\nguidance to security control baselines described in NIST SP 800-53. Address the need for developing community-wide and specialized sets of \\nsecurity controls for information systems and organizations | 70 | Key Security Controls\\nPart I Role-based Access Control (RBAC) Legacy ICS systems or specialized ICS equipment may require development \\nof specialized interface software. Web Servers Some products, such as PLCs and other control devices, are available with \\nembedded Web, FTP, and email servers to make them easier to configure \\nremotely and allow them to generate email notifications and reports when \\ncertain conditions occur. Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) VLANs have been effectively deployed in ICS networks, with each \\nautomation cell assigned to a single VLAN to limit unnecessary traffic \\nflooding and allow network devices on the same VLAN to span multiple \\nswitches | 71 | Key Security Controls\\nPart II Wireless Prior to installation, a wireless survey should be performed to determine \\nantenna location and strength to minimize exposure of the wireless network Configuration Management A formal change management program should be established and \\nprocedures used to insure that all modifications to an ICS network meet the \\nsame security requirements Virtual Private Network (VPN) VPN devices used to protect control systems should be thoroughly tested to \\nverify that the VPN technology is compatible with the application | 72 | Key Security Controls\\nPart III Intrusion Detection and Prevention IDS and IPS vendors are beginning to develop and incorporate attack \\nsignatures for various ICS protocols such as Modbus, DNP3, and ICCP An effective IDS deployment typically involves both host-based and network-\\nbased IDS Patch Management Applying patches to OS components creates another situation where \\nsignificant care should be exercised in the ICS environment. Patches should \\nbe adequately tested to determine the acceptability of side effects | 73 | Lesson Learned Organizations need to consider financial, equipment failure, and \\npersonnel safety risks within ICS environments NIST SP 800-37 and 800-39 are great resources to consider for managing \\nrisks Overlays are a fully specified set of security controls, control \\nenhancements, and supplemental guidance derived from the application \\nof tailoring guidance to security control baselines described in NIST SP \\n800-53 Manageable security controls can decrease the security risk within an ICS \\nenvironment | 74 | Cyber Risk Management Framework Exemplar\\nU.S. DOE ONG-C2M2 Overview The Department of Energy (DOE) developed the Oil and Natural Gas \\nSubsector Cybersecurity Capability Maturity",
