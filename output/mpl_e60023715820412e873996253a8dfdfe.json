Users can test if the implementation works properly with the test database.py script. Full instructions are in the README file and this script can be run to UP JORS software Latex paper template version 0.1 perform spot-checks on the sample data and the full database to ensure the import has completed properly. (2) Availability Operating system All operating systems should be compatible. Programming languages MongoDB version 2.6 or higher Python 2.7 Python packages: pymongo, csv, datetime, argparse, codecs, pandas, and subprocess Additional versions could be compatible, these are the verified requirements. Additional system requirements None. Dependencies The data import package in the GitHub repository is necessary for installation. Users need to obtain UNOS STAR files directly from the OPTN. This data contains private health data and can only be obtained through the OPTN via a request. List of contributors Christine Harvey was the lead developer on this project with support from Dr. Robert Weigel.

This tool provides a reproducible, open source alternative to working with the data quickly and efficiently. This allows researchers to use modern machine learning and research tools to analyze data. The software has a high potential for extension. This tool is currently written in Python 2.7 and could be upgraded to Python3. The software could also be extended to use alternative databases. There is no official support for this software, but those with questions or interested in collaboration can contact Christine Harvey at ceharvey@mitre.org or via GitHub. https://github.com/ceharvs/transplant2mongo UP JORS software Latex paper template version 0.1 Acknowledgements The data reported here have been supplied by the United Network for Organ Sharing as the contractor for the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.
