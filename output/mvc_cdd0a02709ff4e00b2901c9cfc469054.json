  "text": "to manage health care costs and improve care coordination across the span of care. The most important distinction between Category 3 and Category 4 payments is that the latter involve a single, predominantly prospective payment that encompasses a broad array of services, whereas providers participating in Category 3 models continue to be paid on a FFS basis with retrospective reconciliation after the period of performance. Additional conditions must be met before a payment model can be placed into Category 4. Specifically, Category 4 payments reflect the (TCOC) for treating a primary (typically chronic) condition (e.g., diabetes or cancer), a more limited set of specialty services (e.g., primary care or behavioral health), or comprehensive care for an entire population. By contrast, payments for a more limited set of services or procedures (e.g., knee and hip replacement) are classified as Category 3, even if they are population-based and patient-centered (e.g., paid for prospectively and include accountability for patient-reported outcomes). For example, a prospective, population-based primary care model would be classified in Category 4A, but a population-based bundled payment for maternity care would be classified as a Category 3B because it only addresses one aspect of a persons care and health. Similarly, population-based clinical episode and bundled payments that are tied to conditions (e.g., diabetes or cancer) fall under Category 4, whereas clinical episode payments tied to procedures (e.g., hip replacement or back surgery) fall under Category 3, even if they are paid prospectively. As such, Category 4 payments are more person-focused, insofar as they include stronger incentives to promote health and wellness throughout the care continuum. Population-Based Payment (Category 4): Payment models classified as Category 4 involve prospective, population-based payments, structured in a manner that encourages providers to deliver well-coordinated, high-quality, person-centered care within either a defined scope of practice (4A), or a comprehensive collection of care (4B), or a highly integrated finance and delivery system (4C). For the same reasons as Category 3, Category 4 APMs require accountability for measures of appropriate care, to provide additional safeguards against incentives to limit necessary care. Absent this accountability, APMs that use prospective, population- based payments will be classified in Category 4N. Payments within Category 4 can be used to cover a wide range of preventive health, care coordination, and wellness services, in addition to standard medical procedures typically paid through claims, and this flexibility makes it easier for providers to invest in foundational and innovative delivery system components. Additionally, replacing the volume-based incentives of FFS with prospective, population- based payments creates stronger incentives for providers to maximize quality within a budget. Taken Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2546. 30 together, these mutually reinforcing characteristics of Category 4 payments both the freedom to practice medicine without having to rearrange care delivery to meet strict reimbursement requirements, and the incentives to maximize the quality and efficiency of care delivery hold special promise for providers and patients who are able and willing to participate in them. Despite the promise of Category 4 APMs, it is important to recognize that it is very difficult to limit providers exposure to insurance risk in these payment arrangements. When designing Category 4 APMs, it is therefore essential to recognize that providers outside of integrated finance and delivery systems are unlikely to have the administrative capabilities or risk-based capital to assume insurance risk. Certain safeguards can be taken to minimize the introduction of insurance risk into population- based payment models. First, these models will need to be carefully risk-adjusted to account for patient case-mix. Second, the models will need to carve out payments for essential yet extraordinarily expensive or random events, which should not be attributed to the accountable provider (e.g., in the case of patients needing a heart transplant soon after they are attributed to a provider organization). Third, stop-loss mechanisms should be put into place, in order to protect providers against unexpected cost increases for warranted care (e.g., the recent entry of expensive but effective pharmaceuticals), as well as other catastrophic, unpredictable events (e.g., epidemics of infectious disease). Category 4 is subdivided into subcategories A, B, and C, as outlined below: Category 4A includes bundled payments for the comprehensive treatment of specific conditions. \\nFor example, bundled payments for cancer care fall under Category 4A if providers are responsible for the total cost and quality of care for a patient, rather than covering, for example, only chemotherapy payments. Additionally, prospective payments are classified in Category 4A if they are prospective and population-based, and also cover all care delivered by particular types of clinicians (e.g., primary care and orthopedics). Payments in Category 4B are prospective and population-based, and they cover all an individuals \\nhealth care needs. Category 4B encompasses a broad range of financing and delivery system arrangements, in which payers and providers are organizationally distinct. Payments in Category 4C also cover comprehensive care, but unlike Category 4B payments, they \\nmove from the financing arm to the delivery arm of the same, highly integrated finance and delivery organization. In some cases, these integrated arrangements consist of insurance companies that own provider networks, while in other cases they consist of delivery systems that offer their own insurance products. To be effective, the finance and delivery arms will need to work in tandem, to ensure that effective delivery investments are being made, and that incentives and strategies within the organization are properly aligned. Additionally, it is important to note that when integrated lines of business comprise a portion of a companys portfolio, only the integrated payments count toward Category 4C. Integrated Finance and Delivery Systems Integrated finance and delivery systems bring together insurance plans and delivery systems within the same organization. These systems may include joint ventures between insurance companies and provider groups, insurance companies that own provider groups, or provider groups that offer insurance products. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2546. 31 Category 4A may be an appropriate endpoint when smaller provider organizations with targeted skill sets deliver patient care that revolves around the management of chronic conditions, such as cancer or heart disease. Nevertheless, in many instances it is preferable to compensate providers for maintaining health and managing illness for an entire population, rather than compartmentalizing and subdividing payments into distinct conditions. Additionally, condition-specific payments should, in time, become part of a comprehensive approach to improving health and reducing costs for an entire population, such that Category 4A arrangements evolve into Category 4B arrangements. Based on interviews with companies involved in integrated finance and delivery arrangements, it appears that Category 4C payments have the potential to carry significant advantages. For example, these arrangements can expedite investments in crucial care delivery infrastructure, such as population health management support, programs to improve care coordination and care transitions, HIT, and community health initiatives. Additionally, highly integrated arrangements can provide important foundations for organizational cultures and strategies directed toward population health management, and they can create stronger alignments between physician groups and hospitals. On the other hand, widespread growth of integrated finance and delivery systems could potentially result in market consolidation, which could in turn lead to decreased choices and lack of access for patients, as well as increased costs. Evidence on the effectiveness of highly integrated systems is still in its early stages, and preliminary results are inconclusive. Therefore, Category 4B and 4C APMs should be considered equally effective vehicles for increasing the value of care through delivery system improvements. Taken together, Categories 4A, 4B, and 4C represent the furthest departure from traditional FFS payments, while simultaneously ensuring that providers possess the strongest possible incentives to deliver high-quality and efficient care. Nevertheless, as discussed above, Category 4 payments are not necessarily appropriate for all providers and markets. To be successful, providers will necessarily travel at different paces and along different trajectories in the collective journey of health payment and delivery reform. But over time, Category 4 APMs will offer an appealing destination for more and more providers and other stakeholders in the health care system. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2546. 32 Conclusion As set forth in this document, transitioning from FFS to population-based payments is critical for health care transformation. Keeping in mind the underlying principles, the APM Framework provides a high-level mapping of payment approaches, as well as a pathway for payment reform and a foundation for measuring progress. These tools should be useful for all stakeholders and prove enduring as they navigate the health care ecosystem. Although the Framework identifies and encompasses all models of payment reform, new developments in the health care sector may result in a need for further refinement in future years. Nevertheless, the Framework should be robust enough to accommodate foreseeable changes and become the overarching framework for discussing and evaluating payments in the U.S. health care system. The LAN intends to continue compiling and periodically releasing case studies of payment models. (See APM Framework White Paper Addendum.) This is important because it will disseminate lessons learned and provide the nation with models to consider as public and private plans align around common payment",
