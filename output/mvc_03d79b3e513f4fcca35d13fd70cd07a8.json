Accuracy of Estimated Range Table 6 shows the percentage of actual flight intersection falling in the projected range in \\nthe 365 projections made for the year 2016. Table 6.

Please note that this is effectively a sensitivity study future study is to evaluate the \\nsensitivity of model performance to variations in constraint parameters. The test areas of \\nairspace are approximately 200 NM in span and oriented perpendicular to the direction of \\ntraffic. Projection of blocking airspaces of different size, shapes, and locations may produce \\ndifferent results. Another variable is the activation time; changing it from the current value \\nof two hours may result in different performance of the model. VII. Implementation An important goal of this research is to explore the feasibility of the model in providing \\ninstantaneous impact assessment of arbitrarily defined airspace using a what-if analysis \\nparadigm. To accomplish that, the projections were generated and encoded in advance in a \\npreprocessing step, and a graphical user interface was developed to test the ability of the \\nmodel to support what-if analysis. Preprocessing to Generate and Encode Projections The model required multiphase processing of daily flight tracks spanning five years and \\ngenerating the resulting Route Segment Density maps. Steps such as inferring flown flight \\nplans (see Section V) are very compute-intensive, as they require geo-spatial queries over a \\nlarge database of nodes to align flight plan path to flown path. The team used a massively \\nparallel high-performance computing cluster with 896 nodes and 1 TB of disk to process \\nthe data and fine-tune the model. The Route Segment Density maps were stored in a geohash database to allow quick \\nresponses to spatial queries and partitioning of the data to match user geographical view. \\nThe size of Route Segment Density maps got reduced to approximately 45 percent of the \\noriginal track data, reflecting a significant data reduction. 26 Graphical User Interface A graphical user interface was developed to illustrate the proposed concept and \\ncapabilities. This interactive, web-based interface is a prototype environment that allows \\nuser to conduct what-if analysis, composed of a web application that provides a front-end \\nuser interface using an AngularJS interface and a back-end Java web service interface using \\nSpring. Figure 17. Impact Assessor FAA View (left) and Space Operator View (right) The front-end user interface provides key functionality for the user to configure impact \\nassessment parameters including date, hour, and name of the blocked airspace region. A \\nuser can view traffic density for the selected time on the Route Segment Density map and \\ncan draw airspace on the map. Two views shown are the FAA View and the Space \\nOperator View to provide different perspectives of the same capability to two different \\nstakeholders (see Figure 17). The FAA View provides flight-based metrics and airspace \\nanalysis, whereas the Space Operator View is limited to display of color coded impact-\\nlevels of a specific space launch or reentry operation. The back-end service handles requests from the interface using a REpresentational State \\nTransfer (REST) web service, which provides a uniform interface to the prediction model \\ncapable of rapid assessment of air traffic impact to blocked airspaces. This design decouples \\nthe server and client and enables underlying components, including the prediction model, \\nto be evolved independently of the service interface. The impact assessment data is provided from the web service as a comma separated values \\n(CSV) file, which is reformatted and parsed for display. D3 is used in conjunction with \\nLeaflet to provide both a geospatial mapping display and bar and pie charts displayed after \\nexecuting an analysis. That enables a user to draw an airspace or load in predetermined \\nhazard areas onto a map to instantaneously get metrics and visualize a Route Segment \\nDensity map over the intersecting airspace at a user-designated time. Mapping overlays are \\nexposed using Web Map Service (WMS)6 services, which include contextual charts including 27 6 WMS is OpenGIS standard, information at http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms sectional, and en route low and high charts. The graphical user interface performed well and supported interactive impact analysis; \\nmost queries were serviced within three seconds. VIII. Conclusions and Future Work The rising tempo of activities by new entrants such as space vehicle operators is putting \\nincreasing demands on the national aviation airspace. As air navigation service providers \\n(ANSPs) such as FAA seek to balance competing demands on the NAS safely and efficiently, \\nthere is a need to research ways to increase transparency and collaboration in the use of \\nairspace among all stakeholders. This research is aimed at developing models and \\ntechniques to project, up to 12 months in advance, the impact of blocking any airspace. An \\nexplicit goal of this research is to enable the projection model for use in a what-if analysis \\nthat is accessible to a broad range of users with no prior knowledge of air traffic. Such a \\ncapability will promote collaboration among all stakeholders and ANSPs. There are multiple \\nchallenges in achieving these research goals. First and foremost are the innate uncertainties \\nin factors affecting daily air traffic patterns and its lack of clear predictors. Another \\nchallenge is enabling instantaneous response to the impact queries. In this paper, we present an approach that uses historical traffic patterns to project future \\nNAS impact. We describe a data structure with encoded projection information to support \\nwhat-if analysis capability. We assess the efficacy of the projection model as well as \\nresponsiveness of the web-based prototype based on the model. The results on the efficacy \\nof the data structure show that it is accurately able to represent the projected or historical \\ntraffic flow crossing an arbitrary airspace. The initial results of the projection model show \\ngood performance given the uncertainties of traffic pattern, the robustness of this \\nperformance is an area of continued work. Finally, the performance of the web-based \\nprototype has demonstrated the models ability to support what-if analysis of the impact \\nof blocking airspaces. The projection model is based on the historical traffic pattern, and therefore planned future \\nchanges in route structures will impact the accuracy of the model. Additionally, the model \\ncannot be used to answer queries such as benefit of opening a special use airspace which \\nhas historically been always closed. This research is ongoing, and other approaches to predict impact are being explored. For \\nexample, instead of using route segments, a 10 NM grid might be used to capture historical \\ntraffic patterns and to make projections. Doing so addresses the issue of changes in use of \\nfixes and waypoints. Another avenue being considered is to use the flight schedules for \\npredictions in the near-term range of three to four months. Enhancements to the \\nfunctionality and features are also being researched. These include assessment of extra \\ndistance and delay as an additional impact metrics, the ability to assess the impact of \\nmultiple airspaces of the same time or of differing time windows, including altitude 28 attributes for an airspace (floor and ceiling), and extending the model to locations \\nworldwide.
