The resultant model provides an overall architecture suitability measure as well as individual node pass/fail results, based on specified requirements. Total suitability as well as detailed pass/fail results can then be exported as spreadsheets and further visualized using bar charts and other interactive data visualization methods to support agile decision making. 1 MEME (Mission Essential and Mission Enhancing): Capabilities that enable leaders and commanders to effectively execute mission command tasks at the tactical-edge of the modern battlefield; must be integrated into BCTs in the near-term. Mission Enhancing: Capabilities that further expand the capacity of tactical leaders on the battlefield; BCTs can assume risk in the near- term by delaying immediate integration and/or extending development (in resource constrained environment). 3 Approved for Public Release Distribution Unlimited Case Number 16-4263 Proposed architectural changes can be made using the spreadsheets and then used to auto- update and inform architectural changes in the model. Mission Thread analysis Created an executable mission animation thread using SysML for \\nan Army MEDEVAC scenario. This animation allowed the authors to evaluate a functional thread through the architecture model to understand mission sequencing, operational impact, and completion criteria. Additional threads can be added following same pattern. The third type of analysis is an ongoing effort and consists of mission performance analysis using Discrete Event Simulation (DES). When completed, this effort will enable a user to import vetted architecture mission threads into a DES without having to recreate the threads using DES tools, while maintaining end-to-end traceability back to the architectural model and stakeholder needs. Further, factors not represented in the architecture, such as environment, threats and failures can be examined more efficiently in the high-performance DES environment. Integration into the high- performance DES environment exceeded the scope of this exploratory pilot. The following subsections describe the model that was developed during this pilot project using Army sponsor data. The results are presented in Section 0. 1.3 Model-Based Solution 1.3.1 Model Description We started with a System Architecture Model (SAM) to provide the overall context in which the analysis takes place. By integrating high fidelity analysis through a consistently defined architecture, several system configurations can be analyzed to provide insight into key system characteristics that are not evident though analysis alone. Further, automation of analysis allows more options to be considered in a timely manner. The model provides a systematic approach for managing the inter-dependencies of system properties, constraints on those properties and required outcomes spanning across a system to support multi-dimensional analysis. The model captures the final solution as well as the rational and excluded solutions, thereby preserving both formal and tacit knowledge. Such an electronically integrated model and data allows for the automation of otherwise time consuming analysis setup, thus allowing more time for actual analysis and incorporation of iterative stakeholder feedback. 1.3.2 Model Inputs from the Sponsor The following sets of data were provided by the Army Sponsor: Network Basis of Issue (NBOI) Data Radio Architecture data for every node in an Army \\nBrigade in spreadsheet format. This includes the physical radios assigned to each node and radio frequency (RF)2 / subnet configurations of each radio. Note1: RF is usually represented by an image called waveform, which is the term used throughout the rest of this paper. Note2: For the pilot model only a portion of the entire NBOI data was used. MEME (Mission Essential and Mission Enhancing) Requirements Requirements for \\nconnectivity based on the role of each node. \\n2 RF: any of the electromagnetic wave frequencies that lie in the range extending from below 3 kilohertz to about 300 gigahertz and that include the frequencies used for communications signals (as for radio and television broadcasting and cell-phone and satellite transmissions) or radar signals (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/radio%20frequency). 4 Approved for Public Release Distribution Unlimited Case Number 16-4263 MEDEVAC Mission Thread The thread of connected nodes needed to successfully \\ncomplete a MEDEVAC mission. Figure 1 illustrates the three sets of Army provided data and how the data was used to populate the model that was developed using No Magics MagicDraw SysML Modeling tool.3 \\nFigure 1. Army provided data feeding the Model 1.3.3 Model Structure Army organizations are structured hierarchically. This hierarchy is represented in the model by a Block Definition Diagram. Every organization is represented as a Block (hereafter called a node following Army nomenclature) and is named with the unique ID from the Army NBOI data to maintain traceability. Figure 2 represents the hierarchy of the nodes contained in this model. \\n3 http://www.nomagic.com/ 5 Approved for Public Release Distribution Unlimited Case Number 16-4263 Figure 2. Army Brigade hierarchy represented in a Block Definition Diagram Every node in the model has properties that map to values in the NBOI data. Nodes also have properties whose values are derived from the analysis conducted on the model. The properties defined for each node are shown in Figure 3 below. \\nFigure 3. The NBOI Node block from which every node inherits properties To work with various configurations of architectures, multiple instances of the entire architecture were generated. The default values for each nodes properties were imported from the NBOI data. However, the properties can be changed to perform trade-off analyses and to dynamically determine architecture configurations that fully satisfy the requirements and complete mission threads. By changing the waveform / sub-net configuration of the radios at each node, the list of nodes it can communicate with is changed. 2 Analysis and Results 2.1 MEME Requirements Analysis Description The Army Sponsor provided a spreadsheet that contained MEME requirements. A snippet of the spread sheet is shown in Figure 4 below (cell values have been blanked out). The circled cells are explained below. 6 Approved for Public Release Distribution Unlimited Case Number 16-4263 Figure 4. Snippet of Original MEME Spreadsheet To set up the model and support requirements analysis: A customized MEMERequirement stereotype was defined in the model to capture additional \\nrequirements metadata (to augment those defined by the SysML language). The identified metadata properties were mapped as MEMERequirement properties. \\no Starting with the MEME Cells circled in Figure 4, the new properties were defined using a <<MEMEReq>> stereotype, and o Several <<enumeration>> stereotypes and were tied to rows or columns in the \\nMEME spreadsheet. The enumeration MEMERoleKind is a list of values from Col B. These are \\nused to populate the new requirement property by the same name. MEMEOrgCatKind enumerations correspond to Col A, while \\nMEMEOpCatKind enumerations come from Row 4. SysML Constraints Blocks were created to codify the rules for evaluating the various \\nRequirements for validation and were linked to the corresponding requirement. There is also a Verdict property that was used for storing the results from the analysis. \\nIn this pilot, we focused on analyzing Requirements, but the approach described here can be applied to any important program data such as cost, power, risks, security, etc. The pilot model focused on voice line-of-site radio connection requirements. The MEME role is indicative of a role a node makes, but is not a one to one correspondence. After this model set up was completed, Army requirements were imported from the MEME spreadsheet into the model. 7 Approved for Public Release Distribution Unlimited Case Number 16-4263 Each node in the model must satisfy the requirement that maps to its role. The set of requirements from the Armys spreadsheet is traced to a node in the model that is expected to meet the requirement or play a role in achieving it. The model also defined a library of reusable constraints that can be applied to any requirement. These constraints provide the construct through which analysis can be performed on whether a specific configuration (deployment of specific radio/wave form to a node) will enable the node to meet the communication requirements it needs to accomplish its mission. The constraints were applied during the parametric analysis described below. Figure 5. The library of constraint blocks used in the parametric analysis 8 Approved for Public Release Distribution Unlimited Case Number 16-4263 2.2 Parametric Analysis Description Figure 6 below is a parametric diagram that illustrates how various constraints take inputs and produce outputs after executing to produce the values for the derived properties based on the execution. This process includes five steps: 1. The node properties that map to NBOI data are used to seed the Analysis Configuration \\nBuilder (1). 2. The automated process, with inputs from step 1, determines which MEME Requirement the \\nnode must satisfy. Based on the requirement, it selects the set of constraints that need to be evaluated to satisfy the requirement (2). 3. The constraints accessed model data by using calls to the Magicdraw API (3). The node can \\neither Pass or Fail each constraint. The logic for each constraint was developed with the assistance of MITRE and Sponsor Army SMEs. In this manner, the constraint provides an explanation for what a Fail for a node means. 4. The results of each constraint are logically AND-ed in the Verdict constraint to determine \\nthe overall requirement satisfaction (4).",
