The atmospheric drag was estimated by: = 12 qG\\nCp) ( Figure 2-12 Atmospheric Drag Torque Equation Like SRP, when the center of atmospheric pressure, determined by the spacecraft area exposed to the atmosphere in the direction of the orbital velocity (i.e. ram direction), is not aligned with the center of mass, a torque occurs. The density of air is estimated using an upper atmospheric model derived by NASA: = 131.21 + .00299 = 2.488 + 273.1216.6 |.~}} q = .2869 + 273.1 Figure 2-13 Upper Atmospheric Air Model Equations [8] The drag coefficient was estimated at a constant 2.2 (as is common practice for a LEO flying satellite). The ram area was calculated for the worst-case scenario by determining the largest area of all the sides. Lastly, the maximum distance from the aerodynamic center of pressure to the center of mass was calculated. 2.10.4.4 Magnetic Torque Calculation The Earths liquid core is a dynamo that induces a magnetic field.

When the satellites residual moment is not aligned to the local magnetic field from Earth, the satellite experiences a magnetic torque that attempts to align the two. The magnitude of this magnetic torque can be calculated using the equation presented in Figure 2-14. = At = A K~ Figure 2-14 Magnetic Torque Equation This equation models the Earths magnetic field as a dipole. The spacecrafts dipole moment is assumed to be 1 for a small, uncompensated spacecraft. Earths magnetic constant is estimated at 7.18 10\\u007f Tm~. Lastly, lambda is a unitless function of the magnetic latitude that ranges from 1 \\nat the magnetic equator to 2 at the magnetic poles. 2.10.4.5 Gravity-Gradient Torque Calculation The final torque requiring computation was the gravity-gradient torque. Gravity-gradient torques arise when the spacecrafts center of gravity is not aligned with its center of mass with respect to the local vertical. The gravity-gradient torque increases as a function of the angle between the local vertical and the spacecrafts principal axes with the gravity-gradient torque always trying to align the minimum principal axis with the local vertical. Figure 2-15 provides a simplified equation for the gravity-gradient torque for a spacecraft with the minimum principal axis in its Z- direction is shown below.

To determine the mass of a reaction wheel, data was collected on several commercially available reaction wheels. With the data gathered in MATLAB, a fourth-order polynomial curve was fit to the data to compare the momentum storage capabilities of the reaction wheels and their weight in kilograms. From the polynomial curve, an approximate mass was selected based off the momentum storage capabilities. 2.10.4.7 ACS Propulsion Sizing The ACS propulsion sizing requires five inputs: the mass of the spacecraft, the center of gravity, satellite lifetime, the saturation point of a reaction wheel (secular angular momentum), and the rate of saturation of a reaction wheel. These were used to compute the momentum dumping fuel mass required over the satellite lifetime and the thrust required for a single momentum dump. Although the proposed design includes four thrusters for momentum dumping and one main thruster, this code utilizes six thrusters (one on each side) and chooses the shortest moment arm which will require the largest thrust to design for the worst-case scenario. The author assumed that the thruster required for momentum dumping will fire for one second. With the worst-case moment arm calculated, the thrust required to dump the momentum is calculated (per pulse) using the following equation. = > Figure 2-16 Thrust Per Momentum Dump Equation ! = cd c# !5 7 = cd # 4# # 7/ \\n = # \\n 4# 7 \\n ; = ]7# $ ;# &5 ^ 78 \\n ; = ]7# $ ;# &5 ^ 78 \\n < = =# & # ` # = ! = !5 = 3 ]7# 57 7/ \\n \\\" = !5 ]7# =7 7 \\n = F5# !7 2-25 The propellant mass required for ACS over the satellite lifetime is then calculated with these equations. Z\\\\ = 3 >Ov 365.25. O (MZ\\\\ = Z\\\\ .L Z\\\\ is the total number of thruster firings required throughout the lifetime of the spacecraft \\nto ensure that the reaction wheels can control the attitude of the spacecraft. The numerator of the first equation in Figure 2-17 has a factor of 3 because three reaction wheels will need to be desaturated each time a momentum dump is required. Lastly, since hydrazine was selected as the fuel of choice, the .L is 218 seconds. \\n2.10.4.8 ACS Model Outputs This completes the ACS model process. In the Command Window of MATLAB, the following items are printed: cyclical angular momentum per orbit, secular angular momentum per orbit, reaction wheel mass, the fuel required for momentum dumping, and the thrust required per momentum dump. In addition, a polar graph showing the individual and total torques over the entire orbit is displayed.

A publicly available special purpose model was selected due to its free nature. While SME: The New SMAD [1] presents several publicly available special purpose cost 2-27 estimating models, the SSCM is selected because of its usefulness in pricing spacecraft weighing less than 500 kg. Developed by The Aerospace Corporation, it is assumed that these cost estimating relationships (CERs) include the cost of contractor program management, systems engineering, product assurance, and I&T. The equations used to determine the CERS are shown below, and FY10 dollars have been adjusted to FY18 when utilized.
