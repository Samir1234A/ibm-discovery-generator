partnering with community colleges \\nfor low-cost training opportunities; supporting \\napprenticeships and on-the-job training; and \\nestablishing academies to train on special skills \\nthat are difficult to acquire, highly sought after, and \\nrapidly changing (e g , artificial intelligence, data \\nscience, cybersecurity) Report Symposium on the Federal Workforce for the 21st Century14 From 2017 Federal Employee \\nViewpoint Survey: of respondents said they \\nare satisfied they have \\nopportunities to get a better \\njob in their organizations %35 Performance management In a growing trend, private sector \\norganizations have shifted from \\nfocusing on a formal, annual rating \\nor ranking process to an iterative \\ncoaching and feedback process that is more informal and frequent Companies \\nsuch as Accenture, Deloitte, McKinsey, and BCG \\nhave moved to this model of ongoing coaching \\nand feedback as a way of increasing engagement \\nwhile also providing performance feedback This \\nis quickly becoming the norm in the private sector, \\nespecially in those organizations that employ \\nknowledge workers In a Harvard Business Review \\n(HBR) article about Deloittes new performance \\nmanagement approach, the writer notes, Weve \\narrived at a very different and much simpler \\ndesign for managing peoples performance Its \\nhallmarks are speed, agility, one-size-fits-one, \\nand constant learning 10 Exploring this approach in the federal sector rep- resents an opportunity to address an area where \\nthe federal government scores are lower than \\nprivate sector comparisons in the Federal Employ-\\nee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS), and where the lowest \\nresults are in the performance-based rewards and \\nadvancement categories As the results suggest, \\nfewer than half of federal employees are satisfied with the relationship between pay, promotions, \\nawards, and their performance Symposium participants from private sector \\nand state government, as well as MITRE, not-\\ned they have already begun to train managers to \\noffer frequent, informal feedback and guidance \\nto meet employees expectations and measure \\nmanagers ability to do so successfully Millennials \\nexpect more feedback from their managersat \\nleast monthly 11 As a result, these companies have \\nreduced their reliance on rating scales and rank-\\ning employees in typical bell curves and relative \\nrankings Beyond assessing employees job and \\nactivities, managers assess staff on their individual \\nvalue to the organization based on their skills and \\nthe results or outcomes they deliver Symposium participants whose organizations are \\nimplementing this newer approach indicate that \\nit appears to be creating more engagement and \\nstrengthening relationships between manager \\nand employees They said that balancing frequent \\ncoaching with performance feedback helps their \\nstaff respond and adjust throughout the annual \\nperformance cycle That said, successful imple-\\nmentation requires training and incentivizing man-\\nagers to embrace this new approach to working \\nwith their staff while evaluating their own perfor-\\nmance for this responsibility Partnerships During the symposium, discussions \\nprobed how the private sector and \\nsome states have partnered with \\ncommunity colleges and universities \\nto develop curricula focused on building skills for specific occupational needs 12 \\n An engaged workforce is the most powerful workforce that you can possibly have Report Symposium on the Federal Workforce for the 21st Century 15The MITRE Corporation of respondents felt that \\npay is based on how well \\nthey perform their jobs of respondents indicated \\nthey feel promotions in \\ntheir work unit are based \\non merit 47% \\nof respondents believe \\nthat awards in their work \\nunit are based on how well \\nthey perform their jobs 31%35% The federal government has similar options \\nBy focusing first on potential human capital \\nshortages or specific talent gaps, the government \\ncan then determine which educational platforms \\nor institutions might offer the most viable \\npartnership opportunities As many private sector \\norganizations are struggling with similar skill gap \\nshortages, opportunities exist to work in tandem \\nParticipants discussed options such as building \\napprenticeship or credentialing programs that \\nfocus on specific areas (e g , cybersecurity) Partnerships can also increase opportunities for \\nemployees to gain and learn from new experiences \\nSymposium participants discussed the need to \\nincrease opportunities for government employees \\nto work outside the federal government; gain \\nexperience, knowledge, and skills; and then return \\nto apply their new knowledge and skills to their \\ngovernment work This type of exchange creates \\nthe mobility and diverse experiences that early- \\nand mid-career professionals seek It enables \\nemployees to develop skills and expertise in areas \\noutside their comfort zones and exposes them to \\nother organizational methodologies and cultures Participants also referenced models that allowed \\nfor private sector and non-governmental organiza-\\ntions to be involved in filling government roles and \\ndeveloping government employees Programs such \\nas the U S Digital Service and authorities such as \\nthe Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA)13 and \\nthe Critical Hiring Authority, for example, allow \\nthe government to recruit top technologists for \\nterm-limited tours of duty The IRS closed several centers, and \\neach of those centers had between \\n3,000 and 5,000 employees Most \\nof the people at the centers were \\ndoing data entry When the centers \\nwere closed, the data transcription \\nfunction was no longer needed But \\nrather than let the employees go, the \\nIRS prepared for the transition by \\nproviding training to the impacted \\nemployees The goal was to prepare \\nthe people for the future and the \\nchanging nature of work 16 Report Symposium on the Federal Workforce for the 21st Century Technology and data Participants discussed the value of \\nharnessing available data to inform \\ndecision-making around strategic \\ninvestments and talent management \\nsolutions that address workforce needs, trends, and gaps Indeed, dynamic work \\nconditions are forcing changes For example, the \\npractice of using static position descriptions to \\nhire entry-level employees is evolving as managers now realize that an employees skills must adapt in \\ntandem with the job requirements, particularly for \\njobs reliant on technology Moving forward, effort \\nshould be made to transition to more dynamic \\nmethods of data capture, which could inform \\nthose position descriptions and therefore drive \\ncompensation and selection Leveraging data to identify emerging trends that \\nmay affect government operations and service \\ndelivery allows agencies to plan for anticipated \\nchanges in workflow and staffing For example, the \\ndata from existing human capital systems (e g , po-\\nsitions, occupations, career levels, competencies) \\ncan be compared with emerging work needs The \\nresults enable valuable discussions about how an individual employees career path and an organi-\\nzations workforce planning needs might fruitfully \\nintersect For example, representatives from the \\nprivate sector described the importance of data \\nscience to drive agile workforce strategies such as \\nwhere to apply training investments, who may be \\nat risk of leaving, which skills are needed where, \\nand which incentives and rewards will provide the \\ngreatest value to employees Symposium participants emphasized that \\ntechnology should be an enabler of people, not \\nthe other way around: We need to make the \\ntechnology work for us Analyzing data related \\nto workloads alongside metrics for capturing \\nthe demand for government services will allow \\nagencies to accurately assess the impact of \\nautomation Assessment is essential to planning \\nfor and capturing shifts as they happenas \\npositions change to reflect increased reliance on \\ntechnology in the delivery of these services As an \\nexample, artificial intelligence may enable a change \\nin process so that technology will replace routine \\nwork that does not require human judgment 17The MITRE Corporation RECOMMENDATIONS \\nThroughout the symposium, participants shared accounts of their activities, decisions, \\nand experiences, all of which touched on the \\nopportunities discussed previously While the \\nconversations surfaced many ideas, some of the \\nsuggestions stood out because of their potential \\nfor transformational impact for the federal \\ngovernment, and because they had: demonstrable impact in local or state govern-\\nment or in the private or nonprofit sectors viability as determined by academic and \\napplied research results potential to be scaled widely across the \\ngovernment applicability to multiple challenges and \\nopportunities relevance to the Presidents Management \\nAgenda For the purposes of this report, we have \\nhighlighted nine",
