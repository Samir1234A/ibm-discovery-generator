  "sdl_extracted_summary": "from a wide variety of persons and organizations with either direct experience with implementing payment reform or deep experience in the health care field. CAMH convened two Work Groups, the Population-Based Payment (PBP) Work Group and the Clinical Episode Payment (CEP) Work Group, to develop recommendations for the implementation of these types of payment models. Their recommendations focus on specific design elements, many of which overlap and upon which there was much common agreement even as the Work Groups deliberated separately. Each of the four PBP White Papers described below focuses on a separate design element (financial benchmarking, patient attribution, performance measurement, and data sharing) in a PBP context. In a PBP arrangement, an accountable entity takes responsibility for the care for a defined population over a specified period of time (typically a year) for the full continuum of care. These design elements should be considered as a whole for effective PBP implementation as they interact considerably. The CEP Work Group also divided their recommendations into design elements, but included several operational considerations along with 10 design elements. The recommendations were organized in chapters in the comprehensive White Paper and applied to three clinical areas where clinical episode payment models would be most effective: elective joint replacement, maternity care, and coronary artery disease (CAD). While the clinical focus is more targeted here, the underlying concepts for setting the episode price (including the level and type of risk), defining the population and services included in the episode, patient engagement and quality metrics, and the data infrastructure are similar to those of the four PBP White Papers. The LAN convened the Data Sharing Requirements Initiative (DSRI) to gather information on recent approaches and experiences building data-sharing capacity. The DSRI leadership team incorporated input from interviews with organizations engaged in data sharing in support of APMs, and reviewed material on critical developments in technology and policy. The resulting toolkit is meant to be of practical value for those planning and developing future data sharing activities. The following provides links and a brief overview of each of the papers written by the LAN Work Groups. By reading the full suite of products, readers of this paper will be better able to make decisions about the most effective payment model(s) to implement and the key issues to consider when designing those models.

Population-Based Payment (PBP) Models: Accelerating and Aligning Population-Based Payment (PBP): Patient Attribution The Patient Attribution White Paper describes the method by which patient populations are assigned to providers who are accountable for total cost of care and quality outcomes for their designated populations in a PBP model. The paper recommends that active, intentional identification, or self- reporting by patients, should be considered first. The paper also outlines nine additional https://www.hcp-lan.org/\\nhttps://hcp-lan.org/groups/work-group-products/\\nhttps://hcp-lan.org/groups/pbp/pa-final-whitepaper/ Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2546. 42 recommendations that payers and providers can use when making decisions on attribution in their PBP models. Accelerating and Aligning Population-Based Payment (PBP): Financial Benchmarking The Financial Benchmarking White Paper describes approaches for setting an initial benchmark and updates over time, as well as addresses risk-adjustment considerations. The White Paper discusses the need to balance voluntary participation with the movement toward convergence in a market with providers at different starting points. Accelerating and Aligning Population-Based Payment (PBP): Data Sharing The Data Sharing White Paper offers several guiding principles and recommendations that highlight the future development of data sharing arrangements in PBP models. The paper also outlines use cases for data sharing which describe particular types of data sharing arrangements, in both their current and aspirational states. The goal is to create an environment where data follows the patient and is available to stakeholders (patients, providers, purchasers, and payers) in a timely manner. Accelerating and Aligning Population-Based Payment (PBP): Performance Measurement The Performance Measurement White Paper offers both short-term action recommendations and a long-term vision for accelerating alignment around APMs. The paper offers a way forward that could lead to radical change in how performance is measured across the board in order to enable the implementation of effective population-based payments. The White Paper describes how to evolve from granular measurement systems of the full continuum of care, which focus on narrow and specific care processes, to more macro-level measurement systems oriented on outcomes. The paper also makes strong recommendations for immediate action steps by describing four key performance measurement principles and seven recommendations for building and sustaining a performance measurement system that supports and encourages collaboration among stakeholders. Clinical Episode Payment (CEP) Models: Accelerating and Aligning Selected Clinical Episode Payment (CEP) Models This paper provides high-level recommendations for designing clinical episode payment models. A clinical episode payment is a bundled payment for a set of services that occur over time and across settings. The paper outlines design elements and operational considerations for three selected clinical areas: elective joint replacement, maternity care, and coronary artery disease. Recommendations are organized according to design elements and operational considerations. Design elements address questions stakeholders must consider when designing an episode payment model, including the definition, the duration of the episode, what services are to be included, and others. Operational considerations relate to implementing an episode payment model, including the roles and perspectives of stakeholders, data infrastructure issues, and the regulatory environment in which APMs must operate. https://hcp-lan.org/groups/pbp/fb-final-whitepaper/\\nhttps://hcp-lan.org/groups/pbp/fb-final-whitepaper/\\nhttps://hcp-lan.org/groups/pbp/ds-final-whitepaper/\\nhttps://hcp-lan.org/groups/pbp/pm-final-whitepaper/\\nhttps://hcp-lan.org/groups/pbp/pm-final-whitepaper/\\nhttps://hcp-lan.org/groups/cep/clinical-episode-payment/ Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2546. 43 Several key principles drove the development of the recommendations across all three episodes: 1) incentivizing person-centered care; 2) improving patient outcomes through effective care coordination; 3) rewarding high value care by incentivizing providers and patients, together with their family caregivers, to discuss the appropriateness of procedures; and 4) reducing unnecessary costs to the patient and the health care system. The recommendations are designed to speak to a multi-stakeholder audience with the goal of supporting broad clinical episode payment adoption. Elective Joint Replacement The elective joint replacement recommendations emphasize using functional status assessments (both pre- and post-procedure) and shared decision-making tools to determine whether a joint replacement is the appropriate treatment for a given patient. Maternity Care The maternity care recommendations emphasize the need for patient engagement, education, and parenting support services (in addition to clinical maternity care), to achieve a number of critical goals. These include increasing the percentage of full-term births and the percentage of vaginal births, while decreasing the percentage of pre-term and early elective births, complications, and mortality. Coronary Artery Disease The coronary artery disease (CAD) recommendations are based on a CAD condition-level episode, which includes a nested bundle for procedures like percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The recommendations emphasize overall condition management designed to reduce the need for procedures, and strong coordination and communication between the surgeons who perform cardiac procedures and the providers who deliver follow-up and long-term cardiac care. Primary Care Payment Models (PCPM): Accelerating and Aligning Primary Care Payment Models Primary care is a critical link in health care delivery. Often patients first point of contact with the health care system, primary care practitioners make decisions that broadly impact both patient health and total health care spending. The Primary Care Payment Model (PCPM) White Paper views primary care teams as uniquely positioned to serve as catalysts for innovative care as well as effective stewards of health care resources. The paper offers principles and recommendations for implementing PCPMs that can help overcome the barriers to effective primary care tied to traditional fee-for-service payments based on the volume of services provided rather than the quality and value of care. Data Sharing Requirements Initiative (DSRI): Collaborative Approaches to Advance Data Sharing One of the key insights from the DSRI findings is the essential role, in developing data sharing capacity, of collaboration, shared goals, and shared solutions to enable sustainable APM success. Unlike fee-for- https://hcp-lan.org/groups/cep/ejr-final/\\nhttps://hcp-lan.org/groups/cep/maternity-final/\\nhttps://hcp-lan.org/groups/cep/cad-final/\\nhttps://hcp-lan.org/groups/pcpm/pcpm-final-whitepaper/\\nhttps://hcp-lan.org/groups/dsri-report/ Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2546. 44 service payment models that largely limit accountability to a single setting (such as hospital or physicians office), APMs require providers to understand and/or be accountable for patients across the medical neighborhood and over time. While the toolkit is not a how to guide, as the specifics for each organization and region differ, it will be helpful in the strategic planning process to identify the APM functions that require data sharing, to assess current capacity and barriers, and to consider strategies within and across organizations to fill gaps in necessary data sharing functionality. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2546. 45 Appendix E: Principles for Patient- and Family-Centered Payment The following principles, produced by the LANs Consumer and Patient Affinity Group, are intended to help guide the development of new payment strategies. They provide guidance and aspirational direction to ensure that we address the needs and priorities of patients and families as we transition to value-based payment. The principles rest on the conviction that consumers, patients, and families are essential partners in every aspect of transforming health care and improving health. Consumers, patients, families, and their advocates should be collaboratively engaged in all aspects",

  "text": "Safety is the highest priority in aviation, and \\nATM plays an important part in ensuring \\noverall aviation safety. The concept of safety may need to be \\nreimagined when interactions only \\ninvolve unmanned vehicles.6 Global Interoperability The ATM system should be based on global \\nstandards and uniform principles to ensure \\nthe technical and operational \\ninteroperability of ATM systems and \\nfacilitate homogeneous and non-\\ndiscriminatory global and regional traffic \\nflows. An important factor since operators \\nintend to have missions that span the \\nglobe. Flexibility Flexibility addresses the ability of all \\nairspace users to modify flight trajectories \\ndynamically and adjust departure and \\narrival times, thereby permitting them to \\nexploit operational opportunities as they \\noccur. Some users will require this more than \\nothers, such as those who are reliant on \\nwind for propulsion or are highly \\nsensitive to wind speed. Mission needs \\nare also likely to require flexibility. Access and Equity A global ATM system should provide an \\noperating environment that ensures that all \\nairspace users have right of access to the \\nATM resources needed to meet their specific \\noperational requirements and that the shared \\nuse of airspace by different users can be \\nachieved safely. One of the most difficult requirements \\nto meet given the heterogeneous mix of \\nmissions and vehicle performance. It \\nwill be particularly important for those \\noperations that transit regions occupied \\nby constellations of on-station vehicles. Security Security refers to the protection against \\nthreats that stem from intentional acts (e.g., \\nterrorism) or unintentional acts (e.g., human \\nerror, natural disaster) affecting aircraft, \\npeople or installations on the ground. This is an important concern, given that \\nthis region will largely be inhabited by \\nunmanned vehicles; cybersecurity and \\nspectrum security will be vital but not \\nunique to higher airspace. Cost-Effectiveness The ATM system should be cost-effective, \\nwhile balancing the varied interests of the \\nATM community. The current system (which usually \\nrelies on fuel taxes and overflight fees) \\nis not aligned well with the mission \\nlengths or power sources in higher \\nairspace. Predictability Predictability refers to the ability of airspace \\nusers and ATM service providers to provide \\nconsistent and dependable levels of \\nperformance. Trajectories of new vehicles are \\nexpected to become more predictable \\nover time. However, the broad range of \\ntrajectories is likely to persist. Capacity The global ATM system should exploit the \\ninherent capacity to meet airspace user \\ndemands at peak times and locations while \\nminimizing restrictions on traffic flow. Airspace capacity is unlikely to be a \\nconcern in the near to mid-term due to \\nlow traffic levels and natural \\ngeographic segregation. Operators who 6 7 A recent example from surface transportation involves the introduction of autonomous vehicles. A fatal accident made national \\nnews when a self-driving Uber car killed a pedestrian [6]. However, the other, approximately 6,000 pedestrian fatalities in \\n2017, involving manned vehicles rarely, if ever, make national headlines [7]. use more than one vehicle per mission, \\ntypically networked with their nearby \\nvehicles, may experience capacity \\nconstraints. Participation by the \\nATM Community The ATM community should have a \\ncontinuous involvement in the planning, \\nimplementation and operation of the system \\nto ensure that the evolution of the global \\nATM system meets the expectations of the \\ncommunity. The user community is not anticipated \\nto be large, so this should not be \\nchallenging, and could prove to be \\neffective for collaborative strategic \\ndeconfliction. Efficiency Efficiency addresses the operational and \\neconomic cost-effectiveness of gate-to-gate \\nflight operations from a single-flight \\nperspective. Transport operations are likely to value \\nthis more than operations that provide \\nother services. Environment The ATM system should contribute to the \\nprotection of the environment by considering \\nnoise, gaseous emissions and other \\nenvironmental issues in the implementation \\nand operation of the global ATM system. This is not a focus area for operators, as \\nmost vehicles with horizontal \\ntrajectories in higher airspace are \\nenvironmentally friendly, with some \\nnotable exceptions (sonic booms from \\nMach travel). Additional Requirements \\nto Consider (not ICAO) Portability The system can be accessed from multiple locations on the ground and \\nuses technology and hardware that are readily available to key system users. Safety is listed first because the expectation of safe passage is fundamental to the system. New \\ncommercial operators and vehicle types are particularly susceptible to repercussions when safety \\nincidents occur.7 \\nSafety, quantified as risk, is a continuum. Not all operations have the same level of risk tolerance \\nor aversion. More risk is tolerated when operations are less likely to result in casualties or injuries \\n(e.g., unmanned operations) in the air or on the ground. More risk is also tolerated when transport \\nis conducted for private purposes rather than for hire. This continuum is a fundamental concept \\nthat will be invoked when discussing needs and service levels related to ATM components in the \\nnext section.\\nThe first column of Table 2 lists the system attributes that all users value in principle and the \\nthird column suggests which attributes are most relevant to the higher airspace community. \\nWhile there may be general agreement among the higher airspace community, getting all \\nstakeholders to agree to a common set of values may be challenging given the diverse mission \\nneeds of the operators. Even users of todays ATM system rarely share the same values (e.g., \\ngeneral aviation, cargo, and passenger operations have different priorities). \\nAdding to the challenge, many system attributes are interdependent and an emphasis in one area \\ncan reduce performance in another area. For example: A secure system may restrict access, have less flexibility and forego interoperability. Access and equity may be restricted to ensure safety. Increased flexibility may come at the expense of system efficiency and capacity.\\nTo be useful, expectations must be prioritized so that necessary tradeoffs will be guided by what 7 matters most. ICAO recognizes this in its Manual on Global Performance of the Air Navigation \\nSystem (Document 9883), which advocates a balanced approach in Part I Appendix B, Section \\n4.1 [8]. \\nHigher airspace user expectations have been prioritized in Table 3. They represent an average of \\nindividual rankings derived from two sources: Rankings provided directly from several operators. We received rankings from three \\ndifferent vehicle categories. A compilation of priorities ascertained from discussions with operators, public \\nstatements made by industry representatives on conference panels, and during \\nAerospace Industry Association meetings. Expectations were ranked using one of three values: high, medium and low. Priorities may \\nchange over time; the prioritization of user expectations in Table 3 represents a mid-term (ten \\nyears out) outlook. \\nSafety, global interoperability, access and equity, and flexibility ranked the highest, with safety \\nbeing a unanimous priority. Having stated that, users operating unmanned vehicles in higher \\nairspace may have a higher safety risk tolerance than manned operations. Global interoperability \\nis crucial to many of the business models and also minimizes conflicting vehicle design and \\nequipage requirements. Access and equity will be critical given the diversity in missions and \\nvehicle performance. Finally, flexibility will be crucial since many of these operations do not \\nplan to follow the traditional transport model (people and cargo) but will need to regularly alter \\ntheir flight plans to respond to winds and business needs.

Efficiency 7\\nEnvironment8 8 * Range is from 1 to 9 Traffic Management in Higher Airspace\\nAir traffic management services have evolved to serve legacy operations below 52,000 feet.9 As a \\nresult, these services are not as well-suited to serve the unique vehicles and missions planned for \\nhigher airspace. This section provides an overview of how current ATM services could be \\nadapted to the higher airspace environment. \\nThe seven traffic management components identified by ICAOs GATMOC were used to frame \\nthe evaluation. For those components relevant to higher airspace, varying levels of service are \\nidentified along with qualitative triggers for additional services. Adapting Traffic Management to Meet the Challenges of Higher Airspace\\nThe traffic management implications referred to earlier suggest that it would be ineffective to rely \\nheavily on tactical separation provision and last resort collision avoidance in higher airspace. \\nTactical separation rests largely on a vehicles ability to deconflict trajectories via maneuvering. \\nMost vehicles in higher airspace will have a limited range of maneuverability. Last resort \\ncollision avoidance relies on the operators situational awareness (visually or though \\ntechnological aids akin to Traffic Collision Avoidance System) to see (or detect) and avoid. The \\nmajority of higher airspace operations will not have an onboard pilot and will need to limit \\nequipage (due to weight sensitivity), leaving few, if any, feasible options for last resort collision \\navoidance.\\nThis leaves strategic trajectory deconfliction as the primary mechanism for managing traffic in \\nhigher airspace.
