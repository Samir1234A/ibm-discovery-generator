  "text": "the high activity day shown in Figure 12 an observer would \\nneed a connection with a minimum bandwidth of 646 Mbps (million bits per second) to intake \\nthe direct feed data at the maximum message rate with no delay or packet loss in transmission. \\nHowever, the 646 Mbps figure does not account for intra-second bursts which can reach as high \\nas 2,700 Mbps from a single exchange10. Due to the high message rates, exchanges recommend \\nmarket participants connect to their data feeds at rates of 1 Gbps or higher. The average rate \\nobserved across all exchanges based on the data in Figure 12 is a factor of about 18 less than the \\nmaximum rate. This observed average rate scaling factor is in line with the stated average rate \\nscaling factor by BATS of 1921. Infrastructure3.4\\nThe infrastructure that connects the exchanges is differentiated by bandwidth, latency, and price. \\nConnections between the exchanges are offered in four main ways10: Virtual Private Network\\nLow bandwidth, high latency, low priceo This runs through the public, internet backbone and is for applications which are not o\\ntime-critical. Co-location\\nHigh bandwidth, low latency, high priceo 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps connections for when the receiver is in the same facility as the o\\nexchange. Extranet\\nMedium bandwidth, medium latency, medium priceo Access exchange data through a third-party connection.o Private line Ethernet\\nDirect point-to-point connection via fiber-optic or microwave/millimeter wave o\\nantennas between exchanges or between an exchange and a participant\\nFiber-optico High bandwidth, low latency, high price Microwave/millimeter wave wireless22o http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/Productsservices/trading/CoLo/ExpressConnectFS.pdf xvi 23 http://qnasdaqomx.com/WirelessConnectivity \\n24 http://anova-tech.com/sample-page/map/\\n25 In additional to this technical report, HSSEDI has also developed a visualization application to animate these dynamic flows. \\nContact the NGCI Apex Program Management Office or HSSEDI for access to this visualization application. Medium bandwidth, very low latency, very high price These connections are not mutually exclusive for exchange data customers. A trading firm may \\nbe co-located in an exchange and have with both fiber and wireless connections to other \\nexchanges. While the wireless connections are considered supplemental23 to fiber-optic they \\ncommand a premium price due to their speed. The speed difference for the wireless millimeter-\\nwave connections can be significant with a Carteret to Secaucus, NJ latency of 153s compared \\nto 93s on a fiber optic line24 40% faster. Dynamic Message Traffic3.5\\nThe image in Figure 13 and Figure 14 shows freeze frames taken from a message visualization \\napplication25 developed to explore the dynamics of financial data. They show individual trades \\npassing between the exchanges to an observer at Carteret, NJ, one of the main exchange \\nlocations. Each rectangle represents a trade with the width being proportional to the number of \\nshares in that trade. \\nFigure 13 depicts two stocks, Bank of America (BAC) in blue and AAPL in green. Trades of \\nBAC are recorded by the SIP in Mahwah, the location of NYSE which is the listing exchange for \\nBAC; while AAPL trades are sent to the SIP in Carteret, the location of NASDAQ which is the \\nlisting exchange for AAPL. The trades shown in the image are from the first few hundred \\nmicroseconds after the markets opened on February 5th, 2018, the day with the fourth highest \\nvolume in the last eight years. The straight paths represent messages from exchanges to the \\nrespective SIPs, while the circular paths represent messages that originated and terminated in the \\nsame location. Each trade is represented by a rectangle with its width proportional to the size of \\nthe trade (i.e., number of shares). The width of each path depicts the proportion of the number of \\ntrades currently passing through that path. Trades begin their journey at the exchange executing \\nthe trade and then move to their respective SIP location (i.e., listing exchange). The average time \\nthis takes is approximately 500s. While this is just the activity of two tickers, it illustrates that \\nall of the exchanges are producing trades and each link provides the necessary information for the \\nimmediate action of market participants. Any delay due to capacity constraints or service issues \\nwill therefore have an immediate impact on all subsequent activity. http://qnasdaqomx.com/WirelessConnectivity\\nhttp://anova-tech.com/sample-page/map/ xvii Figure 13. Visualization of messages passing between exchanges and to an observer Figure 14 depicts some of the dynamics of this system, which has irregular bursts of market \\nactivity and significant differences in speed. This figure is composed of a series of sequential \\nframes taken from the message visualization application. The sequence goes from left to right \\nthen top to bottom. In the first frame, top left, the market has just opened and trade messages for \\nAAPL from the exchanges start being sent to the SIP in Carteret. As in the previous figure, the \\nwidth of the rectangles represents the size of the trade. On the bottom of the second frame a large \\ntrade appears originating and terminating in Carteret and covering the width of the frame. Most \\nof the initial trades occurring away from Carteret reach Carteret by the 13th frame \\napproximately 230s after the market opening. Beyond the short sequence of events captured in \\nFigure 14, a dynamic depiction of the message flows via the visualization application shows \\nbursts of activity and message hopping where one can see some messages pass others at \\nsignificantly greater speeds on the same path a consideration for the development of the \\nrepresentational testing environment. xviii 26 https://www.sec.gov/marketstructure/midas.html Figure 14. Sequential frames from a video of market dynamics in action Data Source3.6\\nThe message level analyses in this report are derived from authoritative data from the same \\nsource from which the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gets their Market \\nInformation Data Analytics System (MIDAS) data26. This data comprises both the direct from all \\nthe exchanges as well as SIP data feeds for quote and trade messages. \\nThe intake of the data occurs in NASDAQs co-location facility its datacenter in Carteret, New \\nJersey. This co-location enables the data provider to add their own timestamp of when messages \\nwere received when they ingest the market feeds. Timestamps from the exchanges and the data \\nprovider are captured at the microsecond level. This additional timestamp provides further insight \\ninto market dynamics from the position of a market participant. https://www.sec.gov/marketstructure/midas.html xix Dynamic Data Behavior Impacts of High Traffic3.7\\nFigure 15 shows the number of times that a stock is apparently locked (i.e., a spread of 0) at the \\nSIP. This also gives a preliminary indication that increasing message traffic for a given asset \\nleads to more apparent locks in that asset. This suggests capacity and/or computational \\nconstraints on processing incoming messages. Figure 15. Number of SIP locks as a function of capacity The SIP crosses in Figure 16 indicates that as the number of quote messages increases there is an \\nincreasing number of apparent market crossings as seen at the SIP. In this figure, the price of the \\nstock is given in the color chart to the right. Stocks that trade for less than one dollar (i.e., penny \\nstocks, blue to blue-green in the figure) operate under different market rules and appear to follow \\na different relationship between number of messages and crosses. xx Figure 16. Number of SIP crosses as a function of capacity xxi Conclusions and Recommendations4\\nAs described in this technical report, HSSEDI developed a comprehensive, data map (i.e., a guide \\nto the mechanisms of the generation and flow of market activity data from one financial \\ninstitution to another across an entire subsector) of an essential subsector of the FSS, namely the \\ncapital markets. This data map provides a foundational component for an extensive testing \\nprogram in support of the NGCI Apex program. \\nThis technical report describes several analyses of the data dynamics within and between the \\nfinancial systems and infrastructure comprising the NMS. The analysis provides empirical \\nsupport to the nature of background traffic present in a highly active, highly valued, and highly \\nengineered sector of the financial system. Possible uses of this are for testing of red/blue \\nexercises focused on the financial sector. The findings presented here show that data flows range \\nfrom zero to millions of messages per second. Single messages, expressing transactions of \\nhundreds of thousands of dollars, may only be valid for such short times that capacity and \\ncomputational resources need to continually operate with high reliability. The analysis shows, \\nand gives the boundaries of, data activity that fluctuates across several orders of magnitude for \\nmany aspects of this system including day, time-of-day, asset, location, and message type. The \\ndata map, with its boundaries and structure, may inform real-time determinations of normal and \\nabnormal performance as well as ensure future FSS resiliency. Lastly, these analyses and the \\nensuing data map may provide a basis for workloads in the representational testing environment \\nfor the NGCI Apex Program.\\nFinally, HSSEDI concludes this report with a set of three recommendations for the NGCI Apex \\nprogram to enhance its representational testing environment. HSSEDI recommends that the NGCI Apex program expand this dynamic, data map into \\nan exhaustive depiction of workloads and time criticality for a small set of known market \\nevents (e.g., Flash Crash, Manic Monday and February 5th and 8th, 2018) when the \\nNMS",
