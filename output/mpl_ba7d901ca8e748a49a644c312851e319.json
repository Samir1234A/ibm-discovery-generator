  "sdl_extracted_summary": "largely to the overhead of the \\nconsensus process. One solution to increase the transaction speed of a blockchain is through the \\nuse of state channels. A state channel is a bi-directional channel between parties. Messages in the channel take the \\nform of transactions. Parties sign messages in the channel and anchor certain transactions to the \\nblockchain at specific checkpoints, making the series of interactions leading to the final \\ntransaction impossible to refute later. The majority of these transactions take place entirely off the blockchain and exclusively between \\nthe participants, meaning they are cheap and very fast to execute compared to on-chain \\npayments. (What are State Channels, 2016) 17 The open-source project Raiden Network (Raiden Network, 2017) has deployed initial support \\nfor state channels on Ethereum; however, current efforts are focused primarily on token \\ntransfers. 8.3 Bulk Data Storage \\nBlockchains are not designed to store large data. Information sharing within the enterprise will \\nrequire the ability to manage large data without directly storing it on the blockchain. One \\nalternative is to store large data in external decentralized storage such as the InterPlanetary File \\nSystem (IPFS) (IPFS Distributed Web, 2016) and use a hash fingerprint of the document in a \\ntransaction on the blockchain as a reference to the externally stored content. MITRE has \\nconducted initial experiments using this approach with moderate success. Other efforts, such as the BigchainDB (BigchainDB, 2017) project, are working to connect the \\nimmutability and decentralization of blockchain technology with traditional database technology \\nto create a best-of-breed approach for the enterprise. 8.4 Connecting Blockchains \\nAs more organizations deploy blockchain solutions there will be a need to allow multiple parallel \\nblockchains to interoperate. This can be difficult depending on transaction models and the \\nvarious consensus algorithms used by blockchains. Various open-source projects, such as Cosmos (Cosmos Whitepaper, 2017) and Polkadot \\n(Polkadot, 2017), are working on solutions to provide interoperability between blockchains, but \\ncurrent efforts are predominately focused on public blockchains. Conclusion \\nBlockchain technology is evolving at a very rapid pace. Understanding the core components of \\nthe technology and how they work together is critical to tracking the state of the art. While each \\ncomponent plays a critical role in the technology stack, consensus is at the heart of the system \\nand important to understand. Carefully choosing the right consensus algorithm based on the \\ndesired level of trust and security will be critical to a successful blockchain application. While public blockchains provide the most security as they are designed to operate in a trust-less \\nenvironment, government users will be most interested in a permissioned blockchain. However, \\nthe nature of a permissioned blockchain requires careful planning and governance to establish \\nthe parties participating in the consensus process. Without proper governance, there may be a \\npossibility of politically centralizing some of the key functionality of the blockchain, limiting its \\ncapabilities, and providing a false sense of security. As more look to permissioned blockchains to modernize traditional applications, there are \\nseveral requirements that need to be addressed. For example, privacy and confidentiality on the \\nblockchain, transaction scalability, and blockchain-to-blockchain connectivity. While theres \\nongoing active research in these areas across several open-source communities, permissioned \\nblockchains need to further evolve to fully meet the needs of the government user. 18 Bibliography \\nBigchainDB.

Delta Air Lines Flight DAL The (redacted) tail number of this aircraft included in the header information identified this report was generated by a Delta Air Lines Boeing 717. Inferred from this particular report is the AOC uplink request for this report (and other 717s) is likely REQFPN,TS.RP.FN. Examination of Delta Air Lines reports revealed their uplink requests appear to be tailored by aircraft type. For the small sample of reports in Figure A-1 the uplink request (REQFPN,RP) associated with both a Boeing 767 and 757s is different than that used for an Airbus A330 (REQFPN,FN.RP). As the Active Route (RP) request holds the desired message this aircraft variation can be ignored for MITRE CAASDs approach identification efforts. Ensuring MITRE CAASDs awareness of uplink request message variations is a useful discussion item during the airline agreement process. Airline uplink request tailoring may have unexpected impacts on data collection content and subsequent processing. A.1.2 General Electric 737 FMS Test Bed ACARS Reports To confirm the initial Delta Air Lines ACARS data set, MITRE CAASD executed similar request on the GE 737 FMS Test Bench with a known departure SID and the same Delta Air Lines STAR arrival and approach procedures. The uplink request /RP was replaced with a GE FMS /RI variation that produces identical content. The GE response shown in Figure A-3 A-4 matches the Delta Air Lines content but does contain some format differences along with the GE FMS departure information. These subtle ACARS variations must be accommodated in the data collection and processing steps. \\nFigure A-3. GE Test Bench Results using Delta Air Lines Flight Plan Sample /TS requested Time Stamp /RI requested Active Route response expanded: \\no :DA: departure airport KGSP \\no :AA: arrival airport KATL \\no :R: departure runway 04 and \\no (-) arrival runway identity (08L) \\no :D: departure procedure BIMMER1.ACERB (SID, transition) \\no :A: arrival procedure OZZZI1.DGESS (STAR, transition) \\no :F: flight plan segments (departure, arrival, missed approach hold) \\no :AP: approach procedure ILS 08L.LARII (procedure and transition) FN requested Flight Number response matched the programmed A.1.2.1 GE 737 FMS Test Bed ACARS Variation (POS) Position Report To further examine potential ACARS report variations the MITRE CAASDs GE 737 FMS Test Bench was programmed with a sample flight plan with departure, en route, and arrival elements and flown. Figure A-4 represents the two Control Display Unit (CDU) flight plan LEGS pages containing the flight plan departure legs. A-5 \\nFigure A-4. FMS Flight Plan LEGS pages with lateral waypoints and vertical constraints Replacing the ACARS the Flight Plan IMI request (FPN) with a Position Request (POS) is a relatively to simple change that will add the exact time and position of the response report downlink (REQPOS,RP request, position report, active plan). Figure A-5 shows both the ARINC 702A-1 standard definitions of the report and inflight POS response from the GE FMS. While the bulk of the downlinked message matches the ARINC standard definitions the GE FMS shows entries that have been customized. \\nFigure A-5. ARINC 702A format and GE FMS POSition Report Addressing these report anomalies to understand the airlines ACARS behaviors is necessary for MITRE CAASD to correctly interpret the report data. Regardless, the latitude, longitude, altitude and Greenwich GMT of the POS response clearly identifies the location and time this report was generated. Embedding that time and location as part of the report records can help manage analysis tasks as the data contains self-identifying content. As mentioned in Section 2.2, Delta Note: (right) ARINC 702A-1 format and (left) and POS header (blue text) and GE FMS output (black) A-6 Air Lines coordination meetings indicated their data operations reserved the POS report for dedicated purposes. Access or use of the POS request message was not acceptable for this initial MITRE CAASD effort. The use of position reports may not be a problem for future airline data collection agreements. Recognizing these data processing implementation details implies MITRE CAASDs data analysis must be able to compensate for airline collection agreements. The existing FPN format used for Delta Air Lines data intake designs may need, or benefit from adaptation for other airlines content. A.1.2.2 Other ACARS Downlink Content Not considered for this work but defined in the ACARS feature set are the Flight Plan History IEI (FH) and the Intent Data List (IDL) downlinks. When the FMS is programmed to respond to these requests the resulting information provides detailed internal FMS prediction and trajectory data shown in Table A-1. Table A-1. Flight History and Intent Data Content Figure A-6 shows both the Flight History and Intent Data List reported by the GE 737 FMS software. The columns with data headings for the Flight History correspond directly to the FMS CDU page information displayed to the pilots. There were no winds for this sample and altitudes are in 10s of feet (196 represents1960 feet). The Flight Plan History is derived from the state data used for by the FMS for its internal predictions. By downlinking that time, fuel, and wind information the ground side trajectory predictions may be improved. Use of the ETA values could be fed to scheduling algorithms for metering, RTA estimates, or interval management. Any use of this data must accommodate the fact that FMS predictions are dynamic so these values will vary as the flight progresses. The Flight Plan History reports fuel information (for aircraft weight estimates) is very useful for performance predictions but airlines may restrict access to that fuel use data. Airline data agreements regarding Flight History reports must consider competition sensitive data. Flight History Content \\n(predictions at waypoint) Intent Data Content ETA ETA Waypoint Name Waypoint Latitude Longitude Speed Altitude Altitude Fuel Temperature Waypoint Type (Lateral, Vertical) Wind Speed Lateral Turn Direction Wind Direction Lateral Turn Radius Airspeed Vertical T/C, T/D, Cross, Transition Procedure Indicator . Track to Next Waypoint . Distance to Next Waypoint A-7 In comparison the IDL report provides FMS trajectory data and with definitions in the ARINC 702A-1 characteristics could be used to recreate the three-dimensional version of the predicted flight path. Another potentially useful aspect of the IDL report is the identification of (RNP) RF legs in the flight plan. These points correspond to the CDU pages entries for ZONOK (370) and ZETEK (340) that indicate RF arc transitions at 3.7 and 3.4 nm respectively. \\nFigure A-6.
