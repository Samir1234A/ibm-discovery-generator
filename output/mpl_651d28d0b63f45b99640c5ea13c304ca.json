  "sdl_extracted_summary": "is not designed to be implemented in all conditions, so controllers will use their knowledge,\\nand automation support, as needed, to determine when IM operations should be conducted.\\nATC will still be responsible for appropriately sequencing and spacing aircraft prior to the\\ninitiation of IM. Such set-up can be conducted via current ATC capabilities or in more complex\\nenvironments with new capabilities. Set-up involves ATC issuing an IM clearance that either\\nuses speed adjustments alone, or a single turn and then speed adjustments. The IM clearance\\nincludes information such as lead aircraft identification, IM clearance type (e.g., achieve-by 2-5 then-maintain), ASG units (i.e., time or distance) and value (e.g., 90 seconds and 15 miles), and\\nIM special points (e.g., Achieve-By Point [ABP] and Planned Termination Point [PTP]). Once this information is provided to the flight crew, it is entered into the flight deck IM\\nequipment. The equipment checks that the appropriate information has been entered for the\\noperation and that the lead aircraft is in surveillance range. If the lead aircraft is not in\\nsurveillance range, the system continues to search. Once the aircraft is in range, is on the\\nexpected trajectory, and meets the necessary performance requirements, IM is initiated and\\nthe equipment starts providing information (primarily the speed to fly, termed IM speed).\\nSituation awareness information is also provided to assist the flight crew in monitoring the\\nprogression of IM. With the presentation of each new IM speed, the flight crew ensures that the IM speed is\\ncompatible with the aircrafts current configuration and environmental conditions. The flight\\ncrew is expected to follow the IM speeds in a timely manner consistent with other cockpit\\nduties unless other conditions (e.g., safety, operational, equipment, or regulatory issues)\\nprevent doing so. If any of these issues arise, the flight crew will maintain their last\\nimplemented IM speed and contact ATC to report being unable to conduct IM. Similarly, if ATC\\nhas any conditions that prevent continued IM operations, the controller will contact the flight\\ncrew and terminate or suspend IM. If the IM is suspended, the controller may choose to resume\\nIM at a later point, should the appropriate conditions exist. If no issues arise for either the\\ncontroller or the flight crew causing a suspension or termination, the flight crew continues\\nfollowing the IM speeds and the controller continues monitoring the operation until the aircraft\\nreaches the PTP. At this point, the flight deck IM equipment removes the IM speed from the\\ndisplay and IM is terminated. For additional information on the broader IM concept and preliminary requirements, see DO-\\n361 and DO-328A (RTCA, 2015a, 2015b). These documents describe near-term operations;\\nhowever, updates are being developed to enable more advanced operational implementations\\nsuch as dependent runway operations. For further details on the IM capabilities utilized in this\\nsimulation, see Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2. 2.2.2 IM Benefits\\nIM takes advantage of advances in technology to support current operations, and allows the\\ncontroller to delegate the low-level, tactical spacing task to IM capable aircraft. Controllers\\ncurrently try to achieve desired spacings by giving maneuver instructions to aircraft without the\\nflight crews necessarily having an understanding of the goals. Instead of simply being able to\\nassign a specific in-trail spacing goal, the controller has to provide several workload intensive\\ninstructions which include trial-and-error to determine the appropriate goal. By allowing flight\\ncrews to achieve or maintain an ASG, controllers may be able to more efficiently manage\\nmerging aircraft and improve throughput. The remainder of this section will review the benefits\\nmechanism and summarize related results from past IM activities. It will also highlight other\\nexpected benefits. 2-6 2.2.2.1 Throughput Benefits\\nIM is a relative spacing operation, in which trajectory corrections are made relative to real-time\\nbehavior of a lead aircraft (i.e., the lead aircrafts ATA). This is in contrast to an absolute spacing\\noperation, such as time-based metering, in which an aircraft is controlled to cross a specific\\npoint at a designated time. IM is a tactical tool and the spacing objective can be based on an\\nunderlying schedule, separation standard, or other operational need. In an absolute spacing operation, the error distribution of both aircraft must be considered\\nwhen setting the schedule and spacing goals. This is because both aircraft achieve the schedule\\nindependently and could contribute to a spacing that encroaches on the minimum separation\\nstandard. With IM, however, the error distribution of the lead aircraft does not need to be\\nconsidered because the IM Aircraft is correcting for it. Therefore, a spacing goal for an IM pair\\ncan be closer than would otherwise be possible with absolute spacing alone (e.g., TOAC or\\nterminal metering without IM). Figure 2-3 contrasts the error distributions that must be\\naccounted for in absolute (top diagram) and relative (bottom diagram) spacing operations. Figure 2-3. Absolute (Top) and Relative (Bottom) Spacing Operations Utilization of Aircraft\\nSpacing Error Distributions 2-7 With the spacing goal set, IM can further be used to improve spacing consistency and\\npredictability by enabling flight crews to make more frequent and efficient speed adjustments\\nthan are possible with ground-based metering and pilot-controller voice communications. This\\nis because airborne equipment can provide more speeds than the ground to make trajectory\\ncorrections. Also, since an aircraft will know its own trajectory more precisely than a ground\\nsystem, the speeds will be generated using better information and will thus be more efficient.\\nSetting, then achieving, a consistent, low-variance spacing interval reduces the time interval\\nbetween aircraft in a traffic flow, which allows each aircraft to be spaced closer to a given\\nseparation standard. This enables increased arrival throughput and sector or facility capacity. The performance metric used by the FAA to measure delivery benefits is termed Inter-Arrival\\nTime (IAT). The IAT is defined as the difference in time when two consecutive aircraft cross a\\ncommon point. For example, if a lead aircraft crosses the runway threshold at 12:30:30 and a\\ntrail aircraft crosses the runway threshold at 12:31:50, the IAT is 80 seconds. A population of\\nIATs will have a Standard Deviation (SD) associated with it, which indicates the extent of\\nvariations in the IAT. Assuming a normal distribution, one SD will include 68% of the range of\\nIATs in the population. Table 2-1 shows the assumed one IAT SD at the Final Approach Fix (FAF)\\nused to model benefits for different traffic management capabilities. Table 2-1. Metering Capabilities and the Associated IAT SDs Capability IAT SD\\nNo metering (baseline) 18.01 En route metering 16.52\\nGIM-S and TSAS 12.03 IM 5.04 1. Singha and Haines (1975) 2. Spinoso, Coville, and Roberts (2014) 3. Weitz (2017) 4. DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a) Ground-based Interval Management-Spacing (GIM-S) Each added capability in the first column of Table 2-1 reduces the IAT variance, which means\\nthat aircraft can be placed closer together relative to a separation standard (i.e., a lower\\nspacing goal can be used), without an increase in the number of controller interventions\\nneeded to avoid separation violations. 2-8 Figure 2-4 illustrates how IAT SD distributions relate to a separation standard. For example, if\\nthe IAT SD is 12 seconds as with GIM-S and TSAS, aircraft will need to be spacing with an IAT of\\napproximately 81 seconds to avoid an unacceptable number of controller interventions (as\\nshown in the magenta distribution1). If a controller tries to space aircraft closer together and\\nthe IAT SD is limited to 12 seconds, more controller interventions will be needed to prevent\\nseparation violations. However, if the IAT SD can be reduced to 5 seconds with IM (as shown in\\nthe red distribution), aircraft can be delivered at approximately 65 seconds with the same rate\\nof controller interventions as the 12-second IAT SD distribution. Figure 2-4. Various IAT SD Distributions Relative to the Separation Standard [Reprinted from Weitz, 2017] 1 The 81-second value is derived assuming a uniform flow, a minimum (time-based) separation of 53 seconds at\\nthe FAF, and a controller intervention rate of 1 per 100 operations.

(2005) demonstrated the benefit of accurate and low variance spacing when\\ncomparing an en route metering capability only, to one with IM (i.e., all the aircraft were IM\\ncapable). In the condition with IM, almost all aircraft were within 5 seconds of the ASG. The en\\nroute metering capability alone had a wider and flatter distribution shown in Figure 2-5. The IM\\ndistribution translated to an additional two aircraft per hour. Prevot et al (2007) found similar\\nresults where IM (70% of the aircraft) had a reduced mean and variance and allowed for an\\nadditional aircraft or two per hour (Figure 2-6). Figure 2-5.

  "text": "in hindsight [35] both as part of Defence market testing \\nand acceptance into initial service. If major capabilities outsource conduct of developmental and acceptance testing, \\nsafety assessments, usability trials and operating procedures to a contractor without adequate residential project staff \\nand representative operators present, then the transfer of risk and delay in resolving risk is contrary to the very intent of \\nthe project in giving these tasks to the contractor in the first place [5], [28], [32]. If the French Naval Group undertake significant portions of Australias submarine systems virtual, constructive and \\nlive simulation testing in France, significant Knowledge Transfer issues will make the flow of test results much harder. \\nSimilarly, if Lockheed Martin undertake the simulation testing of their submarine systems in the U.S., there are risks to \\ntest results making it unfettered to the stakeholders, especially if they were to use proprietary simulation models that \\nhave not been accredited by the U.S. and/or Australian DoD(s). Constraints on travel budgets hampered representation \\nof operators and technical experts on Australias Landing Helicopter Dock ship during safety and usability assessments \\nand that program only involved travel within Australia [32], [35], much less than would be the case for Cherbourg, \\nFrance and Rhode Island, U.S.. Cybersecurity assessments for cooperative vulnerability and penetration testing further \\nchallenge outsourcing of such work without close cooperation between the DoD and contractors [29], [36]. Work by \\nFowler et al. [37] shows there are extant Australian DoD practices like systems safety that can be leveraged to \\ncooperate with industry in independent cybersecurity, provided these practices are being followed and not overly \\noutsourced. Also, Joiner and Tutty [16] outline U.S. DoD initiatives to efficiently manage independent cybersecurity \\ntesting through distributed simulation, experimentation exercises and through the test network infrastructure on which \\nthese are based. For Australias Submarine Program, representative land-based test sites across all submarine systems should be \\nin Australia and under Australian DoD control as soon as possible if the design work is to be successfully exported in \\nan enduring way, enable knowledge sovereignty and provide for timely and informed decision making and taking [38]. \\nSuch test sites should significantly de-risk any such submarine program by helping to maintain public support, and \\nenabling fully representative technical and operational participation throughout the rolling complex software-intensive \\nsystems development in safety, usability [39], reliability, maintainability, availability and cybersecurity assessments. \\nCybersecurity has traditionally been considered as one of the ilities with tests focussed on mandatory compliance and \\nresponses to incidents during the operational phase of land-based tests, mostly as a reactive process, rather than for \\ndeveloping social trusts and assurances. Perspectives on how to build security in can establish a common language to \\nuse in designing the software-intensive systems, thus making risk trade-offs throughout projects acquisition lifecycles, \\nminimizing the number of systems vulnerabilities, and reducing time for land-based tests. Moreover, early investment \\nin representative land-based sites can be expected to add some up-front cost to the submarine program because they \\nentail high fidelity virtual and bench-level representations of the submarine systems in progressive upgrade ahead of all \\nfuture boats. As observed by the U.S DOD [27], the return on investment in test infrastructure can drive down acquisition costs, \\nbecause the technical debt, typically incurred because of flawed engineering and deferred testing, can be dramatically \\nreduced. Sovereign controlled land-based test sites will have additional workforce and National Security benefits. Land-\\nbased test infrastructure should provide fertile ground to grow and enhance local cybersecurity workforce. From a \\nNational Security perspective, this infrastructure would enable countries adopt agile, iterative and incremental \\nacquisition and testing approaches that ultimately enhance their sovereign ability to keep pace with adversaries in \\ncyberspace. Despite these lessons learned, land-based test sites like those in Australia are likely to face enormous pressure to be \\nscaled back, as they did on the Collins Program, in favour of foreign test sites and the actual build. Such pressure is \\nlikely to be a system-by-system argument, where for example, propulsion and power systems may get an Australian test \\nsite, but sonar, weapons, combat and communication systems remain foreign. Any such parsing of the submarine 4 systems puts enormous risk on the higher-order aim of any submarine program, on the actual submarines to resolve \\noperational and technical issues in-build and in-the-water rather than beforehand, and to become truly sovereign \\ncapabilities. In developing land-based test sites to enable live, virtual and constructive distributed simulations [16], it is \\ncrucial that the simulations are accredited for intended use, as is required in the U.S. Do D [40]. While such \\naccreditation seems a significant non-recurring expense, if the complex adaptive software elements and \\ninterconnectedness of the submarine exhibits emergent properties, as many modern defence systems are, then the quid \\npro quo of the test sites will be the wherewithal to begin software verification much earlier and continue that into life as \\ndetailed by Hecht [41], Normann [42] , and Cofer [43]. CYBER WARFARE THREAT AND OPPORTUNITYV.\\nCyber is becoming the cheap first-strike weapon of political choice by potential adversaries in a kind of merging of insurgency, terrorism, international crime and state-based influences [44]. The merging of electronic warfare and cyber-\\nwarfare means that no platform, however unconnected or firewalled it may be, is immune to probing within its systems \\n[14], [19]. A future submarine must not only survive and be credible in this Information Age, but actually ought to be a \\npotential purveyor of offensive cyber like that described by the Australian Prime Minister [12], so that it remains a \\ncontemporary deterrence. Cyber first and foremost is connected to the socio, meaning interfering with the socio-functioning of the system, for \\nexample by cyber-attacks, creating an instability in the synthetic ecology which interferes with the human psyche; \\ncreating further instability and uncertainty [22]. Sovereign Testing of the entire quantum attack surface is therefore \\nfundamental to Knowledge Transfer and cybersecurity, without which countries like Australia would not have \\nKnowledge Sovereignty over their future submarine. Cyber-power is relatively cheap, available and largely anonymous, such that it is attractive for peacetime as it is for \\nwar [45], especially for deterrence by smaller powers in the Asia-Pacific region [44]. These attributes also make cyber-\\npower attractive to non-state actors [13], [46] such as cyber criminals, terrorists, hackers, and proxy actors engaged or \\nsupported by numerous foreign governments [44, p.126], [47, p.5]. Heinl [44] forecasts that within a few years most \\nstates in the Asia-Pacific will develop some form of offensive cyber program , most of whom are also pursuing \\nsubmarine capabilities for deterrence [48]. Few Indo-Pacific countries pursuing these two defence capabilities are likely \\nto have examined the risk of cyber warfare to their new submarine capabilities because it is a delicate and futuristic \\nbalance of defensive and offensive new technologies [48]. While Australia often relies on deterrence by alliances, kinetic military power like that referred to by Hashim [49] \\ncan be unusable in cyber warfare because attribution is slow and difficult [50], [51], [52], cyber-effects are hard to \\ncontain, and the adversaries may be globally dispersed [53]. For Australias major military platforms like the future \\nsubmarine, which are intended to operate throughout the Asia-Pacific region, they are likely to be a cyber-warfare target \\nstarting from the first supply of software-intensive componentry for the test sites. The quantum attack surface for such \\nsubmarine programs are likely to be defined throughout their entire life by resupplies and software updates and every \\ncontractor and subcontractor with access. Defence acquisitions have sought to reduce costs and risks while improving interoperability for coalitions by \\nutilising commercial components, especially computer components and software applications. As such, most defence \\nplatforms probably have a larger cyber-attack surface than they realise [18]. The increased use of commercial hardware \\nand software to perform essential functions for mission critical systems is likely to have increased the vulnerability of \\ncountries like Australia to cyber-threats. Commercial components can be exposed to supply chain attacks as well as \\nmalicious tampering. Because re-use of commercial hardware and software is encouraged by international standards for \\ninteroperability [16], [54], [55], vulnerabilities are even more-likely to be discovered at some stage. Weapons Systems \\nwhich use commercial hardware and software are extensively interconnected with other platforms [17], which increases \\nthe quantum attack surface and cyber risks. Improving the dynamic (as in continuous and ongoing) cyber-resilience of defence platforms has three main threads \\nidentifiable from the U.S. DoD: improved security systems engineering and cybersecurity test and evaluation so as to design and build in cyber-\\nresiliency [14], [15] [27], [29]; trusted cyber supply chains as covered in the next section of this paper [17], [19]; and 5 trusted cyber-security modules or other resident cyber-threat adaptive sub-systems [19], [37].\\nTrusted cyber-threat adaptive modules have been the subject of recent review by the U.S. DoDs Defense Science Board [19], as these offer the ability to preserve cost-effective use of commercial off-the-shelf componentry but \\nmonitor and correct the use of such componentry with Defence-only add-ins to the architecture. The Boards proposal is \\nas follows (p. 93): Further work remains in optimizing methods for hardware- and software-based integrity validation, autonomous \\nassessment of subsystem compromise, and",
