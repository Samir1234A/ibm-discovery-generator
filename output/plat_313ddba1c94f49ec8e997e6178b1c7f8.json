  "text": "Aircrafts data block, the Final Approach controller provided the IM Trail Aircraft \\nits Assigned Spacing Goal once it and its lead were established on the final approach course. \\nThis initiated the IM PA operation and the Final Approach controllers then cleared the aircraft \\nfor their approaches and instructed the aircraft to change to the Local controller frequency. \\nFinal Approach controllers were responsible for providing IM PA separation for the short \\nduration of time between IM PA initiation and the aircraft change to the Local controller \\nfrequency. Monitor controllers then monitored separation with respect to the CSL and WSL (if \\napplicable) until the IM Lead Aircraft crossed its runway threshold. Previous research such as Mendolia, et al. (2016) examined the use of an expect message to \\nprovide IM Clearance information before the operation was intended to begin. Controller \\nresults suggested that clearance formulation in this manner was acceptable and during further \\nconcept development, was modified to the use of a Partial IM Clearance. The feasibility and \\nacceptability for Final Approach controllers to do this was examined with respect to multiple \\nmetrics. As the intent was the same and the sequence of communications and information \\ntransfers was similar to prior work involving expect, it was hypothesized that Final controllers \\nwould find the IM initiation task, including the use of Partial IM Clearance procedures, \\nacceptable. In the 28R Final controller position, controller participants on average agreed: Final controllers \\ncan acceptably initiate the IM PA operation and that their workload was low and acceptable. \\nThey also agreed on average that they were comfortable with the IM Trail Aircraft managing \\ntheir speeds to achieve the spacing goal while in their area, and that given the appropriate \\ntraining and tools, Final controllers can acceptably ensure separation during IM PA operations xi\\n before transferring aircraft to the Local controller. However, concerns were raised regarding the \\nphraseology, available CSL and WSL information at the time of initiation, and the available time \\nand airspace to perform the initiation task as simulated. Each of these concerns is discussed \\nnext. Communications. On average, controllers agreed it is operationally acceptable for the Final \\ncontroller to provide the IM PA spacing goal and that the IM PA spacing goal communication \\nwas acceptable. This suggests that the Partial IM Clearance procedures were acceptable to the \\nFinal controllers, though further research is recommended to examine Feeder controller \\nacceptability to provide the first part of the clearance. In a companion IM PA flight deck features \\nevaluation performed recently, pilots found these Partial IM Clearance procedures acceptable \\n(Lewis, Bone, Mendolia, & Nguyen, 2019). However, less than half of the pilots agreed it was \\nnecessary to split the clearance information into two messages. Domino, Tuomey, Stassen, & Mundra (2014) found IM PA initiation communications acceptable, \\nincluding the use of Expect to convey PA-related information early. In that HITL simulation, \\nhowever, the IM Clearance was conveyed with the IM PA 28R approach clearance and did not \\nrequire a separate communication. Controllers were required to provide the Lead Aircrafts \\nPFAS to the Trail Aircraft, which was not part of the IM PA initiation procedure for the \\nevaluation being reported on in this document. In the current simulation, the IM PA operation was initiated via a separate clearance and \\nfindings were consistent with the similar procedure used in Mendolia, et al. (2016). Though the \\nIM initiation procedure was generally acceptable, several comments in both evaluations noted \\nthe IM Clearance phraseology and procedures could be improved and streamlined, and some \\nspecific suggestions were made. In the current evaluation, one suggestion was the word Goal \\nshould be replaced with your interval spacing. Another suggestion was the Final controller \\nshould not have to repeat the IM Lead Aircrafts flight ID when providing the Assigned Spacing \\nGoal. Some controllers were observed to combine the Assigned Spacing Goal transmission with \\nthe approach clearance. The main concern about the communications appeared to be related to \\nthe number of required transmissions on the override frequency. This would be an important \\nconsideration for IM PA implementation at a facility, as discussed in Section 6.1. Finally, \\ncontrollers in both HITLs on average agreed they were comfortable with the use of the Lead \\nAircraft flight ID in the IM Clearance communication. IM PA Initiation Information. On average controllers agreed they had the necessary display \\nelements to provide the appropriate IM Clearance information to the trail aircraft in an IM PA \\npair. However, many controllers commented on the need for more predictive information, \\nearlier. The simulation procedure required the Final controller to first issue the IM Clearance \\nand then receive acknowledgement from the IM Trail Aircraft before accepting the proposed \\nclearance in the IM Spacing List and activating the IM PA display features. This was designed to \\nreduce the potential for controllers to accept the clearance in the automation, but potentially \\nget distracted and fail to follow up and actually issue the IM Clearance to the Trail Aircraft. This \\nwould result in a situation where the automation is displaying an IM PA operation was being \\nperformed, when in reality the candidate IM Trail Aircraft is not following IM Speeds to manage \\nits spacing. xii\\n In the simulation, however, controllers expressed concerns this procedure did not allow them to \\nknow the IM Trail Aircrafts proximity to the safety limits before issuing the IM Clearance. This \\nwas exemplified by a scenario event in which a candidate IM Trail Aircraft was ahead of its CSL \\nat the time of initiation. This was not displayed to the Final controllers, so they received a \\nCaution Alert as soon as they accepted the IM Clearance in the IM Spacing List and then \\nimmediately had to terminate. To avoid this, controllers suggested adding a CSL Preview line \\non the display to indicate where the IM Trail Aircraft was relative to the CSL before controllers \\nneeded to provide the IM Clearance. This would enable a Tower controllers request for the \\nability to adjust speeds prior to the start of IM PA to increase the probability of the Trail Aircraft \\nachieving its spacing. The suggestion was also made for a WSL-P to be displayed before \\ninitiation; however, this may prove confusing and counterproductive as discussed in Section 6.1. Initiation Time. On average controllers agreed once the IM Trail Aircraft joined the final, they \\nhad sufficient time and airspace to initiate IM PA before transferring the aircraft to the Local \\ncontroller. However, comments and discussion suggested this portion of the operation could be \\nimproved over what was implemented in the simulation. One controller suggested a Final \\ncontroller should have more airspace to adjust the initial spacing if needed. This controller \\nagreed with another controller who suggested a fix with an above crossing altitude. This would \\nallow the Final controller to clear for the approach, then assign the spacing goal once \\nestablished on final. The participant suggested this would make the timing less critical. Another \\ncomment suggested they could better ensure they were transferring appropriately separated \\naircraft to the Local controller if the IM Trail was in their area for a longer period following \\ninitiation. i\\n Conclusions and Recommendations8\\nSummary of Conclusions8.1 The FAA, NASA, MITRE CAASD, and others have been conducting research on various aspects of \\nPA for over two decades. In 2016, RTCA SC-186 WG 4 decided to make PA an IM application and \\ninclude it in the updated FIM Equipment requirements. Through this process, stakeholders \\ndetermined controllers must be able to monitor the operation relative to a separation standard. \\nThis requires controllers to be able to assess separation within an IM PA pair and take effective \\naction before separation is lost. Therefore, the IM PA concept was changed to move the safety \\nlimit monitoring function from being a flight crew responsibility and FIM Equipment capability \\nto a ground capability. Sponsored by the FAAs SBS Program Office, MITRE CAASD developed and executed a HITL \\nexperiment to validate IM PA concept changes, address open controller acceptability and \\nfeasibility questions, provide input to air and ground system requirements, and mitigate \\ntechnical risks associated with the revised PA concept. The primary goal of this HITL simulation \\nwas to examine new controller monitoring functions. This included an evaluation of the \\nterminal controller monitoring task for IM PA aircraft pairs established on final approach, \\nespecially with respect to both minimum and maximum separation values that change over the \\ncourse of the approach, and lateral deviations. Additionally, it examined the acceptability of a \\nsingle monitor controller to manage Lead and Trail Aircraft, or whether separate monitors \\nshould be required. The experiment also included an evaluation of prototype display features to \\nfacilitate this monitoring task. A secondary goal was to examine acceptability and information \\nrequirements for IM PA initiation. After initiating and monitoring IM PA operations with varying supporting IM PA (display) Tool \\nconfigurations, monitor configurations, and off-nominal deviations, results suggest given the \\nappropriate tools and training, the IM PA longitudinal and lateral separation monitoring task \\nshould be feasible and acceptable to controllers. IM PA pair-wise separation assurance \\nappeared to be a straightforward task for controllers as only a",
