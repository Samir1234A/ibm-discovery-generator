Most controllers reported a Final Monitor controller is the most appropriate position to monitor \\nIM PA operations, though this may ultimately depend on the facility. They also expressed a \\nstrong preference to provide speeds manually to the IM Trail Aircraft when they observed a \\nspacing situation start to develop. However, the practicality of this may depend on whether a \\nFinal Approach controller or dedicated Monitor controller is providing separation within and \\nbetween IM PA pairs. Controller manual PA speed management must be balanced with the \\npotential for undesirable frequency overrides and workload, which may make it highly \\nchallenging to implement. With respect to the experiments secondary goal to evaluate the IM PA initiation task, controller \\nparticipants on average agreed Final controllers: can acceptably initiate the IM PA operation; \\ncan acceptably ensure separation during IM PA operations before transferring aircraft to the \\nLocal controller given the appropriate training and tools; and were comfortable with the IM \\nTrail Aircraft managing speed to achieve the spacing goal. However, concerns were raised \\nregarding the phraseology, available CSL and WSL information at the time of initiation, and the \\navailable time and airspace to perform the initiation task as simulated. Overall results suggest given the appropriate tools and training, the IM PA longitudinal and \\nlateral separation monitoring and initiation tasks should be acceptable to controllers. In a \\nrelated IM PA flight deck features evaluation performed in 2018, pilots also found IM PA to be \\ngenerally acceptable, even after experiencing significant lateral deviations by the Lead Aircraft. \\nThe current IM PA concept appears feasible and MITRE CAASD recommends the FAA continue \\nits development. vi\\n This study provided initial findings on the initiation and monitoring of an IM PA operation. The \\nresults are intended to provide concept validation for the avionics standard development \\nactivities and A-IM Concept of Operations, as well as specific recommendations for the FAA IM \\nInitial Program Requirements document with respect to controller information needs and \\nsupporting ground tools. These results and recommendations should be considered by RTCA SC-\\n186, FAA SBS Program Office, FAA Aircraft Certification, and FAA Flight Standards as IM PA \\nproceeds through concept maturation. vii\\n Acknowledgments\\nThis research was sponsored by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Surveillance and \\nBroadcast Services (SBS) Program Office (AJM-432).
