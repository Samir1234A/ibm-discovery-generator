On the one hand we need to agree and \\nestablish in international law acceptable scientific methods, ethical norms, and \\ncommercial standards; on the other hand, we need to recognize that some \\ngovernments, and powerful individuals within those governments, will flout them \\nanyway. There is no single agency in the US government, or any international body, that \\nowns the bio threat. This leaves the US wide open to nefarious actors, just as it \\nleaves the civilized world vulnerable to the malevolent, violent, and absent \\nminded. The confluence of uncharted technical capability and poor prediction is \\nespecially serious now, because for the first time we have the capability not only \\nto destroy ourselves on a nuclear scale, we might accidentally change the \\nstructure of our embedded software species-wide. The first experiments of so-\\ncalled germline embryos occurred in China. They were well intended. Soon \\nenough they will be successful, and fall into the hands of less altruistic \\ncommunities. The consequences are even more tragic and destabilizing than a \\nsuicide bomber who kills children (as incomprehensible as that is); genetic \\nchanges are heritable, persistent, and may be impossible to undo. Sonal Shah, the executive director of the Beeck Center for Social Impact and \\ninnovation at Georgetown University, said the convergence of AI with \\nbiotechnology is one of the most important social consideration of our times, on \\npar with global warming. This is an important point, because from the scientific \\nperspective, the case of carbon dioxide loading is well decided.6 General John R. \\nAllen, who commanded coalition forces in Afghanistan, told us that the \\nDepartment of Defense is investing in technologies that lower our carbon \\nfootprint and obviate climate change. We know how to model the security \\nimplications of increasing temperatures, he said, but the ethical considerations \\nof autonomous systems deciding who to kill in a robot war are new and \\nundecided. LaPoint and Levin made a similar point last year in these pages.7 There are plenty of examples of our collective inability to cooperate when the \\nphysical evidence is clear, for instance in contaminated water, depleted fishstock \\nand inexorably rising tides. The existential threat of AI-driven biotechnology is \\nabstract to most people, including highly educated policymakers of every color, Schnitzer and Levin Page 6 of 8\\nThe Hope and Challenge of Synthetic Biology December 12, 2017 8 Peter L. Levin is a member of the board of this non-profit, non-partisan foundation. creed, culture, and continent. But knowhow, like the atmosphere, neither \\nconforms to nor respects international borders. There are five decisions to make. First and foremost, we will implicitly choose whether or not to address these \\ndiscussions openly, transparently, authentically, and democratically. We have \\nalready ceded a years-long head start to our friends, rivals, and enemies, primarily \\nbecause of restrictions on stem-cell research. They are making dramatic progress \\nin artificial intelligence and bio-engineering. So, first, we need to decide to decide. Second, assuming a more pro-active and deliberate process, the US government \\nneeds to dramatically increase funding into the overlapping disciplines of bio-\\nengineering and machine learning. There are, of course, undeniable benefits to \\nan ageing society with a paucity of primary-care physicians. Superior pattern-\\nmatching capabilities and front-line decision support to human clinicians will \\nimprove quality, lower costs, extend resources, and change lives for the better. \\nPedro Domingos of the University of Washington expects that AI will help screen \\ndrugs for toxicity much faster than human trials. He said, We know that some \\nmedicines may be poison to most people, but can save the lives of a small group \\nof patients; we can use machine learning to safely reach those who will benefit. The most dire need for focused research is in the area of dementia and \\nAlzheimers. George Vradenburg, founder of the non-profit USAgainstAlzheimers8 \\nestimates that the global cost to support Dementia victims already exceeds $1 \\ntrillion, over 1% of global GDP, and is increasing at an accelerating rate. Ironically, \\nnowhere is the need for advances in computer discovery more acute than human \\ncognition and rational behavior. Third, we need to protect what we discover. We blithely live in the shoals of a \\nrelentless tsunami of breached personal data. This is a gigantic mistake. Our \\nprofligate attitude towards cybersecurity is going to migrate from personal \\ninconvenience to economic intrusion, and from intrusion to physical incursion. We \\nhave lit up a fog-shrouded runway for our competitors and adversaries to land on; \\nthey will not need an invitation to take the next step. So much of societally \\nbeneficial innovation was born in the United States from satellite navigation to \\nsemiconductor design, and from advanced industrial materials to HIV therapies Schnitzer and Levin Page 7 of 8\\nThe Hope and Challenge of Synthetic Biology December 12, 2017 9 The Master Algorithm, by Pedro Domingos, published in 2015 by Basic Books but we controlled, to a greater or lesser extent, when and how they were \\ndeployed. At this point not only do our rivals have a jump, they have an \\nasymmetric advantage because they can see what we are, and are not, doing. Fourth, the United States needs to be keenly aware of the research and \\ndevelopment efforts of other countries. Some intelligence gathering will \\ninevitably fall on the shoulders of clandestine operations. Some requires more \\nstructured and pro-active engagement with globally-minded scientists from other \\nnations, where academic collaboration and technical trust trump selfish \\ncommercial impulses (or clumsy friends) that may have detrimental or what we \\ntoday perceive as detrimental effects on national security and economic \\ncompetitiveness. Finally, the most difficult question of all: how much should we share? The \\nconvergence of scientific discovery (based on advances in the creation and \\nconstruction of bio-mimicking processes), technological capability (based on \\nadvances in AI and ML), and ethical judgment (based on verifiable truthful and \\nfact-based information) can lead to a richer, more peaceful world, or to horrible \\nconflagration. There will be tremendous commercial advantage to the companies, \\nand the nation-states that host or sponsor them, who master the science and \\ntechnology of the 21st century. Left to their own devices, their human values and \\npolitical goals will inevitably permeate not just consumer choice, but seats of \\ngovernment. Clearly there is a case for thoughtful dialog, for investment, for \\nprotection, and for nourishing communities of aligned and common interests. Domingos9 wrote, The real story of automation is not what it replaces but what it \\nenables. Technologies that touch the genome shift the ethical, commercial, and \\nglobal security paradigm in ways that are unprecedented in human history. \\nHowever, unless and until we honestly, scientifically, and transparently approach \\nthe governance of our new-found powers, we need not fear cyborg domination \\nany time soon, no, just the people who control them.
