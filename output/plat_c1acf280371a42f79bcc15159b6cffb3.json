  "text": "mitigations can be applied to reduce the ARC level \\n[22]. There can be strategic mitigation and tactical mitigations, as depicted in Figure 3-6. 3-6. SORA Air-Conflict Mitigation Process Assignment of SAIL from Air Collision Risk: Using a look up table, the Air-SAIL is 4.\\nmapped directly from the final (i.e., mitigated) ARC level, as indicated in Table 3-2. xvi\\n Table 3-3. Air-SAIL Values Based on Assessed Air Risk Class Final ARC Air-SAIL\\nARC 4 SAIL VI\\nARC 3 SAIL IV\\nARC 2 SAIL II\\nARC 1 SAIL I Determination of Uncontained Integrity Level: Depending on the ARC level, further 5.\\nassessment is made on based on the intended proximity to adjacent airspaces with higher \\nAEC levels. Uncontained integrity levels needed for the phases of flight or flight \\nsegments that are adjacent to sensitive/restricted airspaces [22]. The definition of \\nadjacent is subjective.\\nTactical Mitigation Performance Requirement (TMPR) and Robustness Levels: 6.\\nThese indicates the level of the aircrafts ability to avoid collisions with obstacles (See \\nand avoid capabilities) and to avoid conflicts with other aircraft (conflict detection \\ncapabilities). Flights operating with visual line of sight do not need to meet TMPR \\nrobustness levels; whereas BVLOS operations need to meet the TMPR and robustness \\nlevels [22]. The TMPR and robustness levels are used as the basis of requirements of the \\noperator to meet for approval. The SORA guidance provides Annexes that give more specific information for each of these \\nsteps for determining the AIR-SAIL. Refer to ANNEX G, the Air Risk Model, for more detailed \\ninformation. 4 i\\n Conclusions and Recommendations5\\nIn summary, quantitative risk modeling methods require all model components to be numerically \\nquantified and their output to be a numerical value which reflects a physical quantity. In contrast, \\nqualitative models allow both quantitative and qualitative inputs. Risk may be calculated by a \\ncombination of methods, including numerical equations, inference rules (if-then), lookup tables \\n(SMS matrices), and many other methods [23]. The principal differences are the explicit \\nalgorithm of a quantitative probabilistic model versus the flexibility and broader subjective inputs \\nand qualitative output of a qualitative model. Model precision is based on the completeness and \\ncomprehensiveness of the input variables, as well as the quality, timeliness, and utility of the data \\nthat is used for the inputs. \\nBased on the evaluation that follows, it is recommended that the FAA: Come to agreement on standardized safety thresholds and acceptable levels of risk to 1.\\nguide sUAS risk assessments.\\nUse a holistic review process such as the SORA (once finalized) or the FAA SMS 2.\\nassessment processes for those operations in the higher risk categories and/or with a \\nrequired need for increased oversight.\\nInvest in the development of semi-automated functions when the SORA methodology is 3.\\nfinalized and standardize the wide variety of inputs and integration of standardized safety \\nthresholds. \\nConsider using the sAAT model to identify the operations with the lowest risk. These 4.\\noperations could be approved without further analysis. This may help streamline the \\napproval process by reducing the number of applications that need more rigorous \\nevaluation. \\nConsider using the sAAT risk model to explore thresholds for acceptable levels of safety 5.\\nby examining the most sensitive parameters. Perform research to refine model parameter \\nvalues and integrate and expand industry operational data. i\\n References/Bibliography6\\n[1] T.
