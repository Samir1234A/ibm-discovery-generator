However, it has been shown that QKD systems are vulnerable to side channel attacks due to engineering and technical imperfections in practical implementations. This article presents a general overview of quantum cryptography, beginning with a comparison of classical and quantum cryptography is threatened by quantum computing. A basic discussion of QKDs security characteristics and implementation details is given. An example side channel attack is introduced with the avalanche photodiode backflash attack. The authors provide a brief overview of their experiment to investigate this attack, and report results indicating the ability for this attack to, in principle, succeed. brodenburg@mitre.org The authors affiliation with The MITRE Corporation is provided for identification purposes only, and is not intended to convey or imply MITREs concurrence with, or support for, the positions, opinions or viewpoints expressed by the authors.

Case Number 18-0968 mailto:brodenburg@mitre.org 1 Introduction Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises a theoretically unbreakable cryp- tosystem by employing the probabilistic nature of quantum measurement over mutually unbiased bases. Its security lies in the impossibility of an eavesdropper to gain access to the quantum keys without revealing the eavesdroppers presence due to the destructive nature of quantum measure- ment, as measured by the quantum bit error rate (QBER) [1]. However, it has been shown that QKD systems possess security vulnerabilities due to engineering and technical imperfections in practical implementations. Side channel attacks exploiting various points of accidental information leakage have been described in the literature, with examples including the photon number splitting and faked states attacks [1, 2, 3]. Many of those systems employ avalanche photodiodes (APDs) as a part of the process of measuring photon states to create a secure key as described by QKD protocols like BB84 [1]. Avalanches of charge carriers following photodetection events in silicon and InGaAs APDs are known to emit sec- ondary photons as a consequence of carrier relaxation [4, 5]. These photons, or backflashes, may be coupled back into the quantum channel and detected by an eavesdropper who could potentially deduce the states of the origi- nal information-carrying photons measured by the legitimate QKD receiver without affecting the QBER and thus remain hidden [6, 7]. 2 Quantum Cryptography 2.1 The One-Time Pad Many encryption systems varying in complexity and security have been invented. However, in the context of quantum cryptography the one-time pad plays an important role. The principle behind this cryptosystem (also known as the Vernam cipher) is simple, yet it is extremely effective at securing information [9]. Suppose we have a system where we assign a numerical value to each letter in the alphabet: Letter A B C \\n1\\n 2\\n(|H+ |V ) = 1\\n 2\\n(|0+ |1) |+ (1) |A \\n1\\n 2\\n(|H |V ) = 1\\n 2\\n(|0 |1) | . (2) So, prior to creating each photon qubit, Alice chooses a random polarization basis (HV or AD). She records this information. Then, she creates the pho- ton with a random polarization state within that basis. She also records this polarization state and its associated bit value. Note that upon measurement |H and |D correspond to bit 0 and |V and |A correspond to bit 1. Thus, each photon that Alice creates has a random polarization state with a 25% probability of being |H, |V , |A, or |D. She then transmits the qubit to Bob via their optical fiber cable. 2. Bob receives the qubits from Alice and measures them Upon receiving the photons from Alice, Bob measures their polarization states to begin the process of creating a secret key. As follows from the 5 basic principles of quantum mechanics, the basis that Bob uses for his measurements will affect their outcome. For each photon that Bob receives, he randomly chooses either the HV or AD basis, and performs the measurement. He records his basis choices and measurement results in the form of random bits. 3. Alice and Bob compare results As the final step in the BB84 protocol, Alice and Bob indirectly compare their random bits to obtain a sifted key. Alice announces to Bob over an insecure classical channel her random basis choices while keeping secret her state choices. Bob looks at his basis choices, and tells Alice which photons had Alice and Bob choosing the same basis, and which had a basis mismatch. Bob communicates this information to Alice over the insecure classical channel, keeping secret his measurement outcomes. Alice and Bob then agree to keeping measurements when their measurement basis matched, and discarding all other measurements. This step is significant because in keeping only the photons for which Bob knows he used the same basis as Alice, he can be certain that the random bit resulting from his measurement is exactly the same random bit that Alice obtained when randomly choosing a polarization state prior to photon transmission, due to the nature of quantum measurement. So the BB84 protocol allows Alice and Bob to create two sets of sifted keys of random bits that they know are identical just by comparing basis choices so that their actual random bits remain secret. As a result, Alice and Bob now share a string of random bits that they can use as their secret key for the proved-secure one-time pad procedure as discussed earlier. Note that the one-time pad also works with strings of random bits [9, 12]. Suppose Alice uses an encoding system to convert her secret alphanumerical message to the binary string 10111001. The secret key that she shares with Bob might be 11001101. She performs bitwise modulo-2 sum (XOR) with her message and the secret key to encrypt it: 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 Upon receiving the encrypted message from Alice, Bob can perform another bitwise modulo-2 sum using the shared secret key to decrypt the message: 6 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 There are additional error correction and privacy amplification protocols that Alice and Bob can perform to increase the secrecy and accuracy of their secret key, at the expense of reducing the number of bits in the key. The majority of those protocols are classical, and take place after the transmission of information through the quantum channel [1]. Key distribution via QKD has been proved theoretically secure against all attacks due to the probabilistic nature of quantum measurement. Any attempts by an eavesdropper to secretly measure the quantum bits mid- transmission will irrevocably alter those quantum states such that Alice and Bob will be aware that their quantum bits have been tampered with by measuring the QBER. Even with a quantum computer an eavesdropper can- not non-destructively measure or clone quantum states due to the quantum no-cloning theorem [17]. 4 QKD Implementation In addition to the well-known BB84 protocol, researchers have developed a number of alternative protocols. Some of them are variations of BB84, with differences in procedures and states used [1]. For instance, the E91 protocol, introduced by Arthur Ekert in 1991, involves creating entangled pairs of photons (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen states) at a central source and sending each photon to Alice and Bob for measurement [19]. Due to the variety of available QKD protocols and two-state quantum systems, there are countless possible approaches to implementing QKD. Each has its own unique design corresponding to the requirements of the protocol and the use case, and comes with its own strengths and weaknesses in terms of QBER tolerance thresholds, key generation rate, feasibility, and other factors. For instance, while in the previous chapter we considered a general polarization-based implementation of BB84 using optical fibers, it is also possible to implement BB84 using photon phase and frequency encoding [1]. Additionally, one is not restricted to the use of optical fibers for qubit transmission; free-space QKD where photons are transmitted kilometers through the atmosphere along a shared line of sight have been demonstrated [20]. Commericial QKD systems are currently available for purchase, with many field tests conducted in recent years proving their feasibility [22, 23]. 7 4.1 Exploiting Implementation Flaws In the ideal QKD implementation, guaranteed security against eavesdroppers relies on the assumption that only idealized equipment is used where every component functions precisely as expected. However, real-world implementa- tions tend to be far from ideal due to a variety of technical and engineering challenges. Such implementation flaws could significantly threaten the secu- rity of QKD as they offer side channel exploitation opportunities for Eve to increase her eavesdropping abilities without detection [1]. An example of a side channel attack is the backflash leakage attack, which exploits",
