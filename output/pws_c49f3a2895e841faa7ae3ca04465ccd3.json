  "text": "Figure reprinted \\nfrom: Bone and \\nMendolia (2018) xxiv\\n Figure 2-16. Prototype IM Information in Data Block, IM Lead Aircraft from Bone and Mendolia (2018) The researchers reported that when asked whether the information in the IM Spacing List was \\nhelpful for IM, the majority of controllers agreed that in general, the IM elements were helpful \\nfor IM operations / Aircraft. Controllers also specifically found the IM Status information to be \\nhelpful for IM operations / Aircraft. For the data block IM elements, IM Trail Aircraft and IM Lead Aircraft status indicators were \\nreported as helpful by a majority of controllers. Controllers appeared to favor maintaining the \\ndisplay of IM Status in the data block and not just in the IM Spacing List. They did not want IM \\nStatus to be removed from the data blocks near and on final. Figure reprinted \\nfrom: Bone and \\nMendolia (2018) i\\n Research Goals, Questions, and Hypotheses4\\nIM PA Concept Evolution and Research Gaps4.1 The Legacy PA concept evaluated in the HITL experiments described in Section 2.4 assumed \\nthat safety limit monitoring would be a responsibility of the airborne equipment and flight \\ncrews. The controllers role was to establish alternate separation in the event of a PA Equipment-\\ncommanded breakout. As PA began to be incorporated into the FIM Equipment standards \\nprocess in RTCA, stakeholders determined that the concept needed to change to ensure that \\ncontrollers explicitly maintain separation responsibility and therefore must be able to monitor \\nthe operation relative to a clear separation standard. This requires controllers to be able to \\nassess aircraft pair PA separation such that they can take effective action before separation is \\nlost. The flight crew task should become speed guidance conformance, as with the other IM \\napplications. Therefore, the concept was changed to move the safety limit monitoring function \\nfrom being a flight crew responsibility and FIM Equipment capability to a ground capability, \\nlikely to be hosted in STARS. The updated IM PA concept introduces two new aspects to the controller separation assurance \\ntask. First, controllers today typically monitor aircraft against a single minimum separation \\nvalue. With IM PA, however, controllers will likely be required to monitor some aircraft parings \\nwith respect to a minimum limit (CSL) and a maximum limit (WSL). Second, current separation \\nminima are usually static; i.e., they are a known value that remains fixed for a given set of \\nconditions. For IM PA, however, the distance allowed between the aircraft and both limits will \\nchange as a function of the distance to the runway, as illustrated in Figure 2-4. Due to IM PAs minimum and maximum safety limits that change over the course of an \\napproach, and the close inter-aircraft pair distances, stakeholders expected that controllers \\nwould likely require new ground tools to detect and act on potential exceedances of the safety \\nlimits. Also, these tools would be required to allow controllers to provide a timely response to \\nan aircraft deviation in either the longitudinal (along-track) or lateral (i.e., blunder) dimensions. \\nNeither the new monitoring task and nor the potentially enabling tool set has yet been \\nexamined in a HITL environment. In addition, due to flight crew workload in preparing the FIM Equipment, nominal IM PA setup \\nshould be possible in en route or feeder airspace, possibly via a Partial IM Clearance (as \\ndescribed in Section 2.2.1). Although prior PA ATC research assumed the use of an expect \\nmessage to provide setup information before the operation was to begin (see Section 2.4), the \\nuse of a Partial IM Clearance as described in FAA (2017b) and RTCA (2019a) to prepare an IM PA \\noperation has not yet been examined in a HITL activity. Research Goals4.2\\nPrior PA HITL research such as Domino, Tuomey, Stassen, & Mundra (2014) and Mendolia, et al. \\n(2016) examined controller tactical setup and separation monitoring as a flight crew \\nresponsibility. The results regarding tactical setup are expected to still be generally relevant to \\nthe IM PA concept as currently defined. Therefore, the primary goal of this HITL was to examine \\nthe updated IM PA concept with a focus on the new controller monitoring functions. This ii\\n included an evaluation of the terminal controller monitoring task for IM PA pairs established on \\nfinal, especially with respect to minimum and maximum separation limits that change over the \\ncourse of an approach. Related to this is whether it is acceptable for a single monitor controller \\nto manage IM Lead and IM Trail Aircraft on both approaches, or whether separate monitors \\nwould be required. It also included an evaluation of alternative supporting display features to \\nfacilitate this monitoring task. A secondary goal was to examine the use of a Partial IM \\nClearance procedure to initiate IM PA operations on final. This HITL experiment was not intended to comment on the feasibility of tactical or metering IM \\nPA setup procedures, beyond having the Final Approach controller initiate the operation, nor \\nwas it intended to precisely replicate SFO airspace and operations and draw specific conclusions \\nwith respect to a mature IM PA implementation at that facility. Additionally, this HITL did not \\nsuggest any final design criteria with respect to a future PA separation standard or any final IM \\nPA ground tool interface or display requirements (although recommendations are made for \\nconsideration by the appropriate design groups). The results of the HITL are intended to provide concept validation for the avionics standard \\nactivities and A-IM ConOps, as well as specific recommendations for the FAA IM Initial Program \\nRequirements document with respect to controller information needs and supporting ground \\ntools. Research Questions and Hypotheses4.3\\nBased on the research goals and past studies, six research questions and corresponding \\nhypotheses were developed. These are listed below: RQ1: Is it feasible and acceptable for controllers to monitor PA separation with respect to \\nboth minimum and maximum separation limits? The controller separation assurance task includes spacing and separating among in-trail aircraft \\nwithin flows and on approaches. In these situations, controllers today must ensure that a given \\naircraft maintains appropriate spacing from an aircraft ahead as well as an aircraft behind. \\nThough IM PA introduces a minimum and maximum limit with respect to a single leading \\naircraft, the task of keeping an aircraft within a forward and aft boundary should be a simple \\nextension of this basic controller task. Therefore, it is hypothesized that controllers will find IM \\nPA safety limit monitoring both feasible and acceptable. H1(RQ1): Given an appropriate tool set, controllers will find it acceptable and feasible to monitor \\nIM PA operations with respect to both minimum and maximum separation limits. RQ2: Is it feasible and acceptable for controllers to provide PA separation with respect to \\nvalues that change over the course of an approach? Controllers today have experience with separation minima that can change for a given pair of \\naircraft depending on conditions. For example, an aircraft pair turning onto final may initially be \\nseparated via Minimum Radar Separation (MRS) of 3 NM or 1000 ft vertical. Then, when aircraft \\nare within 10 NM of the airport on final, pairs may be allowed to close to 2.5NM per Section 5-5-\\n4 in FAA (2017a). In another example, at certain facilities aircraft may be transitioned to a \\n7110.308C operation and allowed to close to within 1 NM diagonal (FAA, 2018b). Aircraft \\nseparation on approach may be further complicated at some facilities due to MRS applying to iii\\n certain aircraft pairs and new Wake Recategorization (RECAT) Separation minima required for \\nother combinations (FAA, 2016). Controllers are therefore used to managing complexity in \\napplying the appropriate separation standards to pairs of aircraft. However, clear rules are \\nrequired to govern which standard applies for any given aircraft pairing, operation, and set of \\nconditions. A PA separation standard should therefore also be manageable, even if it changes over the \\ncourse of an approach, as long as the required separation distance minimum is clear at any \\ngiven time and the trend is generally predictable. As this can be incorporated in the design of a \\nground tool, it is therefore hypothesized that if done correctly, controllers can find it acceptable \\nand feasible to provide PA separation with respect to separation values that change over the \\ncourse of an approach. H2(RQ2): Given an appropriate tool set, controllers will find it acceptable and feasible to provide \\nPA separation with respect to separation values that change over the course of an approach. RQ3: What information elements and tools may be required for Monitor controllers to \\nlongitudinally monitor IM PA operations? As described above, it is expected that controllers will need to know the required separation \\ndistance for an IM PA pair at any given time. This may be in the form of a graphical indicator or \\nnumeric indicator. It is hypothesized that one form will be required by controllers, but not both. \\nIn addition, to ensure the acceptability of a standard that involves limits that change over the \\ncourse of an approach, the changes must be generally predictable and manageable. As the WSL \\nonly applies to certain aircraft pairings, and even then, only in the last portion",
