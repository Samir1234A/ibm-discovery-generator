C-1 Appendix C Post-Simulation Questionnaires C.1 Controller Post-Simulation Questionnaire\\nIM DURING TERMINAL METERING HITL POST EVALUATION ATC QUESTIONNAIRE Instructions: Please answer the questions by drawing a line through the option on each of the\\nscales at the point which matched your experience or circling an option (e.g., yes / no). When\\nchoosing an option, keep in mind that the integration of IM into terminal metering is the area\\nof interest (not terminal metering alone). Unless otherwise indicated, consider all scenarios\\nwhen answering. If you have any questions, please ask the experimenter. C-2 Operational Integration 1. Rank the operations from most challenging to least challenging aspect of the simulation\\nenvironment. Enter terminal metering, RNP RF turn operations, and Interval Management in the\\ncells below. Each operation should appear only once. Most challenging Least challenging Comments: a. Did one operation make another more challenging? (circle one) Yes No If yes, describe: 2. Provide any comments on or concerns about terminal metering or RNP RF turns\\n(independent of IM) below. (The remainder of the questionnaire is related to IM\\nintegration into that terminal metering environment with RNP RF turns). Terminal metering: RNP RF turns: IM Operations 3. IM is operationally desirable. (draw a line on the scale) Comments: C-3 4. IM is compatible with terminal metering operations. (draw a line on the scale) Comments: 5.
