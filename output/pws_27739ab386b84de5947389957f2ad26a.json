  "text": "the IoT-inclusive SES model. By using such a \\nmodel, one can place a technical consequence in the context needed to understand what, if any, operational \\nconsequence could result from that technical consequence. The concepts provided in previous sections can be combined into a theoretical risk evaluation framework. \\nThe steps in this framework are as follows and shown in Figure 9. 1. IoT Theoretical Model A set of\\nscenarios describing nominal use of\\nan IoT system in the SES hypergraph\\nframework. 2. Model Pruning The SES producing\\nPES and/or CES hypergraphs. 3. Risk Framework The devices\\nand/or functional units in the PES or\\nCES are annotated with their at-\\ntendant set of technical capabilities\\nand nominal walks. The list of unde-\\nsired behaviors are applied to the ca-\\npabilities in these generated walks,\\nleading to a set of potential technical\\nconsequences. 4. Impacts By examining the gener-\\nated technical consequences within\\nthe context of the walks in which they\\nappear, one can derive a set of opera-\\ntional consequences associated with\\nthese walks to be used directly as part\\nof a risk assessment. Figure 9. Combined Risk Evaluation Framework Mittal, Cane, Schmidt, Tufarolo and Harris 8 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK IoT modeling is a complex endeavor in itself as the model requires description across multiple perspectives. \\nThis paper presented an IoT theoretical model in the form of a SES hypergraph model. This model includes \\nboth IoT elements as well as the environment surrounding these elements. It presented a device-centric \\nworld-view necessary to understand the expanded impact a device has on the larger technology-oriented \\necosystem in different operational contexts. Having a hypergraph-based methodology is a suitable means \\nto understand the dependencies and interdependencies between the model elements. Hypergraphs, in their \\noriginal flavor, cannot be used for automated analysis due to the inherent computational and mathematical \\ncomplexity. They have to be supported by various axioms that allow analysis on hypergraphs in a tractable \\nmanner. The SES ontological framework provides the needed structured framework to construct \\nhypergraphs in an iterative manner both visually and structurally. The pruning process facilitates the \\nspecialization of a generalized hypergraph to a component-based architecture within the SES framework. \\nWe discussed the IT and the OT aspects of IoT through the fourteen aspects of the conceptual IoT-Inclusive \\nsystem. The proposed model provides a start towards a common set of terms describing the essential \\nelements of the IoT and its environment, creating a better understanding of the overall picture. A significant \\namount of work needs to be done before the theoretical framework described in this paper could be \\npractically employed as part of an actual risk assessment. Future research could expand upon this work to develop a detailed risk calculation methodology, automated \\npruning algorithms, and eventually automated risk assessment and mitigation strategies adaptable to \\nvariations in IoT implementation from both static (design) and dynamic (implementation) perspectives. It \\nshould be cautioned, however, that the path from the general model to automated risk assessment and \\nmitigation strategies is not short. Benefits of this future research include a way to enable improved stability \\nand resilience for IoT enterprises, and an understanding of potential paths to improved situational awareness \\nthat can leverage industrial and commercial applications. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Section 305 of PL 107-296, as codified in 6 U.S.C. 185), herein \\nreferred to as the Act, authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), acting \\nthrough the Under Secretary for Science and Technology, to establish one or more federally funded \\nresearch and development centers (FFRDCs) to provide independent analysis of homeland security \\nissues. MITRE Corp. operates the Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute \\n(HSSEDI) as an FFRDC for DHS under contract HSHQDC-14-D-00006. The HSSEDI FFRDC provides the government with the necessary systems engineering and development \\nexpertise to conduct complex acquisition planning and development; concept exploration, \\nexperimentation and evaluation; information technology, communications and cyber security processes, \\nstandards, methodologies and protocols; systems architecture and integration; quality and performance \\nreview, best practices and performance measures and metrics; and, independent test and evaluation \\nactivities. The HSSEDI FFRDC also works with and supports other federal, state, local, tribal, public and \\nprivate sector organizations that make up the homeland security enterprise. The HSSEDI FFRDCs \\nresearch is undertaken by mutual consent with DHS and is organized as a set of discrete tasks. This \\nreport presents the results of research and analysis conducted under: \\nTask Order Number: 43161204, \\nTask Title: HSHQDC-16-J-00526:Core Research Program, Internet of Things (IoT) Modeling \\nTask Order Sponsor: Department of Homeland Security, National Protection and Programs Directorate \\nPurpose statement: The purpose of this research was to develop an IoT theoretical model, and describe how such a \\nmodel could be used to perform risk assessments in IoT-centric systems. The results presented in this report do not necessarily reflect official DHS opinion or policy. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.
