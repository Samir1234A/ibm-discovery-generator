Major Defense Acquisition Program Considerations (MDAP Programs Only): MDAP Programs will address each of the following additional considerations: Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212 17.1 (a) National industrial base considerations and foreign \\nparticipation guidance, on a case by case basis (AP Para 2.3.6.1). Address the availability of essential raw materials, special alloys, composite materials, components, tooling, and production test equipment for the sustained production of systems fully capable of meeting the performance objectives established for those systems; the uninterrupted maintenance and repair of such systems; and the sustained operation of such systems. (b) The identification of items that are available only from \\nsources outside the national technology and industrial base. (c) The availability of alternatives for obtaining such items from \\nwithin the national technology and industrial base if such items become unavailable from sources outside the national technology and industrial base; and an analysis of any military vulnerability that could result from the lack of reasonable alternatives. (d) The effects on the national technology and industrial base \\nthat result from foreign acquisition of firms in the United States. 17.2 Use of commercial systems. (AP Para 2.3.6.9). Address the acquisition of major weapon systems as commercial items. 17.3 Industrial Capability Strategy. (AP Para 2.3.6.10). Provide the programs Industrial Capability (IC) strategy that assesses the capability of the U.S. industrial base to achieve identified surge and mobilization goals. If no IC strategy has been developed, provide supporting rationale for this position. i. If, in the IC strategy, the development of a detailed IC \\nplan was determined to be applicable, include the plan by text or by reference. If the development of the IC plan was determined not to be applicable, summarize the details of the analysis forming the basis of this decision. If the program involves peacetime and wartime hardware configurations that are supported by logistics support plans, identify their impact on the IC plan. 17.4 Preservation of special Tooling. (AP Para 2.3.6.12). Include a plan for the preservation and storage of special tooling associated with the production of hardware for major defense acquisition programs through the end of the service life of the related weapons system. The plan shall include the identification of any contract clauses, facilities, and funding required for the preservation and storage of such tooling. 17.5 Other MDAP Considerations (AP Para 2.4.4): (i) Competitive prototyping. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212 (ii) Dual-sourcing. \\n(iii) Unbundling of contracts. \\n(iv) Funding of next-generation prototype systems or subsystems. (v) Use of modular, open architectures to enable \\ncompetition for upgrades. (vi) Use of build-to-print approaches to enable production \\nthrough multiple sources. (vii) Acquisition of complete technical data packages. \\n(viii) Periodic competitions for subsystem upgrades. \\n(ix) Licensing of additional suppliers. \\n(x) Periodic system or program reviews to address long- term competitive effects of program decisions.
