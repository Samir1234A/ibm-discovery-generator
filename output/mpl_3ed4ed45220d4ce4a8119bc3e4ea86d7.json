An Engineer Keeps Career Development on Her Radar How do you sustain and modernize early warning radar systems that have been in place for more than 50 years? That's the challenge that intrigues MITRE's Jenn Forsyth, an electrical engineer. Radars are a 20th century technology that provide an ongoing, valuable role in our nation's defense. \\\"That's what makes it such a cool challenge,\\\" she says. \\\"Our radar infrastructure needs to function while you make system improvements and upgrades. \\\"From a systems perspective, what you're worried about today is very different from what you worried about 40 years ago. Plus, you're trying to anticipate future needs and modernize the infrastructure in a way that will accommodate new technologies.\\\" This long-term perspective is an integral part of the partnership MITRE has with our sponsors and our mission to work in the public interest. \\\"My research focuses on technological improvements in radar and satellite communications for a range of different sponsorsnot just for the immediate future but for the next couple of decades,\\\" Forsyth says. Her work supports the National Security Engineering Center, a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) MITRE operates for the Department of Defense. On-site Provides Insight into Arctic Communications Challenges Forsyth, who came to MITRE after graduating from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), started her career helping modernize early warning radar systems. \\\"A lot of my work can be applied to different projects,\\\" she says. \\\"But much of it looks at ionospheric impacts on radar and satellite communications, especially at high latitudes.\\\" It was her research and expertise in ionospheric physics and its effects that brought her to Thule, Greenland. She and two other MITRE staff spent a week on-site with a government sponsor running test scenarios, capturing data, and analyzing the performance of the systems. \\\"There are many communication challenges associated with the increases in accessibility of the multi- domain, multi-user activity in the Arctic. It's exciting because theres a lot of new activity, but it's also challenging because of the disturbed ionosphere there.\\\" The trip provided valuable insight as to how the operators use the system and how it performs in remote locations. \\\"Being able to look at the system through the lens of an operator or the site commander is completely different from seeing it in a development lab.\\\" (MITRE staff also research Arctic effects for U.S. Northern Command, with a focus on emergency response.) Now Forsyth is applying what shes learned to a MITRE Innovation Program (MIP) for modeling ionospheric impacts on arctic communications systems. Paying It Forward A college internship first brought Forsyth to MITRE. But it's the ongoing professional development and educational benefits that made her want to come backand stay. https://www.mitre.org/centers/national-security-and-engineering-center/who-we-are\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/centers/we-operate-ffrdcs\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/centers/we-operate-ffrdcs\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/publications/project-stories/testing-satellite-communications-links-on-top-of-the-world\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/research/overview\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/careers/student-programs/co-ops-interns\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/careers/working-at-mitre/professional-development\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/careers/working-at-mitre/professional-development Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2337. Over the last few years, she's completed her master's degree at Northeastern University with a concentration in electromagnetics and plasmas. She also earned a graduate certificate in Northeastern's Gordon Engineering Leadership program. \\\"Continuing my education was a priority,\\\" she says. Forsyth also participates in several professional development and volunteer activities. They include the Society of Women Engineers, Toastmasters, Young Women in Engineering, Networking for Professional Women, STEM Council, MITREs NextUp Executive Board, and recruiting events at RPI. But she is most proud of her work expanding MITREs Job Shadowing program. \\\"I'm very pleased with how it's grown in the last few years,\\\" she says. \\\"We have a lot of passionate staff here who apply to be mentors and mentees. When I got involved in the program in 2012, we had 11 pairs in one part of the company. Now we have 55 pairs across several different parts of the corporation. It's been very rewarding to see it grow.\\\" Looking back, Forsyth appreciates all the opportunities she's had at MITRE. She's also grateful to Michelle Getherall, the engineering teacher at Woburn [Massachusetts] High School, who inspired her to pursue engineering in college and as a career. \\\"Now I see her attend MITRE's annual Young Women in Engineering Day with some of her current students. She had a real impact on my career, so it's nice to be helping and encouraging other young women interested in engineering.\\\" by Kay M.

  "text": "made if the approach is continued or expanded. This report and the prototypes that were created position a team of software developers to build this type of functionality in the current web server environment, in a relatively fast manner (estimated as just a few months). If successful, the pilot program could be expanded on a service-wide or even DoD wide basis. Once the data base is established, data based records for new programs would replace current methods of routing documents for approval. It would also be possible to request programs to convert their current documents to the new system and enter the relevant data, which could be done in a phased manner over 12 to 18 months. This would allow earlier use of data analytics and correlation based statistical analysis. In summary, an electronic data-based version of current defense procurement planning documents should not be just a direct translation of the current reports, since that misses an opportunity to collect certain new data that is critical to creating more valuable management tools. The transition also provides the option or ability to streamline the current documentation, eliminating less useful components like organization charts or graphical schedules that were hard to read, and collects data sets that will allow better planning and comparative oversight using data analytics.

Public Release Case Number 18-2212 Appendix A Summary, Rapid Technology Insertion Process \\nThe Navy continues to require methods to rapidly adopt and procure mature technology in order to counter evolving and complex threats and implement its adopt/buy/develop strategy to provide new functionality to naval ship combat systems. An Acquisition Plan (AP) has been developed that adopts and improves the Rapid Technology Insertion (RTI) method developed by PEO LCS for use by the Naval Warfare Center enterprise. The RTI process provides for the acquisition of product adaptation and project transition engineering in a broad range of topical areas related to the development of new or upgraded naval warfare capabilities. The RTI method involves the steps as shown in Figure 2-1, which includes the following activities. a) Identification of a problem or need, with a validated technical definition and context. b) Completion of a short RTI Appendix to authorize the procurement action. c) Completion of technical documentation or problem statements and associated GFI. d) A draft RFP is posted, with a request for White Paper responses. e) White papers are evaluated and feedback is provided. f) The Final RFP is posted, and proposals are received and evaluated. g) One or more contracts are awarded, with a firm fixed-price Transition Study as the basic \\naward. h) Integration and ship design agent expertise is leveraged to evaluate the project and \\nestimate associated resources to complete an integrated solution. i) If multiple awards were made, a down-select to one contract is made, if desired. j) Associated integrator or shipyard agent tasks are created and funded. k) A contract option for the engineering and assessment phase is awarded, and the \\ncontractor works with the integrator to develop the technology solution and deliver a test article. l) Government testing is conducted to formally assess the technology or solution. m) If the testing was successful, additional (up to 3 years of) contract options are exercised \\nto produce and deliver units. n) Field support is enabled, and preparations are made for follow-on production contracts if \\nnecessary. These actions were designed to account for several typical problems and allow most programs to rapidly leverage them and achieve a standard program structure. The process also allows program teams the flexibility to customize the RFP as much as it needs to, although the amount of time needed to review, edit, approve, and process documents will also increase as the level of customization increases. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212 Figure 12-1. RTI Process Overview, its standard structure and its phased structure. \\nUsing the pre-approved standard document approach, the RTI appendix to authorize a project was reduce to just a 3 page appendix, which was routed and approved in just 2 weeks. A sample schedule comparison is shown in Figure 3-1, where the timeline from a trade study, writing an AP and an RFP, and contract award typically take about 3 years. The RTI approach, which folds the trade study into the procurement process and uses standard documents, should take less than 15 months. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.
