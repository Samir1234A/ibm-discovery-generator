Public Release Case Number 18-3228 From The Game of Drones to Generation AI Nexus \\nDr. Michael Balazs While finishing graduate school, Michael Balazs lived on the French/Swiss border for a year, working on \\nthe Large Hadron Collider, the worlds largest and most powerful particle accelerator. For most people, \\nthat would have been the highlight of their career. But Michael Balazs is not most people. Balazs has had quite a few high points while working at MITREincluding having one of his projects \\nfeatured on an episode of National Geographics Breakthrough series, The Game of Drones. (Balazs \\nappears at 1:24 minutes in this clip.) Along with other content about drones, the episode followed Balazs \\nand his team as they ran MITREs Countering Unauthorized UAS Challenge. Balazs and his team conceived of the idea for the challenge during a conversation. They were just back \\nfrom an early phase of teaching Special Forces troops to build their own small quadcopters. Each \\nNibbler drone was produced by a 3-D printer and carried a smartphone to serve as \\ncomputer/camera/GPS/communications. Afterwards, we were talking, and someone said, OK, were feeling pretty smart, but our adversaries are \\nsmart, too. What if they turn the same techniques upon us? In a war zone you can shoot these drones down, but it would be too dangerous to do in a city, Balazs \\nsays. And the likelihood of someone using small drones to deliver explosives is all too real. (For \\nexample, in August 2018 there was an attempted drone attack upon the president of Venezuela.) We came up with the idea of hosting a challenge to help the government determine how well existing \\ntechnology worked in capturing drones in flight. We went to the Quantico Marine Corps base in Virginia \\nfor two weeks in 104-degree temperature, no cloud cover, and 100 percent humiditynot our best \\nmove. We played the bad guys and flew four different scenarios of increasing complexity to replicate \\nwhat our adversaries are likely to do. The finalists in the challenge used a variety of techniques, from jammers to flying nets. Its clear theres still a lot of work to do, says Balazs. And because MITRE is a nonprofit with a mission \\nof making our world safer, we have continued working on this problem ourselves. I cant go into the \\nparticulars, but weve made a lot of progress toward dealing with the drone technology we see ahead in \\nthe next 5-10 years. Always trying to stay ahead of our adversaries, in 2017, Balazs and his team went to several Marine \\ninstallations, including those in Kuwait, for what they called the surge phase of the Nibbler project. \\nThe goal was to teach U.S. Marines to build and operate 72 quadcopter droneswithin 90 days. Not only \\nwas the project a success, but they beat the deadline, finishing in 60 days. Generation AI Nexus Leads the Way Balazs explains that there are three typical scenarios where MITRE helps the government and the \\nAmerican people. One, we tackle current hard problems that no one else can solve. Two, we come in \\nwhere theres an important problem, but no profit motive for any commercial company to address it. \\nAnd three, we look ahead for problems 5, 10, or even 20 years ahead, so we can figure out solutions in https://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEaRWvKfDRw\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/publications/project-stories/mitre-challenge-seeks-ideas-to-counter-unauthorized-unmanned-aircraft\\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-07/venezuela-attack-highlights-vulnerability-to-drone-assassins\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/research/mitre-challenge-uas/uas-challenge-finalists\\nhttps://www.marines.mil/News/Marines-TV/dvpsearch/Nibbler/#DVIDSVideoPlayer27131 Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-3228 advance. In addition to applying that forward-looking mentality to drone technology, Balazs is also deeply involved \\nin another major challengeAmericas workforce of the future. While helping run a hackathon about \\nidentifying possible pandemics, he and Jay Crossler, MITREs chief engineer for Learning Systems, began \\ntalking about a looming problem. According to McKinsey & Company, there will be a shortfall of up to 250,000 data scientists in the United \\nStates. in a decade. This is particularly troubling given how heavily China and other countries are \\ninvesting in artificial intelligence (AI) expertise. And even more ominously, Russian President Vladimir \\nPutin says that the nation that leads in AI will be the ruler of the world. Balazs and Crossler discussed this with MITRE senior vice president Richard Byrne, and developed a plan \\nto bring AI tools and data sets to students across the country. We believe if we give students secure \\naccess to cutting-edge AI tools and data sets theyd normally never see, they wont just become engaged \\nwith the technology. Theyll deliver real solutions. The concept is called Generation AI Nexus. Balazs is securing partnerships with government, academic \\ninstitutions, and leading technology companies. Theyre very enthusiastic, says Balazs. Everyone Ive \\ntalked with gets the value of the idea immediately and they want to be part of it. Balazs says MITRE will \\nbegin Generation AI with a series of hackathons in the fall of 2018 to engage with students right away. \\nWithin a year, I see tremendous growth. He says that in his experience, people at MITRE are driven by the mission. We do interesting work and \\nfor the right reasons. You can have a conversation, come up with an idea thatll make a difference in the \\nworldand then make it a reality. Thats the power of MITRE. by Bill Eidson Are you a good fit for MITRE, too?
