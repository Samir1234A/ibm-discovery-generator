The parametric diagram that is executed to perform the MEME Requirement analysis The analysis for every node can be executed individually or the entire architecture can be executed at once using the instance table that contains values that can be changed in the model. 2.3 Analysis Results Table 1 below shows a listing of Army nodes, their level in the node hierarchy, and the results of the analysis obtained after executing the model based on the requirements and constraints the nodes 9 Approved for Public Release Distribution Unlimited Case Number 16-4263 are expected to meet. A Fail indicates the node cannot communicate with the upper or lower level nodes given the radio equipment that they have been assigned, a PASS indicates they can. (Note: Not all nodes in the NBOI have a direct mapping to a MEME requirement, thus some nodes have N/A values.) The results of the Analysis can be exported directly from the instance table. Additionally, custom export files can be populated during execution using the Verdict constraint. Table 1. A notional export of an architecture instance table after analysis is executed 2.4 Mission Thread Analysis Description The sequence in which nodes must communicate to perform a MEDEVAC scenario was provided by the Army Sponsor SME. Using this data, an Internal Block Definition Diagram (IBD) was created (see Figure 7 below, name of blocks have been suppressed). An IBD reflects the hierarchy of the nodes defined in the BDD as nested nodes. In this diagram, the nodes that were required to communicate to complete the MEDEVAC thread were connected to define required communication lines (information exchange requirements). 10 Approved for Public Release Distribution Unlimited Case Number 16-4263 \\nFigure 7. The notional Internal Block Diagram (IBD) of the architecture, wired together to complete a MEDEVAC thread The mission thread analysis was conducted by executing State Machines to send signals between nodes defined in the architecture (see Figure 8). Nodes can send signals over the connections created in the IBD. These signals were given 2 attributes: waveform and subnet. When a block sends a signal, its radio wave and subnet values are appended to the signal. For another block to receive the signal, the receiving block must have matching wave and subnet values. If the node successfully receives the signal (i.e., there is a match), it will relay the signal to the next node in the sequence after adding its own wave and subnet to the signal. This node will then stop listening. However, if the incoming signal does not match, the receiving node will continue listening and wait for a signal that will match its own wave and subnet. \\nFigure 8. The State-Machine of a block waiting to receive and relay a message to the next block in the thread. 2.5 Mission Thread Analysis Results The mission thread can be recorded in a sequence diagram (auto generated based on the state machine execution sequence through the states) that captures the signals and the states of each node 11 Approved for Public Release Distribution Unlimited Case Number 16-4263 as it executes (see Figure 9). If a thread cannot complete based on the architecture configuration, then operationally relevant conditions are described such as the Field Surgeon never reaches the Responding to MEDEVAC state. In summary, by modeling the Army node hierarchy, relating the nodes to communications requirements, and using one illustrative mission thread (MEDEVAC), the MITRE team piloted an automated approach with a model using the requirements as constrains against which nodes must be able to communicate. Results are produced from the model execution using a variety of forms, one of which is the pass/fail table (Table 1). Other forms are more visual and show how the mission scenario comes stops after one node or another is unable to receive communication vital to successfully completing the mission because of a specific equipment configuration (e.g., sequence diagram generation halts). Based on such model execution and resulting analysis outputs, an acquisition team can explore architecture alternatives and make informed decisions on what equipment to purchase for which deployment configurations in order to ensure mission success. \\nFigure 9.

Conclusion and Future Work \\nIn FY16 we engaged an Army sponsor using an MBSE approach for evaluating radio architecture suitability utilizing as-is Army deployment architecture, mission essential requirements and one mission specific MEDEVAC thread.
