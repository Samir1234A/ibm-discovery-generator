Thomas August 2019 xii Abstract\\nThis article considers Russias potential use of operational art in space for three reasons. First, Russian Defense Minister Shoygu has called aerospace the new center of gravity for future conflicts. Second, Russias military is testing how to maneuver satellites to conduct space operations, since destroying the enemys group of satellites and depriving him of communications, navigation, and reconnaissance capabilities determines victory today in the militarys opinion. Finally, Russian analysts expect the emergence of new forms of military operations in near space to defeat orbital alignments of forces, suppress radio communication systems in space, and block orbital alignments of forces and means in specific areas of space. Executive Summary\\nWhile it is not known for certain whether Russia utilizes operational art in space, there is growing circumstantial evidence supporting that contention. First, Russia considers space as a theater of military operations (TVD), within the boundaries of which operations of a strategic force can be organized and conducted. This TVD hosts Russian satellites of various types that gather and pass information, conduct reconnaissance and communication functions, and maneuver alone or in groups, among other functions. Second, in a 2009 article in Russias Air-Space Defense, one author was identified as a teacher of the spacecraft launch and command and control forces operational art and tactics department of the Military-Space Academy. Third, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu has called aerospace operations, of which space is an important element in Russian theory, the center of gravity of future conflicts. Fourth, in a 2018 article in the journal Military Thought on modern methods of aerospace and air defense practices, the author stated such forces must (not may, must!) use the theory and practice of operational art and its methods and techniques. Finally, satellites and other equipment are capable of employing the principles of operational art, which include the conduct of deep operations, envelopment, and maneuver; and attacking weak flanks in an integrated and planned fashion, in space. These principles could be carried out in the following way:\\nDeep operations could involve Russian strikes against satellites in space or against underwater cables or the use of special operations to destroy critical infrastructure targets (SODCIT) criteria. Satellites perform maneuver operations often to inspect other satellites or to perform other missions.\\nSpace is underdeveloped at the moment, which indicates it could remain for some time as a place for maneuver.\\nMoving satellites to more favorable positions enable either strikes against adversary equipment or the achievement of a strategic position in a specific orbit, such as to conduct inspections of other satellites.\\nThe use of satellites as an operational maneuver group would be an unconventional form of using such assets and would consist of both ground and space-based weapons that can influence the TVD.\\nRussian analysts write that practically every US weapon is hooked to satellite communications, GPS navigation, and the mobile Internet. Russian EW operators claim to be able to shut these space channels down with ease. \\nSpace may now be considered a flank for planetary operations.\\nSpace assets that maneuver in the form of groups can operate in deep space to envelop an opponent. The majority of these operations are present in the planning of Russian aerospace operations today. \\nThe actual equipment employed in space or on the ground (and aimed at space objects) at the moment includes the following items that are capable of conducting maneuver and deep/planetary operations in near or deep space:\\nInspector satellites, such as the Kosmos 2521\\nKiller satellites\\nTirada-2s, to thwart communications\\nRudolf, anti-satellite strike system\\nNudol, anti-satellite and missile system\\nPeresvet combat laser\\nGround stations that can jam objects in space\\nMiG-31armed with anti-satellite missiles\\nSpace junk that comes alive\\nReconnaissance-strike complexes or information-strike systems\\nAlso, ground based hackers should be included, since they have attempted to take control of satellites, such as theoretically occurred in 1998.\\nRussian authors contend that satellites can guide weaponry to distant shores or be the focal point from which an operation unfolds. In a global conflict the destruction of the enemys group of satellites is vital to success, since it deprives him of communications, navigation, and the capability to conduct reconnaissance. The following citation indicates what distant targets might include:\\nIt is possible to use various space systems in support of each of these operations. Thus, supporting a strategic operation to destroy critically important enemy targets necessitates the use of space-based means of reconnoitering these targets; electronic intelligence assets; meteorological reconnaissance assets in the interests of a proper selection of attack weapons and their combat employment methods; and space-based navigation, communications, relay, and strike evaluation systems.[footnoteRef:1] [1: Vasiliy Y. Dolgov,and Yuriy D. Podgornykh, Space As a Theater of Military Operations: On Possible Forms and Methods of Combat Employment of Space Command Forces and Assets, Vozdushno-Kosmicheskaya Oborona Online, 10 April 2013.] Therefore, the emergence of new forms of military operations in near space can be expected that would aim to block and defeat orbital alignments of forces while suppressing radio communication systems in specific areas of space. Satellites, due to their ability to maneuver and move singularly or in swarms, could be capable of acting as an operational maneuver groups (OMG) in space. A contemporary space OMG potentially would consist of reconnaissance-strike units, satellites of various types, counter communication units, and other assets combined into a single organism. These assets are available but it is unclear if the Operational Art Department at the General Staff Academy has plans for using space assets in a space TVD.

Some are of commercial origin and some military. In the latters case, they are responsible for watching military equipment and troop movements in other nations, coordinating command and control activities, and helping weapons and forces navigate their way across the globe, among other issues. Their importance to the way nations plan to deter or conduct modern warfare is hard to overestimate. \\nRussias military is and has been deeply embedded in the study and use of such space activities, from the launch of Sputnik in 1957 to todays US reliance on Russian rockets to send astronauts to the International Space Station. In addition, Russian military thinkers are probing deeper into finding ways to use space for military advantage. This domain continues to escalate in importance. In 2015, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu conceded that aerospace is now the center of gravity (COG) of future wars,[footnoteRef:2] a reference made even earlier in 2011 by Makhmut Gareyev, a long-time prominent military theorist who is a General of the Army and President of the Academy of Military Science.[footnoteRef:3] In 2018 Shoygu added that precision-guided munitions and reconnaissance and electronic warfare systems are exerting ever greater influence on the development of operational art.[footnoteRef:4] Another 2018 article on modern methods of aerospace and air defense practices noted that these forces must (not may, must!) use the theory and practice of operational art and its methods and techniques.[footnoteRef:5] [2: Interfax (in English), 3 August 2015.] [3: M. A. Gareyev, On the Organization of the Russian Federations Aerospace Defense, Journal of the Academy of Military Science, No. 2 2011, p. 40.] [4: No author provided, Russian Federation Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu Opened Russian Federation Armed Forces Operational-Mobilization Leadership Conference, Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, 12 February 2019.] [5: A. P. Korabelnikov, Modern Methods of Aerospace and Air Defense of Facilities and Prospective Development Trends, Military Thought (in English), Volume 1 2019.] The thoughts of such Russian experts and leaders make it appear imperative for the West to study and conceptualize how operational art might be applied to the aerospace domain where many of these new capabilities or their control mechanisms are found. Questions abound as a result. Would the use of such a domain be considered separately or, more likely, in conjunction with other operations such as ground-based maneuver brigades? What would joint domain operations look like and how would they be implemented? What would be the configuration of an operational maneuver group (OMG) in space? \\nRussian authors have noted in the past that operational art, which includes the preparation and planning of missions for large-strategic formations, should not stand still or degrade[footnoteRef:6] and many authors support this contention. In 2012, for example, Gareyev noted that OMGs, a popular Soviet",
