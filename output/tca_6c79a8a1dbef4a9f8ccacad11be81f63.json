February, 2018 ICT in the States: The Problem is one of Federalism When Alexis de Tocqueville visited the young United States preparing to author \\nDemocracy in America in 1836, he tempered his celebration of the Constitutional tools of \\nthe American Federal experiment with observations about the unique relationship \\nbetween the individual states and the fledgling Federal government. De Tocqueville \\nspecifically bemoaned the absence of effective executive functions at the state level, \\ncapable of carrying out common public purposes: Certain undertakings are of \\nimportance to the whole State; but they cannot be put in execution, because there is no \\nState administration to direct them. (Chap V. Democracy in America, 1898 ed.) Over our history, even as the Federal role in regulation of business and technology has \\nadvanced some argue, exploded-in the pursuit of the public interest, convenience \\nand necessity so too have the states acquired new and diverse roles not envisioned by \\nthe framers or in their own original constitutional fabrics. The roles of Texas as national \\narbiter of public school text book content, of California as a center for innovation in \\nworkplace policy and of New York as a front line cyber security regulator all mirror \\nfunctions present to varying degrees in Federal policy structures; yet each of these, as \\nwell as dozens of other state regulatory rgimes exhibit unique, distinct \\nimplementations reflective of local economic activity and public demands for policies \\ntuned to the character of the individual jurisdiction. The advent of pervasive reliance on information and communications technologies (ICT) \\nover the past four decades, accelerated by the Internet since the availability of the World \\nWide Web in the 1990s has resulted in a state-centered level of activity which \\ncumulatively exceeds the Federal ICT infrastructure. Not only is a uniquely state- 1 Californias Breach Notification bill, S.B. 1386, 2002, became Civil Code sections 1798.29, 1798.82 and 1798.84, \\nand variants have been adopted in over 40 states. In the intervening period, nineteen Congressional subcommittee \\nhearings on Breach notification proposals have been held, with no passage in either House.\\n2 In March of 2017, the New York Superintendent of Financial Services promulgated 23 NYCRR Part 500, a regulation establishing \\ncybersecurity requirements for financial services companies. As of August 28, 2017, banks, insurance companies, and other \\nfinancial services institutions regulated by NYSDFS are required to have a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers \\nprivate data; a written policy or policies that are approved by the board or a senior officer; a Chief Information Security Officer to help \\nprotect data and systems; and controls and plans in place to help ensure the safety and soundness of New Yorks financial services \\nindustry. \\n3 NARA Catalog of EOs 2000-2017. https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/disposition.\\n4 See e.g., National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) Cyber Security legislation 2017. \\nhttp://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/cybersecurity-legislation-2017.aspx; Table of Computer \\nCrime Statutes, http://www.ncsl.org/GoogleResults.aspx?q=computer%20crime%20statutes. sponsored activity (public education) frequently the locus of individual citizen initiation of \\nexposure and training on IT devices, but the myriad institutions of state government \\nhave become the most prevalent consumer of ICT equipment, software and services. \\nAs documented by Gartner annual survey data, state-supported public and higher \\neducation, courts, law enforcement and criminal justice, corrections, taxation, benefits \\nsystems and health care are all also notoriously ICT dependent. Examples of the public policy consequences of this emerging state and local ICT center \\nof gravity abound. Among the most visible examples of state squeaky wheel policy \\nresponses are the proliferation of the California model of data breach response in the \\ndata breach statutes in over 40 states1, and the 2017 adoption of a rigorous data \\nsecurity obligation on New York-present financial service and banking institutions, \\nadministered by the NY State Department of Financial Services2. Contributing Cause: Congressional Policy Gridlock The emergence of state and other sub-federal regulation of technology activities is often \\nattributed to a lack of progress at establishing Federal consensus regulatory and \\nresponse structures through legislation. The brutal debates and episodic inertia on \\ndata breach notification is a poster child case in point, as a series of Federal response \\nschemes has failed to achieve Congressional consensus beginning in the mid-2000s, \\neven as multiple, sometimes wildly divergent approaches to data abuse proliferated in \\nthe states. While it is not the purpose of this essay to argue that point, abundant \\nevidence in simple statistical observation of the number of bills introduced in Congress \\nwith a cyber component, compared to the number of measures actually passed since \\n2000 reveals a striking disparity, with observable consequences. This absence of Congressional policy action on many cyber issues has resulted in two \\ndemonstrable responses: one, in the form of a body of Executive Orders and \\nPresidential directives addressing aspects of cyber security, crime and information \\nsharing across Administrations from Clinton to Bush II, Obama and Trump. 3 The \\nsecond is a body of state statutes addressing Cyber Crime, Data Breach notification and \\nother ICT niche topics.4 But one need not look very far back in our history to understand that, at least for issues \\nwhich couldand arguably, would benefit from being addressed through comprehensive http://www.dfs.ny.gov/legal/regulations/adoptions/dfsrf500txt.pdf\\nhttp://www.dfs.ny.gov/legal/regulations/adoptions/dfsrf500txt.pdf\\nhttps://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/disposition\\nhttp://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/cybersecurity-legislation-2017.aspx\\nhttp://www.ncsl.org/GoogleResults.aspx?q=computer%20crime%20statutes 5 Citations for Clinger Cohen, FISMA, FISMA II FITARA; OMB Circular A-130 (rev. 2016) as implementing policy for agency cyber \\nsecurity.\\n6 See DFARS Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting.\\nhttp://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfars/html/current/252204.htm# , and associated FAQs. (27 January 2017.) Federal policy in the form of Congressional legislative action, orders of the Executive \\nbranch directing agency behavior and practice are at best, limited and ultimately, may \\nbe counter-productive, especially when promptly reversed by a successor \\nAdministration. Some Federal ICT policy structures have worked well; the directives in the complex of \\nClinger-Cohen, FISMA, FISMA II and FITARA5 designed to provide cyber security \\nprotection in the acquisition and deployment of Federal agency ICT capabilities is well \\ndesigned and reasonably well adapted across DoD and national security agencies. But \\nthe uneven results in Federal civilian agency security is evidence that the scope of that \\nstructure is limited: it does not reach necessary private sector partners (notwithstanding \\nrecent efforts to back door private sector cyber responsibility through the agency of \\nControlled Unclassified Information (CUI) (formerly Sensitive but Unclassified)) rules6. \\nIt also does not deal with the risks arising from abuses of counterfeiting and product \\nimpersonation in the commercial ICT supply chain; and it does not address the $65 \\nbillion in ICT hardware and software added annually by the states and 16,000 sub \\nfederal localities to the already trillion-dollar ICT installed base in state, county, \\nmunicipal and tribal (SLTT) infrastructure. The corpus of Executive Orders and other Presidential directives which has proliferated \\nin parallel with the asserted diminishing capacity of the Congress to reach consensus \\nand pass substantive legislation is well documented. It is not, however as dramatic nor \\npervasive as champions and critics claim. For example, during the Obama \\nAdministration, the following major ICT/Cyber legislation was passed by the Congress: National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014\\nFISMA II\\nFITARA During the same eight-year period, the following Cyber-focused Executive Orders and \\nPresidential directives were issued: EO Subject Date\\nEO 13587 Improve the Security of Classified Networks 2011\\nEO 13636 Improving Critical Infrastructure Cyber Security 2013\\nEO 13691 Cybersecurity Information, promotion of private sector sharing 2015\\nEO 13694 Cyber-Related Sanctions Designations, Treasury Dept. 2015\\nEO 13702 National Strategic Computing Initiative 2015\\nEO 13718 Enhancing National Cybersecurity Commission; establishment 2016\\nEO 13757 Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities 2017\\nPPD 21 Critical Infrastructure Resilience and Security 2/12/2013\\nPresidential Memorandum Establishment of the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center\\n2/25/2015 PPD 41 United States Cyber Incident Coordination 7/26/2016 http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfars/html/current/252204.htm# \\nhttp://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfars/html/current/252204.htm# \\nhttp://www.privsecblog.com/2014/12/articles/cyber-national-security/congress-passes-the-national-cybersecurity-protection-act-codifies-national-cybersecurity-center-creates-federal-agency-data-breach-notification-law/\\nhttps://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/2013.html#13636\\nhttps://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/2016.html#13718 7 Gartner sub Federal ICT spending report: http://www.comproinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CPI_Market-\\nInsight_State-and-Local-Government-IT.pdf In fairness, the intent and appetite of the last administration to engage in top-to-bottom \\nICT/Cyber policy reinvigoration was substantial; in February of 2016, eleven months \\nbefore leaving office, the Obama Administration released a broad multi-pronged \\nCybersecurity National Action Plan, a comprehensive agenda for action which SHOULD \\nhave been an omnibus cyber policy statute, but instead became a largely unfulfilled \\ncyber shopping list incorporating, inter alia: Establishment of the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity.
