[Accessed 30 May 2019]. ] Purpose\\nCDC has a need for testing a variety of health IT applications to help support and positively impact the publics health. This paper describes CDCs vision for a National Test Collaborative (NTC)a robust and sustainable national testbed infrastructure for real-world testing of health IT applications in a clinical setting. To advance this vision, CDC engaged the CMS Alliance to Modernize Healthcare (Health FFRDC) operated by MITRE to summarize lessons learned from prior efforts; document the essential building blocks for a successful NTC; determine the barriers and facilitators to the development, implementation, sustainability, governance, and scalability of an NTC; and recommend next steps toward establishing an NTC.\\nCDC Vision and Goals for an NTC\\nCDC envisions an NTC as a dynamic network of organizations that are available and capable of supporting real-world clinical testing of a variety of health IT applications (e.g., eCQMs, CDS, EHR data extractors) to assess functionality and ensure more thorough testing before full implementation in a production environment. Participating organizations could include clinical organizations, federal agencies, public health departments, and EHR and other health IT developers. By establishing a network of organizations (with appropriate agreements in place before testing needs arise), an NTC could provide a pre-vetted mechanism to test health IT applications and avoid the costly and time-consuming processes associated with establishing one-off real-world clinical testing sites to meet a single health IT applications needs.\\nFigure 1 shows an NTCs components at a high level. There are two major roles envisioned in this approach: test originators and test executors. The idea is that test originators (e.g., federal agencies, researchers, health IT developers, etc.) would define health IT testing needs and specify the parameters for testing (e.g., test types, clinical setting options, patient cohorts). The test originator would share this information with potential test executors (e.g., EHR and other health IT developers, clinical sites, public health departments, etc.). The test executors would accept the tests they were interested in and capable of conducting, conduct the testing in their local test and production environments according to pre-specified parameters, and share the testing results with the test originator. The test executor would receive an incentive for conducting the testing. The participants and data flows in this model could vary depending on the use case. Figure 1. National Test Collaborative System Components For example, in tests of eCQMs, the test originator would be the eCQM developer and the test executor would be a selected clinical site or sites. The eCQM developer would specify the test type, clinical setting options, and cohort and would share the eCQM specification with the clinical site. The clinical site would test the eCQM locally, first in a test environment and then in a production environment, and iteratively send results back to the eCQM developer. In this case, Protected Health Information (PHI) would not leave the clinical site. This use case is depicted in Figure 2. Figure 2. National Test Collaborative: eCQM Testing Example\\nHQMF: Health Quality Measure Format\\nCQL: Clinical Quality Language\\nQDM: Quality Data Model This model could be applied for other testing needs as well, such as the extraction of clinical data from EHRs to populate clinical data registries. In this latter case, the test originator could be the CDC, which would specify information about the test, including information about patient tracking, providers, patient cohorts, selected registry, and associated information, and then would send those required elements to test participants. In this case, multiple participants would be part of test execution, including a clinical site or sites and a registry. Test data would be shared between clinical sites and the registry, and test results would be shared with CDC. This use case is depicted at a high level in Figure 3. Figure 3. National Test Collaborative: Clinical Registry Testing Example It is important to note that an NTC is envisioned to use existing infrastructure to the extent possible, as shown in Figure 1 and in the examples depicted in Figures 2 and 3. Over time, as its functionality grows, an NTC could support the testing needs of both the public and private sectors and either have a self-sustaining infrastructure or exist as a public-private partnership.\\nMethodology\\nFive sources of information were used to develop this paper. First, the CDC developed and published an eight-question Request for Information (RFI) in October 2018.[endnoteRef:24] A total of 17 responses were received from EHR and other health IT developers; non-profit organizations; private consulting firms; and professional associations representing many individual participants (i.e., hospitals, clinical informaticists, and clinicians). Second, the CDC and the Health FFRDC (federally funded research and development center) hosted a discussion on April 22, 2019 to gather information from key federal stakeholders, including representatives from AHRQ, CDC, CMS, the Food and Drug Administration, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and ONC. Finally, the Health FFRDC performed outreach to AHRQ to better understand the ACTION Network, conducted research to identify previous field-testing efforts that used real-world clinical data and previous efforts to establish a national testbed infrastructure, and consulted with Health FFRDC subject matter experts.

[Accessed 15 April 2019].] Essential Building Blocks for a Successful NTC\\nTo establish a successful NTC, there are at least four critical needs(1) a multi-disciplinary governance group, (2) incentives for participants, (3) privacy, security, and data sharing solutions, and (4) a sustainable business model. \\nMulti-disciplinary Governance Group\\nA representative, multi-disciplinary group of key stakeholders should set the policies and standards for an NTC and develop implementation and evaluation plans. Discussions with stakeholders and subject matter experts revealed that past efforts have failed, in part, due to insufficient early stakeholder engagement and lack of consensus among stakeholders. Forming an NTC with diverse perspectives represented from the outset will help ensure successful implementation and sustainability. This governance group should include, but is not limited to:\\nClinical providers\\nClinical and public health informaticists \\nEHR and other health IT developers \\nFederal, state, local, tribal, and territorial agencies (including public health departments)\\nPatients and patient advocacy groups\\nHealthcare and public health lawyers\\nPayors\\nProfessional associations (e.g., American Medical Association, American Hospital Association, Federation of American Hospitals, Association of State and Territorial Health Officials) \\nStandards developers\\nIncentives for Participants\\nIt will be important to demonstrate to participants the benefits of participation, including the return on investment. Past efforts in which participants engaged as volunteers or with minimal monetary compensation were unsuccessful due to the associated time requirements and opportunity costs. \\nSeveral incentive schemes have been suggested to remunerate participants in these types of efforts; these include financial remuneration for each longitudinal clinical record included in the testing and production environment (e.g., $1 USD per longitudinal record included in the test) or a CMS performance incentive (e.g., Promoting Interoperability Programs for Hospitals or Merit-based Incentive Payments, or an NTC application-certification process). \\nPrivacy and Security and Data Sharing Solutions\\nBased on stakeholder feedback, the legal and technical aspects of privacy, security, and data sharing are key to an NTCs early development, given that past attempts to establish real-world testing have encountered challenges in these areas. \\nFirst, in terms of protection of PHI, if clinical providers and EHR and other health IT developers test data within their own environments, these challenges could be minimized because the data would remain protected behind established firewalls. If PHI leaves the local EHR environment, it will be essential to develop technical mechanisms (e.g., hashing, pseudonymization, deidentification) to protect the PHI and ensure that all processes comply with appropriate privacy and security laws at the federal, state, and local levels, as well as with applicable organizational policies. \\nIt should be noted that any testing that is part of a research protocol under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) might require Institutional Review Board (IRB) review. In these cases, developing testing protocols that are pre-approved by federal agencies and participating organization IRBs could minimize the efforts needed for projects with similar testing protocols. \\nSecond, in terms of data sharing, if PHI is shared outside of the EHR environment, it would be helpful to develop universal data sharing agreements that are pre-approved by the participating organizations. Universal data sharing agreements will facilitate and expedite the exchange of information, and those being developed as part of current federal projects could serve as a template for these efforts. Additionally, the NTC governance body in collaboration with the participating covered entities could develop a standard business associate agreement (BAA) that could be signed with any health IT product developer. This BAA could allow for the sharing of PHI without patient authorization, in accordance with the HIPAA privacy rules.[endnoteRef:25] [25: HHS, Understanding some of HIPAAs Permitted Uses and Disclosures, [Online].

[Accessed 14 May 2019]. \\n] Sustainable Business Model\\nBased on discussions with stakeholders, it is likely that an NTC would initially be established with federal funds. As it matures, business models grounded in public and private sector collaboration would provide a strong path toward sustainability. \\nPossible business models include an on-demand model (i.e., fee for service) or a subscription model (i.e.,",
