  "text": "Alaska, to evaluate the performance of commercial and military communications capabilities in this demanding environment. Testing revealed several unanticipated problems, including coverage gaps, atmospheric anomalies, and unexplained interference. These problems all play havoc with the ability to establish reliable communication paths. The testing informed emergency planning for the first commercial cruise ship that traversed the Northern Passage in August. MITRE is investing in Arctic communications research to inform communications models and identify investment areas that may include a combination of current and future commercial, military, satellite, radio frequency, and terrestrial systems. MITRE is also integrating multi-domain expertise for satellite communications, space weather, antenna modeling, and rapid prototyping to build antenna and radio capabilities to overcome the Arctic performance challenges identified during testing. n Communications capabilities are critical to potential Arctic missions 39T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n Technology to Protect \\nEurope from Missile Threats NATO Allies in Europe are under increasing threat of missile attacks from the Middle East and others in the Eastern Hemisphere. The \\nUnited States has committed to field strategically located land-based Ballistic Missile Defense interceptors as part of the European Phased Adaptive Approach to deter or counter those threats. Called Aegis Ashore, the capability integrates a maritime engagement system with a ground- based missile defense capability. Supporting U.S. Navy and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) sponsors, MITRE provided the technical and systems engineering expertise to help field the first systemin Romaniain December 2015. MDA used a modular approach to support a relocatable capability. The Romanian deck house was assembled in New Jersey, and once a successful test firing was accomplished at a facility in Hawaii, it was disassembled, transported, and reassembled on-site in Romania. Drawing on lessons learned from the Aegis Ashore system in Romania, MITRE is a trusted contributor and is working to help MDA build and test a second system, scheduled to go live in Poland in 2018. n aegis \\n( ) noun: protection, \\nbacking, or support 40 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t 41T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n 42 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t Cutting-Edge \\nR&D\\nWith increasing needs in almost every area of the federal space, the public needs an understanding of emerging challenges and technologies. With digital engagement on the rise, and the rate of technology and data change increasing at explosive, exponential rates, we offer a global whole of planet approach to solving problems. 43T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n MITREs R&D program is designed to: MITRE Innovation Program: \\nPreparing for the Challenges \\nof the Future Today \\nIn our independent R&D program, we work in almost 100 technical fields as well as multiple domains, from air traffic control to healthcare management to cybersecurity to financial fraud. Our R&D program supports \\nand complements MITREs direct work for sponsors, focusing on near-, mid-, and far-term challenges. We strive to identify areas in which new technologies and capabilities can dramatically improve our sponsors capabilities, and part of our R&D funding is devoted to exploring technologies beyond the leading edge.

Recognizing that our innovations often need to be instantiated in supported commercial products, we enacted our technology transfer policy in 1971, well before the more recent legislation in this area. Our technology transfer program is an effective way to direct MITRE-developed technologies into the hands of commercial companies that will make them available to our sponsorsand in many cases the publicas affordable, supported products because full-scale development and commercialization are not part of MITREs mission. The program is also a catalyst for economic growth and potential job creation, so we return additional value from the receipt of federal funds. As a result, there are many avenues through which MITREs intellectual property reaches those who need and can use it to deliver outcomes. n 46 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t MITRE does do interesting research and thought work \\n168 350 261 338 Estimated New Jobs Per Year Commercialization 5 15\\n10 10 10 7 23 60 27\\n32 400 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 FY 12 FY 13 FY 14 FY 15 FY 16 CY07 CY08 CY09 CY10 CY11 CY12 CY13 CY14 CY15 CY16 183\\n168 350 261 338 Estimated New Jobs Per Year Commercialization 5 15\\n10 10 10 7 23 60 27\\n32 47T h e M I T R E C o r p o r a t i o n The MITRE \\nChallenge Projected value of the drone industry by 2020: $127 \\nbillion MITREs Countering Unauthorized UAS Challenge attracted a variety of innovators from around the world. The use of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) within the United States \\nand across the globe is growing quickly. Government, industry, and hobbyists are finding many ways to use these small aircraft. However, we are also seeing unauthorized usesresulting in drones that potentially threaten the safety of aircraft in the national airspace and create security concerns by operating near sensitive locations. The potential for nefarious use of this technology has become a major safety and security concern for multiple federal agencies. The MITRE Challenge team put out a call for solutions to detect and safely interdict small UAS (weighing less than 5 lbs.) that pose a potential safety or security threat in urban areas. We asked for innovative solutions that were affordable, technologically scalable, and workable in domestic environments. Forty-two contestants from eight countries submitted white papers outlining their approach, and the Challenge Team and a panel of domain and technical experts from MITRE and U.S. federal agencies selected eight finalists to compete in a live flight event in August at the Marine Corps Base Quantico Urban Training Center. A MITRE red team flew the same four scenarios against each team; the scenarios featured different drones and techniques that represented realistic attack schemes. We achieved our goal to help the government and MITRE better understand the state of technologies that could be deployed across the United States and in foreign urban environments, and we will continue to work with sponsors to find and adapt the best solutions. n 48 M I T R E 2 0 1 6 A n n u a l R e p o r t MITREs Unique \\nIdentification of IoT Devices \\nChallenge \\nattracted participants from 33 countries \\naround the world Gartner forecasts there will be 21 billion connected things worldwide by 2020 Internet of Things (IoT) devicesfrom garage door openers to medical monitors to factory alertsare becoming more and \\nmore ubiquitous. Unfortunately, so are warnings of the devices cyber vulnerabilities and actual attacks. The IoTs innumerable interconnections of devices, or things, will lead to new efficiencies and capabilities, but the ability to manage the IoT to ensure security and privacy within different operating systems and environments poses significant challenges. The MITRE Challenge put out a call for possible solutions to this potential threat so our sponsors can reap the benefits of this technological evolution, while minimizing the risks. Winners will be announced in early 2017. n 49T h e M I T R E C o r p",
