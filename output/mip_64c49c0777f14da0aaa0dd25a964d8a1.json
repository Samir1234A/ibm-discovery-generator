Empowering Patients in their Own Healthcare A Conversation with Kristina Sheridan Q: Why have you been focusing your research on empowering patients? SHERIDAN: Im a mom to four kids, two of whom have been battling chronic conditions for many years. \\nThe experience of being their caregiver inspired me to get involved in research for empowering patients. \\nSo, for the last seven years Ive been leading the research at MITRE around empowering patients to \\npartner with their providers for best care. Theres a lot of evidence that shows that patient engagement \\nis very important and that it makes a big difference to health outcomes. But theres very little research \\nthat shows how to empower those patients to engage in a beneficial way. We've been focusing upon \\ndetermining what tools patients need to empower them to engage, and how to integrate their \\ninformation through the healthcare system. Q: What challenges are we trying to address with your research to help patients and their providers? SHERIDAN: The problem is that right now we dont view patients or their caregivers as experts in the \\nhealthcare industry. Patients have important information that only they can provide. Often, its referred \\nto as the patient voice. Right now, the problem is they cannot easily capture that information in a way \\nthat they can leverage to make better decisions, or in a way that their providers can look at and use to \\nmake better decisions on the clinical side. We must recognize that patients are the only ones who can \\nreally explain whats happening to them, accurately, and how their illness is impacting them daily. Q: Why are chronic health problems particularly challenging? SHERIDAN: Managing chronic conditions is difficult. Patients have little time in the day to organize \\neverything that is happening to them. Without tools to help them, it is not reasonable to expect patients \\nto collect information, and share it in a way thats usable. We want to determine the type of tools that \\nwill support patients in the management of their care and in the collection and sharing of the \\ninformation. Q: What are the barriers to patient empowerment within a clinical setting? SHERIDAN: The overarching challenge is integrating patient data through the clinical setting in such a \\nway that it doesnt add burden to the doctors, but allows them to use it to make improved decisions. \\nThere are three key barriers that keep this from happening. The first is that patients dont have tools to \\nhelp them to collect this information in a way that they and providers can leverage. The second is that \\nthe provider electronic health record systems arent designed to integrate this specific type of patient-\\ngenerated data so that the providers can use it effectively. And the third is that measures and policies \\ndont specifically address how we can leverage this data to evaluate the quality of care thats being \\nprovided. Q: What is MITRE doing to address these barriers? SHERIDAN: We're looking at three areas within patient engagement. The first is determining what tools \\nApproved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 18-0671. patients need to capture patient-generated data that is useful to them and their providers. Weve \\ndeveloped the Patient Toolkit that will support patients in gathering this data. The second is were \\nexecuting clinical studies to look at how specifically these tools and this data would integrate through the \\nclinical workflow. For instance, when does the provider look at the information? How does it need to be \\nintegrated into their electronic health record systems? And third, MITREs looking at the clinical quality \\nmeasures and the types of incentives that are available to providers to encourage them to use this type \\nof data within the clinical setting. That way, we can identify the gaps and what must be put in place to \\nincentivize the use of patient-generated data. Q: You mention toolshaven't patient information tools of different kinds existed for some time? SHERIDAN: Yes, but most existing patient tools are designed around one disease state. We created the \\nPatient Toolkit to allow patients to capture their existing state of health. For example, within the tool, we \\nhave a symptom picker that allows the patient to identify a full set of symptoms across all their disease \\nstates, and track those symptoms that are specific to them. And to fully empower patients, we not only \\nhave to develop a tool, but must understand and demonstrate how that tool fits end-to-end into the \\nhealthcare ecosystem. Q: What partners are you working with? SHERIDAN: We're working with the Billings Clinic in Montana to pioneer research in how tools like the \\nPatient Toolkit can be integrated not only at home, but all the way through the hospital setting. And we \\npartnered with the University of Virginia to prove that collecting patient-generated data at home, rather \\nthan in the clinic, was as reliable as if they were sitting right in front of their provider. That study also \\nproved that as patients track their symptom data at home, that they gain an increased understanding of \\ntheir health situation. The information from that study informed the development and design of the \\nPatient Toolkit, because patients also gave us feedback in terms of how they wanted to capture that \\ninformation. We also partnered with Carnegie Mellon on a national provider survey that showed us that \\nproviders wanted longitudinal symptom severity data and medication compliance data to help inform \\ntheir clinical decisions. Q: Who will find the Patient Toolkit useful? SHERIDAN: The toolkit is particularly beneficial for patients who have multiple chronic conditions. For \\nexample, for veterans seeing multiple providers both inside and outside the VA for multiple conditions, \\nthe toolkit allows them to capture all their information across all their illnesses and ensures that each \\nprovider has the same set of information. It also helps the patients capture that information remotely. If \\nthey have a long way to travel, patients need an accurate understanding of whats happening to them \\nbefore they pick up the phone and call their providers. Q: How do you measure success in patient empowerment? SHERIDAN: Patients leave the hospital today with a piece of paper. When we truly empower patients, \\ntheyll leave with tools that will help them manage at home, capture information that they can share \\nwith their doctors, and partner for better health outcomes. Were executing a clinical study that looks at \\nthe barriers that patients face in leveraging these tools, and the impact the tools and this data have on \\nthe clinicians' workflow to ensure it doesnt add burden. And were looking at the health outcomes of \\nthe patients when this patient data is integrated in and leveraged by the providers. Were also looking at \\nApproved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 18-0671. the cost implications to the hospital. Are there incentives available to support the use of this data and \\nthese tools, and does the use of these tools reduce the costly part of hospital care? For example, do \\npatients have a reduced number of ER visits and readmissionsand increased numbers of standard \\nvisits? We also need to evaluate if this patient data can be used to measure the quality of care to \\npatients and potentially increase the level of incentives hospitals receive. _top\\n _GoBack \",",
