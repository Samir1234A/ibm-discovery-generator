  "text": "    \"text\": \" Fleet Forecasting Tool Keeps U.S. Aviation System a Step Ahead MITRE is helping the Federal Aviation Administration predict how commercial aircraft fleets will grow \\nand evolve in the future. The insights help the agency plan for the future of the National Airspace \\nSystem. To keep the National Airspace System (NAS) running smoothly, the Federal Aviation Administration \\nneeds good projections of air traffic growth and the evolving capabilities of commercial aircraft. That \\nincludes anticipating how many flights airlines might schedule in a given year, what routes they would \\nserve, how many passengers and how much cargo they would fly, and the types of aircraft they would \\nuse. That information supports the work of multiple FAA offices. For instance, some FAA analysts use fleet \\nforecasts to predict which airports might soon reach capacity and where congestion might be a problem \\nin coming years. Others monitor and predict aviation emission levels, based on the number and mix of \\naircraft traversing the nation's skies. Still others seek to understand when certain technologies aboard \\naircraft will become common so that new, more efficient flight procedureswhich depend on those \\ntechnologiescan be widely adopted in the NAS. For many years, the FAA contracted with an external vendor to provide the forecasts. But in recent years, \\nthe agency decided it needed a more flexible capability than the static reports it had been using. The FAA \\nasked MITRE to find an agile approach to exploring the agency's current and future needs, and to \\ndevelop a capability that would meet them. Web-Based Tool Introduces Flexibility That led to the creation of MITRE's fleetForecaster. It is a web-based tool that both MITRE researchers \\nand FAA analysts now use to forecast the nation's future commercial fleet inventory. \\\"There are two parts to the tool,\\\" says project leader Simon Tsao. \\\"One provides fleet forecasts for the \\nentire NAS. That gives analysts a look at the expected U.S. air carrier fleet in some future year. The \\nforecast extends out as far as 40 years.\\\" The second part of the tool provides a breakdown of that nationwide overview. \\\"It's at the airport level,\\\" \\nTsao explains. \\\"For example, an analyst can use fleetForecaster to see what the expected mix of aircraft \\ntypes would be for flights flying out of Washington Dulles International Airport in a given year.\\\" The FAA \\nhas had access to the NAS-wide aspect of the web-based tool since 2016 and the airport-specific \\ncapability since 2017. The tool provides a much more automated system for collecting and preparing the necessary datasets, \\napplying algorithms and logic to that data to create the forecasts, and using those outputs in analyses. Automating a Manual Process \\\"Prior to fleetForecaster, creating the forecast was a very manual process,\\\" Tsao says. \\\"There was a lot to \\ntrack and manage. It included information such as aircraft registration and flight data, airline press \\nreleases on their plans to order, transfer, or retire aircraft, and Securities Exchange Commission filings \\nwith data about airlines' contracts with manufacturers to receive deliveries of various aircraft. We still \\nhave to do some of that data gathering, but it's a much more manageable and automated process.\\\" MITRE then stores all the data in a back-end server. \\\"That makes it a lot easier to manage than when it \\nwas provided in different forms,\\\" he says. \\\"It's also more transparent. With the legacy forecast reports, \\nthe sources of the data weren't tracked. In fleetForecaster, analysts can easily see what the various \\ndatasets are. It's all captured on our servers.\\\" Enabling \\\"What-if\\\" Explorations Another of the tool's advantages over the manually created report is its flexibility. \\\"In the old product, \\nyou got one forecast. Analysts couldn't really see or change the inputs in the forecast,\\\" Tsao says. \\\"With \\nfleetForecaster, they can modify various parameters to see how that would affect forecast results.\\\" There are any number of \\\"what-if\\\" scenarios analysts can explore by altering the tool's forecast settings. \\nFor example, fleetForecaster assumes a 25-year lifespan for passenger aircraft and a 45-year lifespan for \\ncargo aircraft. \\\"But analysts can change those figures if they believe existing aircraft will be retired \\nsooner than what's assumed in the tool. That could mean aircraft with more sophisticated technology \\nmight enter the fleet sooner, which could affect projections of NAS capacity and efficiency.\\\" Similarly, if researchers in the FAA's Office of Environment and Energy want to see what would happen \\nto their aviation emissions projections if a higher number of aircraft with a particular engine type enter \\nthe fleet, or if a new type of aircraft were introduced, they could easily recreate a forecast scenario in \\nfleetForecaster for their analysis. fleetForecaster is also supporting information sharing among the FAA's diverse analysts and offices. \\n\\\"They all have access to a single web-based tool and a consistent dataset, so they have a shared \\nunderstanding of what all analyses are based upon,\\\" Tsao says. \\\"That helps facilitate cross-agency \\ncollaboration.\\\" by Marlis McCollum Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.
