Executive Summary \\nTo analyze complex systems, stakeholders apply ad-hoc methods to model their systems and transfer their inputs to simulation engineers. What is needed is a holistic approach that enables an agile approach to analytics. Systems are tested and validated against the technical requirements, and then they are delivered. Such an approach integrates the validation requirements as an active part, allowing engineers and operators to evaluate and ultimately validate alternative approaches in an agile environment, which are optimized, feasible, and valid by their design. This paper describes a pilot project to study the feasibility of an approach that supports architecture development trade- off analyses incorporating sponsor data with MBSE tools as a first step towards a holistic approach to analytics. This approach allows for integrated analysis of model data in the context of a common architecture. The pilot (and approach) described in this paper produced an integrated model containing architecture artifacts, operational constraints, and requirements within an MBSE tool repository that allowed validation of requirements as an integrated part of the architecture development process. The model was executed to enable evaluation over the various mission threads and related operational constraints thus allowing architecture trade-off analyses based on operational metrics. With this approach, analysis results are documented as part of the model and are reproducible. In FY16 the MITRE team engaged an Army sponsor using an MBSE approach for evaluating radio architecture suitability utilizing as-is Army deployment architecture, mission essential requirements and one mission specific MEDEVAC thread. The approach and prototype have been transitioned to an Army sponsor (ASA(ALT) SOSE&I) for use on a direct project. The pilot model described in this paper can be used as an exemplar for codifying an analysis plan in the context of an integrated architectural model which includes structural architecture and attributes, requirements, and constraints for evaluation. The natural progression within MBSE is to move functional operation threads from an architectural environment to a simulation environment for further numerical based analyses. Currently, this is accomplished using various methods, many of which are proprietary one-time methods constitute a re-occurring expense. Exploring the operational context is necessary for architectural relevance. Extending that analysis to performance evaluation in DES is also necessary and should be performed in a manner such that model data is automatically moved from an operational context architecture model to a DES model and back (to adjust the overall architecture of the system based on DES-based analysis results). In FY17, we will continue to collaborate with industry and academia to define an interchange mapping between SysMLs XMI export format and DES, with the goal of evolving this mapping to a standard specification. This MITRE research work and its product (an industry standard) will produce a modeling environment that supports the broadest range of Model-based Systems Engineering activities from requirements gathering to training, Verification and Validation, through testing, and Operations and Maintenance. Success will impact government enterprises as they respond to opportunities and threats grounded in well-formed models and validated information to conduct what-if analyses. iii Approved for Public Release Distribution Unlimited Case Number 16-4263 2.

Introduction \\nTo analyze complex systems, stakeholders apply ad-hoc methods to model their systems and transfer their inputs to simulation engineers. What is needed is a holistic approach that enables an agile approach to analytics. This paper describes a pilot project to study the feasibility of an approach that supports architecture development trade-off analyses incorporating sponsor data with MBSE tools as a first step towards a holistic approach to analytics. Such an approach allows for integrated analysis of model data in the context of a common architecture. The pilot (and approach) described in this paper produced an integrated model containing architecture artifacts, operational constraints, and requirements within an MBSE tool repository that allowed validation of requirements as an integrated part of the architecture development process. The model was executed to enable evaluation over the various mission threads and related operational constraints thus allowing architecture trade-off analyses based on operational metrics. With this approach, analysis results are documented as part of the model and are reproducible. The approach described in this paper and applied during the pilot project will enable a government Enterprise to respond to opportunities and threats based on an agile, repeatable process and analysis capability. 2. Pilot Project 1.1 Problem Description An Army sponsor oversees equipment acquisition, development and deployment (e.g., fielding). Their need is to optimize the acquisition decisions by procuring and distributing the equipment to support mission needs under the constraints of budgets and procurement timelines. This presents the sponsor with a multi-dimensional optimization challenge, where the decision parameters are highly interrelated and the stakeholder needs must be met to ensure successful mission outcomes. Currently, the Army sponsor process involves gathering all needed data in a spreadsheet and performing day-long permutation analysis, using heuristic techniques and trial and error methods to achieve a procurement decision. This approach has provided sub-optimal results since, under the best intentions, it has led to deployment of equipment to echelons where the equipment may be operationally or technically interoperable. The sponsors approach is to review and adjust mission command required capabilities and solutions to deliver good enough and affordable Army network capabilities that are synchronized and fielded to better enable our formations and Soldiers to fight. 1.2 Stakeholder Needs and Current Army Approach The Army sponsor needs to identify voice and data communications requirements by platform, allocated waveforms, and provide radio hardware in order to build a Network Design by formation type. With the current approach, the Army has focused their effort on Table of Organization and Equipment (TOE) deployable units ~ i.e., projected combat power. A spreadsheet is used to list all identified elements. The goal is to identify required capabilities by echelon for dismounted leaders and soldiers, platforms and command posts, and to recommend Mission Essential and Mission 2 Approved for Public Release Distribution Unlimited Case Number 16-4263 Enhancing capabilities (MEME)1. The aim is to optimize Benefit versus Cost over time while meeting the yearly budget and fielding a common baseline(s) to more units. Currently, the sponsor uses the data in the spreadsheet to analyze what capability is delivered for alternative Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) procurements and fielding options. The process is manual, labor intensive, and prone to errors of omission. The Army sponsor would like to be able to compare an IBCT architecture quantitatively while leveraging Main Communications Node (MCN) performance analysis metrics and Army Traffic Model (ATM) data. 3. Research Approach and Pilot Model \\nThis MITRE Innovation Program (MIP) sponsored research identified an MBSE approach, conducted a pilot project and proposed a solution to an Army sponsor that can be organized into four (4) phases: 1. Conduct mission thread analysis to identify the contexts and constraints most important to \\nthe user. 2. Conduct structural analysis based on the system architecture (e.g., can all required \\ncapabilities be provided in the form of system functionality, i.e., by mapping of the operational view of the mission thread and system view of the proposed solution?) 3. Conduct dynamic analysis based on the execution of the structural architecture and mission \\nthread model. 4. Present the results of the analysis to a decision maker using formats that support interactive \\ndata visualization methods. To enable the sponsor to make informed equipment acquisition decisions, the approach includes representing requirements, the constraints used to dynamically evaluate the requirements and the architecture structure that is used as the context for performing various types of analyses. We identified three (3) types of analysis impactful in the sponsor context and prototyped the first 2 types: Architecture analysis Evaluated architecture deployment suitability of a structural as-is \\narchitecture. Requirements and evaluation constraints for measuring node suitability were defined in the model. Each node in the architecture node graph was then evaluated based on node attributes as well as node placement",
