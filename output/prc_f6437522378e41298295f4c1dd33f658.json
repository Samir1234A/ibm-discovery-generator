Inject Training and Experience to Support a Flexible Agile Approach: Agile coaches, with deep experience in managing agile programs, provide the needed expertise to guide program teams. Observations/Challenges: It is an understatement to say that, applying an Agile approach to software development is not easy. The need for an experienced, co-located Agile coach in a clearly defined visible role is made more and more apparent every day. Programs frequently encounter difficult or unique situations that require training, experience, and guidance. Recommendation: The Defense Acquisition University (DAU) offers some short courses that provide acquisition and source selection teams with tools to help understand the different methodologies of Agile software development. One important continuous learning course, Continuous learning module CLE076 Introduction to Agile Software Development for Defense, includes Agile approaches, and benefits and risks of Agile development. DAU also offers a series of short videos produced by DAUs Agile subject matter experts (SMEs), Mr. Chris Collins and Mr. Robert Thomas. Additional videos on the site include Agile Software Development and Scrum 101. These videos cover basic principles of Agile software development. By investing time in these course offerings and understanding principles of Agile development, an organization will be better positioned to write requirements or define higher level objectives for a SOO with flexible and open parameters. Moreover, understanding the intricacies of standing up a large Agile development program, particularly one with many levels and comprising a large solution, requires a Sherpa who has done similar work in the past. It is not sufficient to learn on the job with so much at stake. The coach can also have bigger impact with a clearly defined role on the program. https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/SpecialReport/2016_ 63.pdf\\nhttps://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/procurement/guidance/modular-approaches-for-information-technology.pdf\\nhttps://www.scaledagileframework.com/agile-contracts/\\nhttps://www.gao.gov/assets/600/593091.pdf\\nhttps://www.gao.gov/assets/600/593091.pdf\\nhttps://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/SpecialReport/2016_ 63.pdf\\nhttps://media.defense.gov/2019/Apr/30/ /-1/-1/0/SOFTWAREISNEVERDONE_REFACTORINGTHEACQUISITIONCODEFORCOMPETITIVEADVANTAGE_FINAL.SWAP.REPORT.PDF\\nhttps://media.defense.gov/2019/Apr/30/ /-1/-1/0/SOFTWAREISNEVERDONE_REFACTORINGTHEACQUISITIONCODEFORCOMPETITIVEADVANTAGE_FINAL.SWAP.REPORT.PDF 11 Agile purists are not able to deliver success or positive change. The best Agile development implementations tailor the methods to the needs of the organization. The best coaches understand the principles and know what to tailor to help the organization progress and become more efficient, while not tailoring away the goodness that is enabled by the agile methods. Additionally, program teams should reply upon a Sherpa who can guide the program and keep it on a path to success. Agile coaches, with deep experience in managing agile programs, provide the needed expertise to guide program teams; they should be integrated into the Governments program management team and empowered. Programs must adopt and include a co-located agile coach in a clearly defined, visible role. This role should not be provided by the contractor who is leading the development effort. 9. Institute a Change Management Process: Change management needs to continue throughout the lifecycle of the program, and programs should continuously look to adopt such practices at a larger scale. Observations/Challenges: In many cases, a program team establishes a clear and disciplined roadmap to achieving program success but are less disciplined when an unexpected change disrupts the teams plans. This, in turn, could result in extended delays and additional unnecessary costs. Implementing Agile Development requires change in organizations. This includes change to their planning processes, change to their deliverables, change in the way testing is accomplished, and change in how deployments are managed. It is insufficient to enable changes in one area and expect each of the other areas to change themselves. This change should be accomplished as part of the DevSecOps Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). Recommendation: The introduction of flexibility into acquisition processes does not mean that the processes should be undisciplined. Brown and Hegarty provide a sound recommendation and caution the Government to continuously Anticipate the unexpected and include language to govern contract extensions.7 This not only ensures that contractors are fully prepared to adapt to evolving needs, but also encourages them to build a plan in response to the Government request for proposal (RFP) describing how the contractor will deal with inevitable changes to avoid having to re-negotiate the contract. 7 Brown, A. a requirements backlog meets this need. Finally, the established change management process must include repeatable processes for evaluating and reprioritizing the backlog (or equivalent) on a regular basis. Establishing this normalized rhythm of reprioritization will minimize many of the negative effects that evolving requirements generate. Change management needs to continue throughout the lifecycle of the program, and programs should continuously look to adopt such practices at a larger scale. Furthermore, it is imperative that programs are aware and build relationships with supporting organizations to help make and support change throughout the programs lifecycle. 10. Enforce a Robust Requirements Elicitation and Development Process: It is imperative to time-box requirement elicitation, and most importantly, to have all of the stakeholders in the room, working collaboratively on defining these requirements. 8 RFP Patterns and Techniques for Successful Agile Contracting, Software Engineering Institute, November 2016. https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/SpecialReport/2016_ 63.pdf 9 Ibid. 10 Brown, A. however, if the Government does not want to create this definition upfront, it should require offerors to include that definition as part of their Agile proposal or the proposed process. Ultimately, this definition, tied with a well-defined vision, will be used to accept or reject the contractors output at the end of each sprint and will maintain boundaries to promote greater flexibility within. 12. Identify the Right Agile Development Metrics: Practitioners must define metrics to determine value to the end user. Observations/Challenges: Pursuant to Section 872 of the 2018 NDAA, the Defense Innovation Board (DIB) conducted a study on Software Acquisition Practices (SWAP). The first of three (3) fundamental themes discussed how Speed and cycle time are the most important metrics for managing software.13 This aligns to the 2018 National Defense Strategy to ensure that the U.S. Government executes acquisition and development faster than its adversaries. However, finding the right metrics to use for evaluating a program can be challenging and must progress beyond estimating complexity based on Source Lines of Code and in terms of programmer productivity.14 Recommendation: The DIB Metrics for Software Development report stipulates that different software types (e.g., commercial, custom, or blends) will drive different metrics to evaluate program success. Consequently, the report recommends deployment rate, response rate, code quality, and program management as four (4) necessary categories of metrics, while providing discrete examples that can be incorporated into both acquisition strategies and plans to maintain accountability for program success. Finally, practitioners must define metrics to determine value to the end user in relation to the aforementioned four (4) general categories to align programmatic and mission success. As with the Vision, and definition of Done, strong metrics help to communicate clear reasonable boundaries, allowing for greater variability of activities and flexibility within those limits. 13. Develop an Overall Vision: The Product Vision, coupled with the use of a SOO, provides flexibility. 13 Defense Innovation Board (DIB) Software Acquisition and Practices (SWAP) Report. https://innovation.defense.gov/software/ 14 Defense Innovation Board (DIB) Metrics for Software Development. https://media.defense.gov/2019/May/02/ /-1/-1/0/DEFENSEINNOVATIONBOARDMETRICSFORSOFTWAREDEVELOPMENT.PDF 15 Observations/Challenges: FAR 15.203(a)(1) requires Requests for Proposals (RFPs) to describe the Governments requirements; however, it is significantly more difficult to define tasks and develop a work statement for an Agile-like requirement due the evolving nature of solution development and employment. Recommendation: In 2014, Scrum.inc hosted a presentation on Agile Contracts: The Foundation of Successful Partnering, led by Alex Brown and Christopher Hegarty, which suggested that agencies specify overall vision and context in the Statement of Objectives (SOO) versus stipulating the required process.15 This approach enables the Government to articulate a framework and award flexible contracts that meet the Governments vision. The TechFAR also recommends the use of a Product Vision, which establishes a high-level definition of the scope of the project, specifies expected outcomes, and produces high level budgetary estimates. This Product Vision, coupled with the use of a SOO, provides flexibility and allows vendors to develop innovative solutions.16 14. When in Agile, Act Like an 874: Tailor programs to reduce contract requirements for DoD software development. Observations/Challenges: The role of these 874 pilots is to write the book on how Agile can be best integrated into the current Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition system to help streamline delivery of software intensive developments. Just because a program or project is not explicitly designated as a formal 874 project doesnt mean that agencies cannot utilize 874 Agile best practices to build a better solution.
