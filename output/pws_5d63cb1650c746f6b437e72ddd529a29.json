  "text": "of design, implementation, and evaluation of payment and care models, and they should be engaged as partners in their own care. The collaboration in design of payment and care models should include oversight, governance, and interface with the communities where care is delivered. At the point of care, patients and families should be engaged in ways that match their needs, capacities, and preferences. Collaborative care should be aligned with patient goals, values, and preferences (including language), and should reflect shared care planning and decision-making throughout the care continuum. Positive impact on patient care and health should be paramount. The central consideration in all payment design should be improving patient health outcomes, experience of care, and health equity, while also ensuring the most effective use of health care resources. Measures of performance and impact should be meaningful, actionable, and transparent to consumers, patients, and family caregivers. New payment models should be assessed using measures that are meaningful to patients and families. They should prioritize the use of measures derived from patient-generated data that address both care experience and outcomes. Measures should also address the full spectrum of care, care continuity, and overall performance of specific models. Measures should be granular enough to enable patients to make informed decisions about providers and treatments. Primary care services are foundational and must be effectively coordinated with all other aspects of care. Payment models should foster this coordination, particularly between primary and specialty care, in order to promote: optimal coordination, communication, and continuity of care; trusted relationships between clinicians and patients/families; concordance with patient goals, values, and preferences; integration of non-clinical factors and community supports; and coordination of services delivered through non-traditional settings and modalities that meet patient needs. Effective delivery and coordination of primary care services should promote better care experience, optimal patient engagement, better health outcomes, and increased health equity. Health equity and care for high-need populations must be improved. New payment models should foster health equity, including access to innovative approaches to care and preventing any discrimination in care. They should collect data that allow for assessment of differential Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2546. 46 impacts and the identification and redress of disparities in health, health outcomes, care experience, access, and affordability. Patient and family engagement and activation should be supported by technology. New payment models should promote use of information technology that enables patients and their designated caregivers to easily access their health information in a meaningful format that enables them to use the information to better manage and coordinate their care. The technology should also enable patients to contribute information and communicate with their providers, and it should foster the patient-clinician partnership in ongoing monitoring and management of health and care. Financial incentives used in all models should be transparent and promote better quality as well as lower costs. Financial incentives for providers and patients should be fully disclosed so that patients and consumers understand how new payment approaches differ from traditional fee-for-service models, and how certain incentives may impact the care providers recommend or provide. Financial incentives should be developed in partnership with patients and consumers in order to reflect how patients define value, and to reduce financial barriers to needed care and ensure that patients are not steered to lower-cost care without regard for quality. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-2546. 47 Appendix G: About the CMS Alliance to Modernize Healthcare The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) sponsors the CMS Alliance to Modernize Healthcare (CAMH), the first federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) dedicated to strengthening our nations health care system. CAMH is the convener of the LAN. The CAMH FFRDC enables CMS, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and other government entities to access unbiased research, advice, guidance, and analysis to solve complex business, policy, technology, and operational challenges in health mission areas. The FFRDC objectively analyzes long-term health system problems, addresses complex technical questions, and generates creative and cost-effective solutions in strategic areas such as quality of care, new payment models, and business transformation. Formally established under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 35.017, FFRDCs meet special, long- term research and development needs integral to the mission of the sponsoring agencywork that existing in-house or commercial contractor resources cannot fulfill as effectively. FFRDCs operate in the public interest, free from conflicts of interest, and are managed and/or administered by not-for-profit organizations, universities, or industrial firms as separate operating units. The CAMH FFRDC applies a combination of large-scale enterprise systems engineering and specialized health subject matter expertise to achieve the strategic objectives of CMS, HHS, and other government organizations charged with health-related missions. As a trusted, not-for-profit adviser, the CAMH FFRDC has access (beyond what is allowed in normal contractual relationships) to government and supplier data, including sensitive and proprietary data, and to employees and government facilities and equipment that support health missions. CMS conducted a competitive acquisition in 2012 and awarded the CAMH FFRDC contract to The MITRE Corporation (MITRE). MITRE operates the CAMH FFRDC in partnership with CMS and HHS, and maintains a collaborative alliance of partners from nonprofits, academia, and industry. This alliance provides specialized expertise, health capabilities, and innovative solutions to transform delivery of the nations health care services. Government organizations and other entities have ready access to this network of partners. This includes select qualified small and disadvantaged businesses. The FFRDC is open to all CMS and HHS Operating Divisions and Staff Divisions. In addition, government entities outside of CMS and HHS can use the FFRDC with the permission of CMS, CAMHs primary sponsor.
