  "text": "between the trail aircrafts time-\\nto-go at the ABP and the lead aircrafts time-to-go at the ABP), and the IM speeds. IM speeds\\nwere calculated to drive the trail aircraft to an along-path position where its time-to-go to the\\nABP was equal to the leads time-to-go plus the ASG (as shown by the light-blue dashed\\nchevron in Figure 3-16). IM speeds were flown to make continual progress towards the ASG,\\nwith higher error tolerances allowed when further from the ABP where the time-to-go\\nestimates were subject to larger errors. As the trail aircraft got closer to the ABP, errors in the\\npredicted times-to-go were decreased, and the IM speeds aided the flight crew in precisely\\nachieving the ASG. Figure 3-16. IM Operation in the Achieve-by Stage TTG Time-To-Go Once the ABP was reached, the aircraft went into the maintain stage and the time-history\\ncontrol law was used. A MSI was calculated during the maintain stage. The MSI was the\\ndifference between the current time and the time when the lead aircraft crossed the trail\\naircrafts along-path position. If the MSI is equal to the ASG (i.e., no spacing error), IM speeds\\nwere calculated to drive the trail aircraft to match the ground speed of the lead aircraft at a\\ntime equal to the ASG in the past. If there was a spacing error, the IM speed calculation\\nincluded the trail aircrafts past speed plus a term that is proportional to the spacing error. The\\nmaintain stage ended when reaching the PTP. The capture operation5 was used when aircraft were on, and would remain on, a common\\nroute. Operationally, the behavior can be related to the achieve stage. However, the trail 5 DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a) requires extrapolation of aircraft positions at initiation if sufficient historical track data is\\nnot available. This allows for the presentation of IM speeds until sufficient data is available and the spacing\\ninterval and IM speed can be calculated without extrapolating. This requirement was not implemented for this\\nsimulation due to a misunderstanding of the requirement. However, the authors do not believe that this gap in\\nthe requirements affected the outcomes of the HITL. 3-16 aircraft captured the ASG (without a defined ABP) more quickly and then maintained the ASG\\nuntil the PTP. The IM speeds were calculated as described for the maintain stage. For both operations, time-based ASGs were used. The IM speeds were presented in 10 kt\\nincrements when greater than 10 NM from the ABP and in 5 kt increments when less than 10\\nNM from the ABP and when in the maintain stage. The IM algorithm limited the IM speeds to\\n+/- 15% of the arrival procedure profile speed. The IM speeds were also limited by the\\nmaximum operating limit, the minimum final approach speed, and a regulatory restriction (250\\nkts below 10,000 feet). 3-17 3.1.3 ATC Workstation\\nThe ATC interface was hosted on a STARS display with added TSAS and IM functionality. The\\nfollowing sections provide details on the implementations. 3.1.3.1 STARS\\nThe terminal workstation had a representative 2K display that hosted a STARS interface that\\nwas very similar to the currently fielded STARS system. The workstation had a STARS keyboard\\nand trackball (Figure 3-17). Some keyboard entries were programmed to serve as special IM\\nfunctions (described in Section 3.1.3.3). The STARS workstation software consisted of a\\nTerminal Controller Workstation display (Figure 3-18), and contained the majority of the basic\\nSTARS functionality. A key, relevant spacing feature presented was ATPA, which is a spacing\\ntool used on the final approach course. It provided distance and alerting information relative to\\nthe lead aircraft and the associated separation standard (Figure 3-19). The overall functionality\\navailable for the simulation was found sufficient for the simulation by controller domain\\nexperts during development and concept evaluation activities. Figure 3-17. STARS Keyboard 3-18 Figure 3-18. STARS-Like Display Figure 3-19. ATPA 3-19 3.1.3.2 TSAS Interface\\nFor this simulation, TSAS and terminal metering were the foundation upon which IM was\\nimplemented. The TSAS software code that was integrated into MITREs IDEA Lab was that used\\nin the Operational Integration Assessment (OIA) event conducted in May of 2015 at the FAA\\nWilliam J. Hughes Technical Center (Witzberger, Martin, Sharma, and Robinson, 2015). The\\ninterface design was heavily based on those used in the OIA because a final design had not\\nbeen specified and the OIA implementation was that used in the last major ATD-1 TSAS HITL\\nsimulation activity. Minor modifications (e.g., sequence number and runway assignment field\\nlocations) were made based on feedback from the concept evaluation activities leading up to\\nthe HITL simulation. The TSAS features implemented included the following (shown in Figure\\n3-20) as well as a timeline (shown in Figure 3-21). For more information on these TSAS features\\nsee Section 2.1. Runway assignment Sequence number (for the assigned runway) Slot marker Slot marker speed Speed advisories or early / late indicators Aircraft IAS Timeline Figure 3-20. Prototype TSAS Features on STARS Z 6\\nAAL652\\n090 24\\n180 A26 21 220 Slot marker speed Slot marker Sequence number Runway assignment Aircraft IAS\\nSpeed advisory or\\nearly / late indicator 3-20 Figure 3-21. Prototype TSAS Timeline on STARS 3-21 The appropriate time to remove the TSAS slot markers was discussed during the development\\nof the simulation environment in the concept evaluation activities. At the time, it was expected\\nthat the TSAS slot markers would not be shown for aircraft when ATPA is active unless there are\\naircraft that are part of a RNP RF turn operation (Figure 3-22). It was stated that slot markers\\nwould, at least, remain for the aircraft performing the RNP RF turn and the two aircraft that it\\nwould go between (because the merge could be challenging for controllers without the slot\\nmarkers). However, feedback from controller and ground experts indicated keeping the slot\\nmarkers for all aircraft would be acceptable since the final design had not been specified and\\nprevious work had slot markers present on final approach for all aircraft. Figure 3-22. RNP RF Turn Traffic Geometry During the development of the simulation environment, the impact of the TSAS features on IM\\nwas considered. When using the TSAS features during terminal metering, the controller actively\\nissues speed instructions to aircraft to get them on schedule. During IM, flight crews fly speeds\\ngenerated within the flight deck to achieve the ASG issued by the controller. While the IM\\naircraft is working toward the ASG, it may not be clear to the controller how well the operation\\nis progressing or whether an aircraft will ultimately achieve the ASG or the underlying schedule.\\nThis could cause the controller to be concerned about or pay extra attention to the IM aircraft.\\nThe controller also needs to maintain awareness of which aircraft are conducting IM (and do\\nnot need speed instructions) and which aircraft are not conducting IM (that may need speed\\ninstructions). The use of the TSAS slot marker is likely to be affected by IM. Since IM is a relative spacing\\noperation, an IM trail aircraft is only adjusting its path to move into its slot marker if the lead\\naircraft is also doing so. While this relative spacing operation is also conducted by the controller\\nat times (e.g., on final approach when not all aircraft are in their slot markers), it may be\\nconfusing to the controller to have some aircraft doing it on their own via the IM speeds. IM may also lead to some confusion relative to the slot markers because it provides speeds to\\nachieve the ASG at the ABP, while TSAS provides speeds to more constraint points and may get\\nthe aircraft into the slot markers more quickly. In other words, it is expected that certain\\ngeometries will lead to conditions where the IM trail aircraft are outside of their slot markers\\nfor longer periods than aircraft being managed by controllers with TSAS features. IM working toward achieving the ASG at a single point, and TSAS managing to several constraint\\npoints, could also lead to confusion if speed advisories and early / late indications are shown. 3-22 The speed advisories could be confusing if the controller sees a speed advisory that does not\\nmatch the current IAS of an aircraft conducting IM. If the controller compares the speeds, it\\ncould appear that IM will not meet the ASG. The early / late indication could be confusing for\\nsimilar reasons. However, the equivalent of the TSAS early / late indication should probably still\\nbe provided for IM if the ground system determines the IM cannot solve the spacing error. The other TSAS information elements including: runway assignment, sequence number for the\\nassigned runway, slot marker indicated airspeed, aircraft indicated airspeed, and the timeline,\\nare likely to be used by controllers in a similar way with or without IM. However, the aircraft\\nindicated airspeed could be useful in helping the controller determine what speed the trail\\naircraft flight crew is flying for IM. 3.1.3.3 IM Interface\\nThe ATC IM interface was added to the lab implementation of STARS. The display was\\ndeveloped in consideration of past work (e.g., Benson et al. 2011; Callantine et al., 2013) as well\\nas an early draft of a preliminary design document developed within (but not released by) the\\nFAA. The TSAS features were not modified for IM operations. However, the speed advisory and\\nearly / late indicator were replaced by IM information for the trail aircraft. The TSAS speed\\nadvisories have been reported as less useful for IM operations (Thipphavong et al., 2013) and\\nremoved in other simulations (Callatine et al., 2012) as",
