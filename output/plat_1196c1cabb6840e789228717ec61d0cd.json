  "text": "the likelihood of the \\nevent occurring, the magnitude of the possible penalty equates to the consequence / impact \\nif the event does occur, and the two taken together equate to the level of risk. Voluntary tax \\ncompliance, then, becomes a form of risk mitigation. In reality, however, taxpayers as a whole do not appear to make their compliance decisions \\nsolely based on the likelihood of being examined. While the perceived probability of \\nexamination does seem to impact individual compliance decisions, changes to the overall \\nexamination rate appear to have little or no effect on voluntary compliance overall. \\nIndividual behavior is often consistent with the classical theory, but it is sporadic and does \\nnot appear at the macro or systemic level. In effect, people simply do not break the rules \\nas often as the classical economic deterrence model would predict, even where the risk of \\npunishment is relatively low. So it seems that IRS examination risk (or perhaps \\ncompliance reviews by other agencies) is not the entire motivation in framing an \\nindividuals decision whether to comply. The focus of the classical economic deterrence model is strictly on extrinsic motivation. The \\nmodel implicitly excludes as irrelevant any considerations of justice, fairness and other \\nnonpecuniary (intrinsic) motivators for complianceas well as peer behavior, guilt, \\nshame, and other psychological factors. The model appears to have little or no utility in \\ndefinitively predicting overall taxpayer compliance, but the constituent elements of the \\nmodelthe related threats of examination and fines / penaltiesdo appear to have a \\npredictive relationship with individual compliance behavior. Therefore, these types of \\nactivities should be taken into account in any analysis of taxpayer behavior and considered \\nfor inclusion in any program aimed at motivating taxpayers to comply. 3.1.2 Impacts of the Environment Extrinsic motivation can also derive from the characteristics of the \\nenvironment. For example, the ability to obtain all necessary \\ninformation, and have it presented in clear and straightforward \\nways, better motivates individuals to make good compliance decisions. However, this is not \\nalways the case with government programs. Two examples pertaining to significant \\nprograms with billions of dollars of improper payments each year follow. Accountability officials indicated that the complexity of the Earned Income Tax \\nCredit creates difficulties for IRS in educating the population that claims the credit, \\ndecreasing the motivational benefits of education. In June 2015, GAO testified24 before the House Subcommittee on Social Security, \\nCommittee on Ways and Means, that the Disability Insurance programs work \\nincentive rules are confusing. GAO officials stated that SSA staff interviewed had \\nvarying interpretations of the rules and gave beneficiaries differing instructions. \\n24 DISABILITY INSURANCE Preliminary Observations on Overpayments and Beneficiary Work Reporting (GAO-15-673T, \\nJune 16, 2015) 24 This can lead to variations in the level of compliance motivation among \\nbeneficiaries. Another environmental characteristic that impacts individuals motivation to comply with \\nrequirements is the way a program is structured. In particular, programs that have to \\nwholly or partially rely on beneficiaries self-reporting of life changes, such as a change in \\nincome level or number of dependents, for determination of compliance are at a distinct \\ndisadvantage. Agency officials stated: Many beneficiaries who must self-report life changes are not focused on self-\\nreporting, which complicates agency reliance on it. Frequently reminding \\nbeneficiaries of their self-reporting responsibilities may simply not work. It needs to be easy for individuals to self-report and interact with agencies. For \\nexample, interaction mechanisms need to be tailored to the specific groups with \\nwhich each agency interacts, and potential unintended consequences need to be \\nidentified and considered before making any changes to reporting methodologies. Self-reporting needs to be individual-focused, not agency-focused or program-\\nfocused; for example, it might be advantageous to self-report information to a \\nsingle government point-of-entry, instead of having to report the same information \\nmultiple times across programs or agencies. Another major factor with program structure is how a system such as health care \\nreimburses for items and services. Agency officials indicated this can dictate how unethical \\nand dishonest individuals will exploit the system. The specific anti-fraud measures and \\nprogram safeguards that must be integrated into programs depend on the way that system \\nand its payments are structured. 3.2 Intrinsic Motivation Intrinsic motivation is a person's natural, innate \\nmotivation. Anything that moves a person to do \\nsomething out of pure interest, such as learning to play a \\nsport or creating artwork without being compelled to do \\nso, is an intrinsic motivator. It is the most effective \\npersonal motivator, and because of that, positive long-\\nrange results are more likely from intrinsic motivators \\nthan from extrinsic ones. Finally, extrinsic and intrinsic \\nmotivation can coexist; for example, a person may be extrinsically motivated by high pay in \\nthe workplace but at the same time be more highly motivated by their true enjoyment of \\nthe work. 25 3.2.1 Social Psychology and Tax Morale Social psychology has established that along with extrinsic factors, \\nthere are multiple intrinsic (psychological) factors that can affect \\ntax compliance. Intrinsic or psychological motivators include: Perceived fairness with regard to the tax system and the \\nauthorities administering the system Acceptance of tax evasion among a relevant reference group Perceived tax evasion among friends Sense of self-esteem / self-image Perceived procedural, distributive, or retributive justice25 Building on these motivators, tax morale is a concept developed by social psychology to \\nencompass nonpecuniary motivators for tax compliance as well as factors that fall outside \\nthe standard, expected utility framework (the classical economic deterrence model). \\nSpecific factors in the tax morale concept include: Intrinsic motivation o Paying taxes or feeling guilt or shame for not doing so o Being influenced by peer behavior, including the possibility of social \\nrecognitionor sanctionsfrom peers, in which the willingness to pay taxes \\ndepends on the views or behaviors of other individuals, such as a reluctance to \\ndo something wrong in the eyes of others Reciprocal motivationwillingness to pay taxes in exchange for benefits that \\ngovernment provides even though the pecuniary payoff would be higher by not \\npaying the taxes; it should be noted that behavioral economics suggests that any \\nperceived remoteness of a compulsory payment from its benefit is critical to \\ncompliance considerations Cultural factors, such as corruption, that may affect the willingness to pay taxes Information imperfections and deviations from utility maximization; for example, \\nindividuals may misperceive the probability of being detected when they evade \\ntaxes or may exhibit a systematic bias in their decision-making process such as loss \\naversion Tax authorities often pursue policies that reflect the belief that nonpecuniary factors are \\nimportant in tax compliance decisions. For example, publicity and visibility are often used \\nin both positive and negative ways. Some tax authorities have publicly recognized \\ncompliant or high-payment taxpayers. Alternatively, more than half of U.S. states have or \\n25 Procedural justice concerns fairness of the processes by which decisions are made. Distributive justice refers to fairness \\nin the distribution of rights or resources, while retributive justice refers to fairness in the punishment of wrongs. 26 have had name and shame programs in which the names of top tax debtors are revealed \\npublicly on state websites. Related to these factors, behavioral economics offers additional intrinsic motivators that \\ncan impact an individuals tax compliance decisions. These include: Cost-benefit analysisbalancing the cost of being detected with the benefits of \\nsuccessfully evading payment A libertarian approachThis money belongs to me Alienationpeople may not feel part of a society Resentment of coercionpeople simply do not like to be forced to pay their money \\nin taxes Perception of unfairness vis--vis the obligation to pay taxes, such as the belief that \\nrich individuals do not pay enough taxes Reciprocity / social acceptability of noncompliancein some societies tax evasion is \\nnot considered an intolerable act Perception that Others are not payingwhy should I? Outcome remotenessthe inability to see the effect of noncompliance 3.2.2 Visibility and Accountability Just as with motivating agencies and those that act on their behalf, \\nvisibility and accountability can motivate claimants. In particular, \\nofficials at one agency offered the view that visibility generally \\nimpacts organizations that receive federal funding more so than \\nindividuals; in other words, reputational risk is a more significant issue for organizations. 27 Agency and accountability officials, as well as applied \\nliterature and research, offered a number of actions \\nthat organizations take to promote visibility and \\naccountability in hopes of motivating claimants to be \\naccurate and not make errors or commit fraud. Using compliance activities (such as identity \\nvalidation, penalties, loss of benefit eligibility) to \\nmotivate, balanced with help for claimants when \\nappropriate; leveraging enforcement to increase \\nlevels of claimant responsibility. Informing claimants that their information will \\nbe shared with other agencies for matching. Incorporating accountability clauses in grants to \\nensure grantees awareness of responsibilities. Raising public awareness and providing \\neducation regarding noncompliance penalties\\nensuring these penalties are well known. Naming and shamingbut an agency must \\nhave credible power for this to be of value.
