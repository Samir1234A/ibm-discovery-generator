  "text": "Set of solutions. Although the original candidates show variations in performance with respect to sector congestion, the Advisory Sets defined by the MOGA include only reroutes that exhibit the lowest (best) sector congestion. By capturing these relationships explicitly, PCA readily identifies the critical trade-offs that exist in the set of candidates returned. The remaining two metrics, route blockage and schedule disruption are inversely correlated with each other and Fig 6 Principal Components of Pareto Set Solutions highly correlated with PC2. The inverse relationship implies that Advisory Sets which perform better in schedule disruption (lower values) will be represented by solutions with low values in PC2, while solutions that perform better in route blockage (lower values) will be represented by solutions with high values in PC2. This inverse relationship identifies the second critical trade-off in the Pareto Set for this example. Fig 6 displays the Pareto Set of solutions as points in the two-dimensional space defined by PC1 and PC2. Fig 6 is annotated to include the relationship between the principal components and the original ten metrics. In Fig 6, we see four distinct groups of solutions. These groups clearly capture the correlations between the original metrics represented in PC1, but which would likely have been obscured in a higher dimension space. Comparison of Pareto Set ClusteringB. To illustrate the benefits of reducing trade-space dimensionality, we employ the clustering procedure described in Section IV. Fig 7 shows the clusters and representative solution generated when clustering the solutions based on their similarity in the two principal components. Thirty-nine (39) clusters are generated and are distinguished by color in Fig 7. Within each cluster, the representative solution is shown as a rectangle. Viewing Fig 7 we see that Fig. 8 Comparison of Representative Solutions Across Critical Trade-Space Metrics.

Examining Fig. 8, we see the general trend between the trade-offs defined by PCA, namely that distance varies inversely with flights in flow and that route blockage varies inversely with schedule disruption. However, this trend is not universal, and solutions exist that balance these objectives. Specifically, the middle panel in Fig. 8 captures solutions that have different levels of schedule disruption for the same route blockage cost. Almost all representatives in this category were generated by the PCA-defined clusters; directly clustering the 10 metrics fails to capture this critical region in the trade-space. Comparison of Representative Advisory Sets C.\\nThe gray arrows in Fig. 8 correspond to three Advisory Sets from different regions of this trade-space. These three solutions were selected to illustrate how the reroutes within these Advisory Sets characterize the associated trade-offs. Table 2 lists the color corresponding to each flights reroute. Fig. 9 shows the reroutes for Advisory Set 1, representing a solution that performs well in distance and route blockage, moderately in schedule disruption, but poorly in flights in flow. Viewing Fig. 9, we see that the reroutes move around the weather shown in Fig. 4 (corresponding to the airspace south of the Washington-area airports). As the flights in flow metric is not a priority for reroutes in this area of the trade-space, the reroutes do not generate flows. Fig. 10 shows the reroutes for Advisory Set 2, drawn from the critical trade-space identified in Fig. 8. Viewing the reroutes in Fig. 10, we see that several reroutes overlap for portions of their new route, forming the flows prioritized by solutions in this region of the trade-space. The most prominent flows are located in the NY-area region (top right of the figure), which is a particularly important area for adding structure. Fig. 11, displays the reroutes for Advisory Set 3, which prioritizes schedule disruption above all else. As Fig. 9 Reroutes in Advisory Set 1 expected, the reroutes are fairly direct; however, the high route blockage costs indicate that they do not avoid the primary constraint of the problem. DiscussionD.\\nThe results generated by the proposed approach provide the reliability sought via the success rate for generating constraint-free solutions using DSP- M [1] while also characterizing the critical trade- space available to traffic managers for consideration. The above analysis highlights the value of PCA in reducing the size of the trade-space and identifying the critical trade-offs that exist. The resulting clusters show the benefit of reducing the design space in this manner, namely that critical trade-offs are better represented than through directly clustering all metrics, where the latter approach can overlook regions of the trade-space containing diverse solutions. However, both approaches still produce too many clusters for a traffic manager to evaluate and further reduction is needed. Although this is an area of continuing research, a few promising directions have been identified. First, PCA can be directly included within the MOGA, as suggested by Reference [23]. This approach would limit the size of the Pareto Set produced by the MOGA and could significantly reduce the computation effort required; however, additional analysis is required to ensure that the solutions generated would provide diverse and viable options to traffic managers. An alternate approach is to use PCA to identify persistent correlations between the multiple metrics \\nFig. 10 Reroutes in Advisory Set 2 Fig. 11 Reroutes in Advisory Set 3 considered, potentially identifying a set of relative weightings that can be used to rank solutions. As opposed to a single static prioritization between metrics, this approach could propose multiple weightings, resulting in multiple solutions being returned. Furthermore, the selection of potential weightings could be influenced by problem-specific parameters. For example, if congestion isnt a major consideration, then weights that emphasize congestion-avoiding solutions could be replaced by weights that vary the importance of other metrics. Incorporating input from traffic managers, either in advance by selecting metrics of higher importance or post-computation by selecting to review Advisory Set reroutes based on the corresponding metrics prioritized by a given solution is likely required. It is not the aim of this approach to eliminate the need for this invaluable input, only to provide the best selection of reroutes for review. In either case, additional testing on multiple examples is required. Although this problem is representative of a convective weather situation, flights were limited to those that could be captured on a fix-pair segment network, an assumption that would need to be relaxed for more general applications. Furthermore, the computation time associated with the MOGA is relatively fast but not fast enough for real time. However, MOGA computation time is directly related to the size of the Pareto Set sought; insights gained through additional analysis can identify appropriate methods for reducing the Pareto Set and the associated computation requirements of the MOGA. ConclusionsVI.\\nThis paper describes an approach for generating a set of weather/constraint avoidance reroutes for tactical traffic flow management applications. In this approach, multiple flights are considered in a coordinated way, and several feasible sets of reroutes (Advisory Sets) are produced that offer meaningful tradeoffs among important performance metrics. This will provide traffic managers with multiple, distinct options for resolving constraints, making it more likely that an operationally acceptable solution can be found quickly. The approach leverages multi-objective optimization, principal component analysis, and spectral clustering to characterize and search huge design spaces, and to isolate the critical design trade-offs that must be considered.
