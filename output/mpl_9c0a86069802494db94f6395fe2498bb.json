Such testing should simulate the complexity of real-world clinical data, clinical workflow, and human interaction with health IT applications. [1: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/hitech-act-enforcement-interim-final-rule/index.html, Accessed 04/02/2019] To address this critical and growing need, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is proposing the development of a marketplace connecting test originators and test executors, notionally called a National Test Collaborative (NTC) for health IT. CDC envisions that test originators (e.g., federal agencies, researchers, providers, health IT developers) would define health IT testing needs, specify the parameters for testing (e.g., test types, clinical setting options, patient cohorts), and then share this information with potential test executors (e.g., electronic health record and other health IT developers, clinical providers, public health departments). Incentivized test executors would agree to conduct the testing in their local environments according to pre-specified parameters and share the results of the tests with the originator. Once this model for real-world testing is established, it could be used any time a new health IT application needs to be tested in real-world settings. \\nTo ensure success, careful thought should be given to the challenges faced in prior efforts. Broad engagement of stakeholders and a phased approach that incorporates lessons learned will be essential to success. Main body of paper (4000 words)\\nIntroduction\\nBackground\\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009 incentivized clinical providers to adopt health information technology (IT) such as electronic health records (EHRs), and it promoted the use of health IT to improve the quality of clinical care.[endnoteRef:1] These investments have led to important increases in health IT adoption and use.[endnoteRef:2] However, as the demands on EHRs grow (e.g., reporting of electronic clinical quality measures [eCQMs] by clinical providers, addition of clinical decision support [CDS] tools to EHRs, and data extraction from EHRs for public health and research), there is a critical need for real-world clinical testing of health IT applications.

Jha, HITECH Act Drove Large Gains In Hospital Electronic Health Record Adoption, Health Aff (Millwood), vol. 36, no. 8, pp. 1416-1422, Aug 1, 2017.] Indeed, the 21st Century Cures Act[endnoteRef:3] mandates acceleration in developing new health IT products to stimulate health information exchange. To that end, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) is engaged in a process with industry to develop the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA).[endnoteRef:4] This framework, which has invited numerous rounds of public comment,[endnoteRef:5] proposes to increase the exchange of health information by developing a common agreement to be used among diverse stakeholders. TEFCA has three high-level goals (1) provide a single on-ramp to nationwide connectivity, (2) enable electronic health information to securely follow the patient where needed, and (3) support nationwide scalability.4,[endnoteRef:6],[endnoteRef:7] Successful adoption and implementation of TEFCA would address some of the challenges encountered to date with trust and interoperable data exchange between health IT systems.

[Accessed 5 May 2019].] Testing health IT capabilities is an important step toward advancing interoperability. Currently, there are a variety of environments for testing some aspects of interoperability and functionality of health IT applications using synthetic data. Examples of these test environment sandboxes include the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) BlueButton Sandbox,[endnoteRef:8] AEGIS Touchstone,[endnoteRef:9] Cypress,[endnoteRef:10] the National Quality Forum (NQF) Measure Incubator,[endnoteRef:11] the SMART Platform,[endnoteRef:12] Inferno,[endnoteRef:13] and sandboxes hosted by Logica Health[endnoteRef:14] and the CDCs Public Health Informatics Research Lab.[endnoteRef:15] While synthetic data sandboxes provide an opportunity to test some aspects of functionality, they do not adequately reflect real-world clinical workflows or human interaction with health IT applications, which are often difficult to simulate.[endnoteRef:16] Several analyses have shown that even with up-front synthetic testing, real-world implementation of systems can result in unanticipated challenges to true interoperability.[endnoteRef:17], [endnoteRef:18], [endnoteRef:19] [8: CMS, Blue Button 2.0: Improving Medicare Beneficiary Access to Their Health Information, [Online].

Singh, An analysis of electronic health record-related patient safety concerns, J Am Med Inform Assoc, vol. 21, no. 6, pp. 1053-9, Nov-Dec 2014.] The need for better capabilities for testing health IT applications in EHRs using real-world clinical data, clinical team members, and clinical workflows is reflected in the 21st Century Cures Act and detailed in a rule proposed by ONC in early 2019. This rule included, among other requirements, the need for health IT products to be tested in the real world in order to maintain ONC certification.[endnoteRef:20] Such efforts to test health IT using real-world clinical data will help application errors to be detected earlier in the development process (i.e., fail early) and for usability to be more adequately incorporated into testing efforts. Increasing clinician usability should lead to faster implementation of these health IT applications into clinical environments and ultimately could reduce clinician burden and improve clinician productivity. [20: ONC, 21st Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program, [Online]. Available: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2019-03-04/pdf/2019-02224.pdf. [Accessed 15 May 2019]. ] There have been at least two attempts by CMS to develop a real-world testing environment for eCQMs, which were based upon the voluntary participation of clinical providers and EHR and other health IT developers. Unfortunately, these attempts were not fully implemented in part, due to insufficient early stakeholder engagement and lack of consensus among stakeholders; the associated time requirements and opportunity costs for participants; the challenges associated with legal and technical aspects of privacy, security, and data sharing; and lack of development of a sustainable business model early in the development and implementation phases. Another ongoing, relevant effort, although not exclusively for testing health IT applications, is the Accelerating Change and Transformation in Organization and Networks (ACTION) Network, spearheaded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).[endnoteRef:21] This network is a U.S. government-contracting mechanism (infinite delivery/infinite quantity [IDIQ]) that is successfully bringing together pre-selected organizations to bid on federal proposals to answer healthcare research questions using real-world clinical data.[endnoteRef:22] Another effort in the private sector is NODE.Health, a network that brings together clinical providers/EHR and other health IT developers with those needing to test their new digital technologies.[endnoteRef:23] While these latter two networks are not currently testing health IT, they offer a model that could be replicated for testing health IT. For example, if the next iteration of the ACTION Network (i.e., ACTION IV) included health IT testing, this mechanism could be leveraged by federal agencies to fulfill the functions of a national test collaborative.

Version 9, 7/13/17 Title: Cloud Computing Expert Advances Government Missions Justin Brunelle clearly relishes working for MITRE, helping the government accelerate its use of the technology that's changing how the world operates. It's an exciting time for someone who has made web sciences his career. After all, technologiesfrom mobile systems and cloud computing to big data analytics and the Internet of Thingschange almost daily. Brunelle's specialty is cloud computing. He recently completed his doctorate in computer science from Old Dominion University and frequently publishes papers about the government's use of the cloud and provides expertise to the public and industry. \\\"We deliver concrete recommendations that accelerate their cloud adoption,\\\" he says. \\\"This head start enables agencies to do in days what they frequently were struggling to accomplish for months.\\\" Agencies call on MITRE to help them navigate challenges unique to the governmentones that commercial companies may not face. Depending on the agency, these challenges might include specific regulations, network security policies, data privacy, and other factors that constrain them from diving right into the latest technology. Brunelle has applied his cloud computing know-how to several of our sponsors. For example, last year he advised the Department of Veterans Affairs on best practices for migrating its services from legacy environments to those in a cloud. \\\"We helped the VA understand the processes other agencies used to migrate their services to the cloud. We outlined potential pitfalls and challenges, and helped them interface with commercial cloud providers. This ensured the solutions they were procuring would be as impactful as possible for the VAs customers.\\\" Brunelle has also supported the Armys efforts to adopt emerging cloud architectures. \\\"For the military, the challenge is that traditional cloud services rely on robust network connections and communications. But in a tactical environment in the field thats not always the case.\\\" His team focused on mitigating the challenge of being disconnected but still taking advantage of the benefits of cloud services. \\\"We performed research on algorithms, processes, and architectures that would allow computation in tactical environments to be performed even when you dont have a reliable network connection.\\\" Linking Knowledge Across Domains Even if the details vary, many of MITRE's sponsors have the same underlying issues when it comes to integrating or adopting new technologies. \\\"Cybersecurity is a big priority for everyone,\\\" Brunelle says. \\\"There's definitely a lot of cross-pollination of ideas here and a wealth of MITRE knowledge to draw from.\\\" https://www.mitre.org/publications/technical-papers/july-2016-federal-cloud-computing-summit-report\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/news/in-the-news/mitre%E2%80%99s-justin-brunelle-offers-insight-into-government-cloud-computing\\nhttps://www.mitre.org/capabilities/cybersecurity/overview?category=all Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: 17-0436. That's where Brunelle's other specialtythe ability to apply knowledge from one area for the benefit of anothercomes in. He's become crucial to an ongoing public-private collaboration that's helping government adopt emerging technologies. In this role, Brunelle coordinates MITRE's work with the Advanced Technology Academic Research Center (ATARC). ATARC is a forum for industry and academia to collaborate with the federal government to solve technology challenges. MITRE staff have been involved with ATARC since a 2013 summit that addressed mobile computing. Following the summits, MITRE develops reports on such topics as big data and the Internet of Things, which are available both on our website and ATARC's. Brunelle got involved when ATARC added a cloud computing summit. The summits first cloud computing white paper identified specific challenges facing the government adoption of cloud computing technologies and cited best practices that have been adopted by government cloud practitioners. It also included recommendations for government, industry, academia, and FFRDCs to pursue to ease and advance the adoption of cloud computing within the federal government. Since that first paper, the publications have become a series. Brunelle's collaborations with ATARC participants have also expanded his knowledge well beyond cloud computing. \\\"I now work with any kind of emerging technologyInternet of Things, mobile, big data, and web science,\\\" he says. \\\"As the operator of several federally funded research and development centers, MITRE has the opportunity to influence those domains and apply lessons learned to the next emerging technology challenge. At Work or at PlayNothing but Net As a newly minted Ph.D., Brunelle also embraces the opportunities he gets to give back to the research community. He serves on the programming committees for conferences, speaks at events, and publishes in journals on topics such as web content archiving and ways to improve it with new technology, as well as advances in digital library sciences. He also was the committee co-chair for posters and demonstrations at the recent 17th ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries. \\\"We often take principles that worked in addressing an issue with cloud computing, for instance, and apply them to web science or information retrieval.\\\" Even when he's relaxing, Brunelle extends his influence in the research community. He plays basketball in an engineers' league at NASA's Langley Research Center (recently in the public eye as the setting of the hit movie Hidden Figures). It's located just a few minutes away from his Hampton office. \\\"Every day is differentand that's a good thing. It's one of the benefits of working here. It keeps my job fun and interesting.\\\" by Jeremy D.

MITRE and Cloud Computing For more than a decade, MITRE has been at the forefront of helping the government weigh the pros and cons when it comes to moving to the cloud. By working across FFRDCs, government agencies, and even within agencies and organizations, MITRE makes connections between government, industry, and academic partners that would not be readily available in normal circumstances. In addition, our robust internal research program benefits multiple sponsors by preparing to solve future challenges. Cloud computing holds the promise for using IT resources more efficiently across the government enterprise, yielding significant cost and capability advantages in the process. Compared to industry, however, government agencies face unique constraints, including risk management and network security concerns faced by organizations such as the Department of Defense. MITRE is helping them address the evolving acquisition, management, and security considerations of adopting cloud technologies.
