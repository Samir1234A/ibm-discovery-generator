  "text": "an airport \\nconfiguration, the adaptation data defined one or more routes that could be taken from the meter fix down to a runway. \\nThese segments will be referred to as TRACON routes. An aircraft in a scenario will have only one en route segment, \\nbut can have many TRACON routes associated with it. The RA cannot yet know which TRACON route will be used, \\nand therefore calculates and supplies information about each available option to the scheduler component, which \\nmakes the final determination. The simplified model of TS is a simplified average behavior, fast time model of an aircraft, which has reasonable \\nagreement with higher fidelity simulations under nominal operating conditions. The model assumes perfect lateral \\nconformance and instantaneous turns. It propagates and calculates constraint data along the route, carrying forward \\npreviously defined constraints until the route data defines new constraints. The constraints are used to generate vertical \\nand speed profiles, which are then convolved to form a set of true speeds. The model also supports wind model data American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 12 and produces average ground speeds over each segment of the route. Segment distances are used to calculate transit \\ntimes over each segment, and transit times are aggregated to form ETAs at each point along the route. While simple, \\nthe approach calculates values that are reasonably close to the results of more sophisticated models. Using a route \\nwith a varied speed and vertical profile, the ground speed can be calculated along the route in both the simplified TS \\nmodel and in a more sophisticated simulation model. This is shown for a sample route in Figure 8. The simplified TS \\nmodel overestimates the speed during the final approach but otherwise has good agreement. Future iterations of this \\ncapability will investigate a higher fidelity model for the TS component. \\nFigure 8. Comparison of TS simplified model to a more sophisticated integrative model F. Scheduling \\nOnce aircraft estimates are available from the Trajectory Modeling component, TBFM performs its core function: scheduling aircraft airport arrivals. The TBFM schedulers goal is to maximize airport landing and \\nTRACON handling capacity without compromising safety or exceeding configuration constraints. The main functions that the TBFM scheduler performs consist of sequencing, scheduling and allocating runways \\nfor arriving aircraft. As part of the scheduling process, Traffic Management Coordinators may input to the scheduler \\na series of different scheduling constraints that reflect the operational and environmental conditions of the airspace. \\nUnder these constraints, the scheduler uses the trajectory predictions data to derive individual aircraft schedules that \\nhelp ensure an orderly, efficient, and conflict-free flow of traffic into the terminal area. The resulting schedules are \\nin turn provided to controllers for implementation. Commonly used scheduling constraints are pre-stored as part of \\npre-determined configurations that can be loaded as needed, however, TMCs may also make manual \\nmodifications to those constraints. In the operational TBFM application, the Dynamic Planner (DP) function contains all the scheduling logic \\nmentioned previously [11]. Like the RA and TS models (see previous section), we have implemented a simplified \\nmodel of the TBFM scheduling function using the adaptation data model. This independent scheduling \\nimplementation takes in ETA data (as provided by the RA and TS models) and produces STA data in a fashion \\nsimilar to the actual TBFM scheduler, using as much as possible the data supplied by an actual, parsed, TBFM \\nadaptation. The simplified Scheduler utilizes many of the same scheduling constructs that the TBFM DP does. The \\nmain artifacts used by the simplified scheduler are summarized as follows: Meter Fix: A waypoint, which is at a distance from the destination airport, at which full scheduling \\n(constraint application and deconfliction) is performed by the scheduler Meter Point: A waypoint at which the scheduler, in EDC mode will perform full scheduling (constraint \\napplication and deconfliction). Gate: An arrival corridor, normally associated with the TRACON boundary, which may include one or \\nmore arrival routes or meter fixes, primarily used for arrival traffic. American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 13 Airport Configuration: Determines the airport arrival runways that are in use, flight landing rules \\n(Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) or Visual Flight Rules (VFR)), internal TRACON routing and scheduling \\nrules specific to this configuration Stream class: A group of aircraft sharing similar scheduling characteristics based on engine type (jet or \\nturbo-prop/prop) and meter fix. A stream class can also be defined by aircraft category (heavy, large, etc.). Super stream classes: A grouping of stream classes. Every stream class will be included in one super \\nstream class though several stream classes may be placed in the same super stream class. Freeze Horizon: The location at which an aircrafts STA becomes frozen. The aircraft is then transferred \\nfrom the schedulable list to the frozen list. This is also the point that the last runway allocation is made and \\nthe slot is assigned to this arrival. Scheduled Time of Arrival (STA): Refers to the desired time that an aircraft should cross a certain point \\n(runway threshold or meter fix). It considers other arrival traffic and airspace configuration. It is calculated \\nusing parameters like spacing, aircraft performance, and winds. Amount of Maximum Delay Time (AMDT): Represents the maximum amount of delay that can be \\nabsorbed within an airspace (i.e. TRACON). Excess delay is fed back upstream. Route Maximum Delay (RMD): Represents the maximum amount of delay that a specific TRACON route \\ncan absorb. In terms of the scheduling constraints that are supported by the simplified Scheduler, the core supported \\nscheduling constraints consist of the Super Stream Class Miles-In-Trail (MIT), separation constraints that are \\napplied at the meter fix, and the Wake Vortex Separation constraints that are applied at the runway or Final \\nApproach Fix. These are by far the most commonly used scheduling features of TBFM. Acceptance rates are all \\nassumed to be set to unrestricted as this feature is not commonly used operationally. The specific algorithm that the simplified Scheduler implements is depicted in Figure 9 and consists of \\ndistributing delay between the upstream Meter Fix schedule and the downstream Runway schedule. First, a \\ndeconflicted schedule at the meter fix is built by ensuring that the Center Scheduling restrictions (i.e., Super Stream \\nClass MIT Separation) is not violated. Then based on that deconflicted meter fix schedule, a runway schedule is \\nbuilt by ensuring that the TRACON Scheduling restrictions (i.e., Wake Vortex Separation) are not violated and that \\nthe lower of the AMDT or RMD values is not exceeded. The process repeats until a solution that meets all \\nconstraints is found. The algorithm is based on The Dynamic Planner: The Sequencer, Scheduler, and Runway \\nAllocator for Air Traffic Control Automation (Wong, 2000) [11] and mirrors the main scheduling mode of TBFM, \\nscheduling mode 8, which is executed every 6 seconds in the TBFM operational system.

Scenario Generation \\nTo evaluate an existing TBFM adaptation, a user first must specify a set of aircraft to occupy the adaptation airspace. That set of aircraft is referred to as a scenario. Each aircraft in the scenario is defined by an engine type, a \\nwake vortex category (as defined in the adaptation data), an en route procedure segment, an initial time, altitude, and \\nairspeed, and an aircraft identifier. For the purposes of this research, the aircraft are assumed to start at the beginning \\nof a known en route procedure segment which can be selected from one of the imported TBFM Preferred Arrival \\nRoutes (PARs) or STARs defined in the adaptation. The scenario follows the single airport, single TRACON concept, in that all aircraft in a scenario are assumed to \\nbe arriving at the same airport, and only those PARs and STARs that are listed for that airport are eligible for the \\nscenario. The scenario is not, however, tied to a particular airport configuration, as the configuration changes the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 15 interior TRACON routes that are utilized. When constructing a scenario, the user can filter the full set of PARs and \\nSTARs down to a more manageable set by hiding unwanted routes in the integrated design capability. There are several options that the prototype offers for building a scenario. Scenarios can be imported in a \\nsimplified comma separated variable (CSV) format, where each row in the import file describes a single aircraft in \\nthe scenario and provides the name of a route that is available in the adaptation. A scenario can also be exported in \\nthe same format. This can be used to generate a base scenario which can then be modified, manually or in other \\ntools, before being reimported. Aircraft can also be added and deleted in the user interface manually, one at a time. \\nAircraft in a scenario can also be edited manually in the table user interface for the scenario. As an alternative, scenario aircraft can also be generated from track data in the integrated design capability. \\nAircraft trajectories, whether from recorded radar data or simulations, are projected against the set of selected PARs \\nand",
