Public Release Case Number 18-2212 Table E-3 LCSP Component Breakdown Data Elements and Types Table E-4 LCSP Analysis Method Data Elements and Types E.1 LCSP Content Not Included in the Data Record. Within the LCSP there were also several sections and content items of the LCSP that did not transform to an E-version in the same way. Notable exceptions to the simple transfer were: a) Section 2.2 calls for a table of achieved performance data that related to logistics. Instead \\nof creating a duplicate set of data, a value achieved and test event columns were added to the earlier LCSP section on key variables. b) Section 3, 2nd paragraph, calls to \\\" List all supplemental support elements that will be \\npresent in the O&S Phase (e.g., training simul tors, system integration labs, server farms, mock-ups) and whether they are a PSMs responsibility for support or supported via other means (e.g., memorandum of agreement). This material is duplicative with other data collected and identified in the LCSP. c) Section 3 calls to Briefly discuss specific programmatic interdependencies with other \\nprograms. This should be replaced by another column in the component breakdown LCSP Component Breakdown Data Element Data Type LCSP Component Breakdown Data Element Data Type 301 Title Text 330p PHS Distribution Unlimited. Public Release Case Number 18-2212 table, that identifies the interdependent programs associated with each subsystem, and whether it is dependent on or being depended on. [[Added data needed]]. d) The data table 3-1 of Section 3 has codes to indicate how the organic-level or \\nintermediate-level support is being provided, primarily F for full organic, L for limited, or C for contractor support. This table could be modified in a data base to include the dates when the status will be achieved, either as events (e.g. IOC, FRP), or in terms of months before or after the final material support date (e.g. -3, 0, 0, 2, 4, 2). The need for three levels within the O, I, and D level also is a bit lower level than a plan, and should be controlled at a lower data base level. e) Table 3-3 in Section 3.1.2 requires another separate table that shows planned competition \\nfor support, including small business considerations. This data was incorporated into the 330 series data as another column, 3312a and 3312b, for each component subsystem, instead of being shown in a separate table as depicted. f) Section 3.1.3 requires a description of all systems used to track Government property for \\nthe program. This was not included, as the data is already captured and managed by individual property management agents, e.g. DCMAO for contractors under their control and individual Government agents such as DLA or NSPCC, Philadelphia. Duplication of this data is not needed in this type plan. g) Section 3.1.4 requests for appropriate data from the cybersecurity Program Protection \\nPlan. Duplication of this data is not needed in the LCSP data base, as the Cybersecurity Strategy document data is already captured in a separate part of the data base records. h) Table 3-6 of Section 3.3.2 requires a table of data that shows what products are supported \\nvia Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with Organic Support activities. The table calls for the organization name, subsystem, activity, documentation, and metrics. Instead of a new table, several data columns were added to the 330 series component breakdown table, to provide the performance metrics, Government or Contractor status, and organization name. This prevents duplication and allows better analysis of data trends. i) Section 4 requires a discussion of program issues and corrective actions that were taken \\nto resolve them. This is not included as LCSP content as it converts a planning document into a long-term active data-base of issues. This type of content should be incorporated into a larger program issues tracking system that includes technical problems, T&E event issues, COM ECPs, and budget cuts or bumps as well as logistics program issues. [[Separate Data Base Content needed]]. j) Section 5 requires a discussion and table of key design and sustainment requirements \\nrelating to sustainment. This section is not needed as a separate data set as long as key logistics and sustainment issues are captured in the 220 series of key performance parameters in other portions of the data base. Treating the sustainment requirements here, instead of being integral to the technical requirements, allows them to be treated as secondary requirements. k) Section 6 is the Integrated Program Schedule. This is not needed as an LCSP section or \\ndata series since it is also already captured in other data sections (e.g. AP, TEMP). The overall schedule section of the data base should include specific logistics sustainment dates such as MSD or training readiness dates. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.
