  "text": "    \"text\": \" Copyright On a Quest to Field Better Cyber Awareness Tools for \\nWarfighters Today, it's as likely warfighters will be fighting attacks within their networks as in the physical world. That's why an Army center partnered with MITRE on a cybersecurity tool that puts key data into a usable context, to consider for the field. Cyberattacks by adversaries could cripple the networks and systems our nation's warfighters rely on to protect themselves and to project power on the battlefield. As part of a range of approaches to counter such threats, the U.S. Army Cyber Center of Excellence hosts a yearly major exercise called Cyber Quest. For several weeks, the military and allies test emerging cyberspace and electronic warfare technologies in the field. During Cyber Quest 2018, the Army Cyber Center of Excellence invited MITRE employees to help Army cyber protection teams field test CMITCyber Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) Situational Awareness Tactical Analytics Framework (C-STAF) Mission Impact Tooland with good reason. CMIT is built on and extends the capabilities of MITRE's CyGraph cyber data collection, analysis, and decision-support tool. \\\"Cyber Quest is like the Army's short list of what they think are good candidates for fielding in the near term,\\\" says Steve Noel, a MITRE cybersecurity engineer. A Cyber Tool with a Critical Difference: Context CMIT is a software tool for improving network security posture, maintaining situational understanding in https://www.mitre.org/research/technology-transfer/technology-licensing/cygraph Copyright the face of cyberattacks, and focusing on protecting mission-critical assets. What's different about CMIT compared to other software tools? For one thing, there are tools that provide some cyber data and others that enable the operator to see vulnerabilities in network diagrams and systems. \\\"With CMIT, the big thing is the ability to view information in context,\\\" says Steve Purdy, a MITRE software systems engineer and former Army Signal Corps officer. He and Noel and demonstrated CMIT together at Cyber Quest 2018. \\\"Not many technologies bring all of that information together in a way that lets you make decisions,\\\" Purdy adds. \\\"CMIT operationalizes cyber data, which is a key sponsor need.\\\" CMIT combines isolated data and events to provide Army cyber protection teams with an overall picture for situational awareness and decision support. It offers an analysis dashboard that allows operators to formulate and submit queries and visualize the results. CMIT's predecessor, CyGraph, was created under MITRE's independent research and development program. Discussions between MITRE and the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) Center led to Army personnel identifying CyGraph as a candidate technology they could build on to map dependencies among information technology assets. CMIT was born. Based at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland, C5ISR Center is the Army's information technologies and integrated systems center. We support C5ISR Center by developing and delivering tools such as CMIT. MITRE and C5ISR Center furthered the CMIT concept through experimentation with warfighters.
