  "text": "system were often its lack of corroborating reports [47]. In the last several years, there have been mixed indications regarding the establishment of a positive safety culture in the railroad industry. News media cited court cases of freight railroads unreasonably firing workers for raising safety concerns [48] [49] or simply reporting on-the-job injuries [50]. One Class I railroad was accused of firing whistle-blowers and pressuring workers to ignore critical safety checks [51]. There were examples of a highly positive safety culture throughout the industry, with many found in passenger railroads possibly as a consequence of market demands for safe transportation [52] [15]. As recently as this year, FRA identified deficiencies in the safety culture at the company level, the industry level, and the level of regulatory agency oversight. FRA is actively seeking to understand the problems, gaps in the industry and regulatory oversight, and the barriers to implementation of safety culture initiatives [53]. The railroads also recognize that broad changes are in order and have invested heavily in improving safety culture. Ongoing FRA-sponsored safety culture demonstrations [54] enable lessons learned to develop a better industry-wide reporting system, which requires high-quality data inputs and collaboration from the industry as a whole. The use of a neutral third party for dedicated analytics would support industry and regulator collaboration. Visualization of national trends is possible with an industry-wide data reporting system. This better focuses safety efforts and regulatory development where needed. Knowing the issues will allow for a targeted response, resulting in less over-regulation across the industry and focused mitigation options for the railroads. 6-3 Examples of successful U.S. public-private collaborations between the FRA and the rail industry currently exist. The AARs Transportation Technology Center, Inc. operates an industry research testing facility under contract with the FRA. Similarly, the ASLRRA developed the Short Line Safety Institute, a non-profit supported by FRA and Congressional funding, to enhance and improve safety in all respects on short line and regional railroads across North America. [36] At the request of the FRA, a voluntary educational partnership, entitled the Switching Operations Fatality Analysis (SOFA) working group, was formed in 1998 between AAR, ASLRRA, and labor unions with the explicit goal of eliminating all switching fatalities. Their focus was similar in nature to that of early CAST efforts: to review select fatal accident cases to determine common mitigation strategies. The intention of the group was that findings and recommendations were to be used voluntarily, not in formal rulemaking processes. While SOFA has been successful as a collaborative partnership, a 2011 report found room for improvement: ideally, reductions in switching operation fatalities would be directly attributable to SOFA interventions [55]. In the last few years, both the government and industry have been demonstrating proactive safety. The FRA endorses the advancement of proactive approaches for early identification and reduction of risk, and this year it has taken action to mandate safety PTC for certain rail operations, as well as System Safety Programs for U.S. commuter and intercity passenger railroads. The FRA also issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in 2015 regarding the mandate of Risk Reduction Programs for U.S. freight railroads. AAR cites on their website that with record levels of private spending on capital improvements and maintenance over the last five years and more than $600 billion spent since 1980, Americas privately owned freight railroads are at the forefront of advancing safety. Despite this progress, some laws and regulations unique to railroading pose challenges to a successful transition to a safety culture in rail transportation. For example, the Federal Employers Liability Act of 1908 (FELA) was long ago adopted to protect injured railroad workers but requires claimants to prove negligence by the railroad; otherwise, workers are responsible for their injuries [56] [57]. By pitting worker versus railroad, a dynamic builds that may oppose a positive safety climate. Attention is needed to changing the business environment and other barriers impacting a successful collaborative environment. Fortunately, as demonstrated throughout the history of aviation, laws can be changed. Another challenge falls in the area of secure and effective handling of event reporting and collected data. Methods and analytics that accurately involve the what, where and when of events are critical but protecting the who is of utmost importance. In cases where there are mishandling of reporting, the delicate trust relationships, central to success, could easily break down. A regulator or manager seeks to penalize employee errors, secured data becomes compromised, or analyses lack sufficient quality. Learning from experiences and leading practices across both domains will be key to the successful collaborative partnership for rail safety. As with any positive, successful relationship, it requires trust and hard work. 7-1 7 Conclusions \\nAviation safety has benefitted immensely from developing a trust between industry and government, enabled by the successful partnership, a strong commitment to implementing SMS, and a positive safety culture. Given the similarities between air and rail transportation, a similar approach could benefit rail safety. This paper offers lessons learned from aviation, provides examples of technology and other investments to augment causal analysis, and raises the need for shifts in culture and legal and regulatory frameworks. SMS implementation and the adoption of a safety culture require commitment and dedication. Behavioral and technological change hinges on continued maintenance and investment in SMS implementation and safety culture commitment. Developing and nurturing trust between industry, labor, and government lead to new policies, increased reporting of safety-related incidents, insight into causal factors, and data-driven decisions on effective mitigations. There is evidence of some shifting in the rail domain, and continued evolution is needed. Finally, while evidence of working partnerships built in the rail industry has led to some success, the dynamic seems to retain the authoritative role of the regulator and the emphasis on inspection. With the increasing adoption of high technology in railroading, an opportunity exists for rail safety to borrow from the modal similarities and lessons learned over the past 20 years in aviation safety. A significant amount of industry attention has been on PTC and its design, benefits, and challenges, with little discussion looking at the change implications and the potential for revealing new safety risks, or the value of the data generated by PTC and similar systems [56]. With the improved development and implementation of PTC, the potential to take a collaborative approach could be used to proactively determine and control the emerging risks associated with the advent of PTC. Additionally, the opportunity to tailor the system design to support advanced, collaborative safety analytics could allow railroads to realize secondary benefits of the system, beyond the current designs. Data regarding track locations, locomotive and train location and performance, signal and switch status, PTC settings and performance, and corridor scheduling could all contribute to identifying the risks for rail operations. A collaborative approach to rail safety is underway, and through targeted measures, time, and commitment this approach seems likely to achieve reduced accident rates. 8-1 8 References [1] E.
