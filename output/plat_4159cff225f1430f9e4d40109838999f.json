  "text": "for \\nthe IM PA monitoring task. The other controller suggested it should be user-toggleable. To determine if there was a statistically significant difference between controller responses to \\nthe two types of alerts, a paired-sample T-Test analysis was run on the TRACON controller \\nagreement ratings for the following two questions: The IM PA Predictive Alert was useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task.\\nThe IM PA Caution Alert was useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task. The descriptive statistics (n, M, and SD) for each question are shown in Table 5-47. The \\nprobability of finding an effect when there was none, alpha (), was set to 0.05. A one-\\ntailed, paired sample T-Test was used in this case as it was expected that if a difference \\nwould be observed, it would only be in one direction (i.e., based on their respective \\nrequired response procedures, the Predictive Alert would not be expected to be more \\nuseful than the Caution Alert). The results of the one-tailed T-Test analysis resulted in a \\nstatistically significant p = 0.04. This suggests a significant difference in controller \\nagreement with respect to the usefulness of the two elements. Though both were found \\nuseful, stronger agreement was observed with the Caution Alert. Conclusion: This hypothesis is supported by the simulation results. On average, controllers \\nfound the CSL and WSL lines useful for the IM PA monitoring task and recommended that they \\nalways be displayed. They also recommended that the Predictive and Caution Alerts were useful \\nand should also always be active for the monitoring task, though responses were more variable \\nfor the Predictive Alert than the Caution Alert. H5(RQ4): Controllers will find features such as Lateral Boundaries and an 6.8.5\\nExceedance Warning useful to alert them to IM Lead Aircraft and IM Trail \\nAircraft lateral path deviations. The first part of this hypothesis was measured via responses to questions related to usefulness \\nof the Lateral Boundary feature. As described in Section 5.6.3, at the end of Day 2 (QT3), a \\nmajority (60%) of TRACON controllers disagreed the Inner and Outer Lateral Bounds were useful cxiii\\n for the overall IM PA monitoring task. As described in Section 5.5.6.1, however, the majority of \\nTRACON controllers thought that the Inner Boundary should always be displayed (80%) and the \\nOuter Boundary should always be displayed (70%) for the IM PA monitoring task after \\nexperiencing the Lateral Deviation scenarios (Figure 5-70). The rest felt the boundaries should \\nbe user toggleable. Also as described in Section 5.6.3, at the end of each Lateral Deviation scenario (QT6), \\ncontrollers were asked if they could easily assess whether aircraft involved in a PA \\noperation were operating within their lateral bounds in the scenario they just \\nexperienced. All (100%) TRACON controllers agreed for every monitor configuration with \\nthe FMA display. With the STARS display, however, a majority agreed for the Combined \\nMonitor (70%), 28R Monitor (67%), and 28L Monitor (50%). To further examine if monitor configuration or display type had an effect on controller \\nagreement to this question, a two-factor, repeated measures ANOVA test was \\nperformed on the data summarized in Table 5-62. Due to the unbalanced sample sizes, \\nthe ANOVA was performed via a regression analysis with the probability of finding an \\neffect when there was none, alpha (), set to 0.05. The results are shown in Table 5-74. Table 5-74. Controller Post-Run Lateral Boundary Assessment: ANOVA Results SS df MS F p-value Significant?\\nMonitor Configuration 136.8 2 68.42 0.18 0.84 no Display Type 9879.0 1 9879.01 25.79 0.00001 yes\\nInteractions 145.6 2 72.80 0.19 0.83 no Within 18384.4 48 383.01\\nTotal 28671.0 53 540.96 The statistical analysis results from the simulation suggest there was a significant difference \\nwith respect to display Type (p < 0.01) for controller response for whether they could \\nassess if aircraft involved in an IM PA operation were operating within their Lateral \\nBoundaries. No difference was observed with respect to monitor configuration (p = \\n0.84), nor were there any interaction effects (p = 0.83). The results suggest controllers \\nfound that the FMA display aided in their Lateral Boundary assessment, but that the \\nassessment was not affected by the monitor configuration. --------------------------------- The second part of this hypothesis was measured via responses to questions related to the \\nusefulness of the Exceedance Warning feature. As described in Section 5.5.6.1, participants \\nappeared to find the Exceedance Warning useful. As shown in Figure 5-70, all (100%) TRACON \\ncontrollers felt the red LAT in the data block should always be displayed. A majority (90%) \\nthought the Boundary Line color change to red should always occur. As described in Section 5.6.4, at the end of each Lateral Deviation scenario (QT6), controllers \\nwere asked if they had sufficient time and situational awareness to choose and execute \\nappropriate corrective action once the warning (red) alert occurred in the scenario they cxiv\\n just experienced. All (100%) TRACON controllers agreed for both display types in the 28L \\nposition. A majority (89%) of TRACON controllers agreed for both display types in the \\n28R position. For the Combined Monitor configuration, a majority (70%) agreed for the \\nSTARS display and a majority (90%) also agreed for the FMA display. Of interest as well was whether a predictive-type alert would have been helpful or essential \\nfor giving controllers advance notice of a potential Lateral Boundary exceedance. To \\ndetermine if there was a statistically significant difference between controller responses, \\na paired-sample T-Test analysis was run on the TRACON controller agreement ratings for \\ntwo separate questions asking if advance notice of an impending exceedance of the \\nlateral bounds would have been helpful or essential. The descriptive statistics (n, M, \\nand SD) for each question are shown in Table 5-64. The probability of finding an effect \\nwhen there was none, alpha (), was set to 0.05. A one-tailed, paired-samples T-Test \\nwas used in this case as it was expected that if a difference would be observed, it would \\nonly be in one direction (i.e., it was unlikely that if such a predictive-type alert would be \\nfound essential but not helpful). The one-tailed T-Test analysis resulted in a statistically \\nsignificant p = 0.008. This suggests a significant difference in controller agreement \\nresponse. Though controllers agreed for both, stronger agreement was observed for a \\npredictive-type alert for lateral deviations being only helpful. Conclusion: This hypothesis is supported by the simulation results. Overall, controllers appeared \\nto find the Lateral Boundaries useful, especially with the FMA display. They also found the \\nExceedance Warning useful and provided sufficient time and situational awareness to choose \\nand execute appropriate corrective action when needed. A predictive-type Exceedance Warning \\nis likely to be more helpful than essential. H6(RQ5): Though the workload may be increased, a single, combined Monitor 6.8.6\\ncontroller can effectively and acceptably provide separation for CSPR finals \\ninvolving IM PA operations, including separation between successive PA pairs. The first part of this hypothesis was measured via responses to questions pertaining to \\nworkload between the two monitor configurations. As described in Section 5.5.1.1, the Week 2-\\n3 TRACON controllers reported low workload for all three Monitor controller positions. No \\npractical workload difference was observed between the Combined and Separate Monitor \\nconfigurations. As described in Section 5.4.1, after experiencing the Nominal scenarios, all Week \\n2-3 TRACON controllers agreed their overall workload was acceptable for both the Combined \\nand Separate Monitor configurations. A similar result was observed after the Lateral Deviation \\nscenarios as the majority (90%) of TRACON controllers agreed their workload was acceptable \\nacross all display types and monitor configurations (Section 5.6.1). Despite this, some workload \\nconcerns were raised in the comments regarding a Combined Monitors ability to intervene with \\ntwo aircraft that deviate nearly simultaneously. Overall, however, controller responses did not \\nsuggest an appreciable difference in workload between the two monitor configurations. --------------------------------- The second part of this hypothesis was measured via responses to several questions regarding cxv\\n the controllers ability to provide separation with respect to aircraft type and monitor \\nconfiguration. First, as described in Section 5.2.6, all (100%) TRACON controllers agreed the \\ntasks required of the Separate 28R and 28L Monitor positions were acceptable. In the \\nCombined Monitor configuration, the majority (90%) of TRACON controllers agreed. As described in Section 5.4.3, all Week 2-3 TRACON controllers agreed they were able to detect \\nin a sufficient amount of time when spacing / separation issues were developing Within an IM \\nPA Aircraft Pair and Between Other Combinations for both monitor configurations. Though no \\npractical differences were observed in the responses between the two monitor configurations, \\nthe means were slightly higher and overall response variability was slightly lower for IM PA pairs \\nversus other aircraft pair combinations. This was likely due to not having ATPA functionality \\navailable in the HITL to assess separation between the non-IM PA pairs. This self-assessment for IM PA was supported by the objective separation analysis in Section \\n5.2.5.2, which found only a single instance of a within-pair IM PA separation violation. With \\nrespect to between-pair separation, it should first be noted ATPA functionality and data block \\nweight category information (other than identifying Heavy aircraft) were not present in the \\nsimulation",
