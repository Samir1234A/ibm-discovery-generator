While some of these proposals were incorporated in EOs and agency initiatives, most of \\nthese recommendations failed to secure Congressional action and remained aspirational \\nat the end of the previous Administration, and some which were adopted in 2016 were \\nsummarily reversed on January 20, 2017 and by EO 13800 later in 2017. It is a well-recognized principal of policy under our federal rgime that Congressional \\nactionadoption of legislation and its codification in Federal public law-- is preferable to \\npresidential actions, whether through executive order or memoranda, which by their \\nnature are limited in effect to the conduct of Federal agencies under Article II authority, \\nand do not reach the conduct of states, localities or individual citizens. In Information and Communications Technologies, the scope and scale of local interest \\nis large, and growing. Studies in 2010-2015 report sub-federal ICT investments in the \\n$70-75 billion range, expected to have reached at least $78 billion by 2017, and \\ndestined to pass $100 billion annually by 2020.7 The scope of the sub-federal interest is \\nthus large, and growing. Yet the domains of interest of state policy action, especially \\nstatutory action, to date have been limited to squeaky wheel responses, addressing \\nnotorious issues such as cybercrime and data breach notification. In fact, the areas of concern, and of potentially harmful behavior resulting in injury to \\ncitizens and economic loss reach far beyond these tip of the iceberg issues and include \\nthe entire scope of ICT reliance in personal and business activities of citizens, as well as \\nthe reliance of state and local institutions on ICT to assure their proper conduct. http://www.comproinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CPI_Market-Insight_State-and-Local-Government-IT.pdf\\nhttp://www.comproinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CPI_Market-Insight_State-and-Local-Government-IT.pdf\\nhttps://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/09/executive-order-commission-enhancing-national-cybersecurity\\nhttps://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/09/executive-order-commission-enhancing-national-cybersecurity\\nhttps://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/09/executive-order-commission-enhancing-national-cybersecurity\\nhttps://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/428904900\\nhttps://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/428904900 Failures of technology, abuses, frauds and un-remediated anomalous functioning all \\nmay contribute to economic AND physical harm. And in many instances, these harms \\noccur without remedy, as slow or absent Federal policy fails to keep pace with exploding \\npresence of ICT in local Critical Infrastructures, local businesses, workplaces, highways \\nand homes. Framework for Action There are 4 areas of sub-federal interest which are ripe for addressing through \\nlegislative and structural revisions of current practice which from a cost-benefit \\nperspective may reap enormous benefits to the state and local ICT infrastructure, that of \\ndependent non-governmental entities and individual citizens. Undo Federal pre-emption of civil suits for regulated connected (IOT) 1.\\ndevices Improve action against ICT vendor sharp practices and insider fraud by 2.\\nestablishing local expert investigative bodies such as emerging state and local \\nInspectors General Modernize local government contracting for technology3. 4. Use the 79 existing multi-jurisdictional state-operated Fusion Centers to share \\ninformation regarding cyber-attacks, system failures and vulnerabilities across \\nstates Once a critical mass of consensus on these approaches is reached in the state and local \\ncommunity, the framework of authorities and organizational structures to implement \\nthem could be formalized and harmonized thru a uniform state statute to be developed \\nby the Uniform Law Commission/National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform \\nState Laws) (ULC/NCCUSL). Individual tailoring could readily be accomplished to \\nrespond to unique local environments or interests, such as the presence of significant \\nindustries (financial services in New York, media and technology in California). Lets briefly examine each of these 4 proposed areas for state ICT policy action. Reverse existing Federal preemption of state civil jurisdiction for IOT injuries The first element of the proposed 4-part framework for improving the state ICT \\nenvironment deals with absence of clear Federal guidance regarding the explosion of \\nthe Internet of Things and the connectivity of every manner of device to the global IT \\nnetwork. A variety of connected devicesdevices operating on global networks as part of the \\nInternet of Things (IOT)--are subject to federal regulation; as a result, injured individuals \\nwho may wish to seek a remedy from the vendor of a failed devicea manufacturer of \\nan unmanned vehicle, or of a connected medical device, or of an electrical appliance 8 An excellent review of the case law on Federal preemption of state tort jurisdiction for FDA-regulated products is \\nfound at Marcia Boumil, FDA Approval of Drugs and Devices: Preemption of State Laws for Parallel Tort Claims, 18 \\nJ. Health Care L. & Pol'y 1. Available at: http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/jhclp/vol18/iss1/2 which malfunctions and causes harm may find their path to a judgement is blocked by \\nthe Federal regulatory scheme. For example, under present Federal law administered by HHS Food and Drug \\nAdministration (FDA), connected medical devicesparticularly Class III medical devices \\nwhose operation might directly impact patient safety and the failure of which might result \\nin serious injury or death--are regulated by HHS FDA under the Food, Drug and \\nCosmetics Act (FDCA) and its related Medical Device Amendments (MDA). Both the \\nstatutory framework and associated jurisprudence with regard to the issue of state tort \\nliability of drug manufacturers and device manufacturers for claims of damage in state \\ncivil litigation are convoluted, evolving and nearly silent on the specific issue of \\ntechnology injuries. These are injuries resulting not from a failure of an FDA-regulated \\ndevice to conform to its traditional FDCA safety and efficacy requirements, but from \\nharm resulting from a software error, connectivity failure or other cyber fault unique to \\nthe fact of the devices connection to a network by which its functioning can be \\ncontrolled, monitored and impaired. For much of the FDA regulatory landscape, including branded and generic drugs and \\nmany medical devices, the statutory schemes and jurisprudence have identifiable \\ncenters of gravity which can be summarized as three classes of federal preemption \\narticulated in the Supreme Courts opinions in several cases since 2009 (express, \\nimplied and obstruction preemption).8 Particularly for the many existing and emerging devices which can provide life-\\nsustaining functionality of essential physiological systems, largely falling under Class III \\npre- and post-market agency reviews, the issue of regulatory compliance is based on \\nthe devices medical functionality and safety: does the infusion pump deliver the proper \\nvolume of medication at the proper intervals, does the oxygen concentrator resist \\ncontamination, will the defibrillator continue to deliver accurate voltage during a power \\nfailure ? FDA regulatory review of these thousands of different devices, deployed to millions of \\nhealth providers and individual patients have historically NOT been structured to \\ndetermine if the devices have reliable networking software, are secure from external \\nattacks and malicious tampering because of effective firewalls and encryption, or \\npossess access controls which prevent unauthorized individuals from interacting with \\nthe device and the patient. The various state tort liability statutes indeed seem to permit an individual to commence \\na suit for injury against a device manufacturer; however, withstanding a motion to \\ndismiss based on federal statutory direction of regulatory preemption is far less certain \\nand has produced a line of cases across multiple jurisdictions, with multiple Supreme \\nCourt reviews detailed in the Boumil article which in sum lead to the conventional http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/jhclp/vol18/iss1/2 wisdom that such suits are preempted by federal law. The resulting barrier to remedy for these thousands of injured individuals works an \\nobvious unfairness, especially when the failure was related to an aspect of the device \\nnot subject to the Federal regulatory agency review. Even those agencies which are \\nbeginning to address technology flaws such as bad software, counterfeit chips and failed \\nnetwork security are doing so prospectively, meaning, for example in the case of \\nconnected medical devices that millions of devices may be in use, connected to \\nnetworks but never having been subject to expert review to identify flaws and failures of \\nthese network functions. The result is an environment where citizens injured by network-rooted failures of these \\ndevices may be left with no recourse other than a complaint to the regulatory agency, \\nwith unlikely prospects of being made whole, particularly where the harm was not simple \\neconomic loss, but physical injury or death. The solution to this uncertain, unfair and potentially catastrophic limitation of jurisdiction \\nis to counter it with a statutory grant of specific jurisdiction at the state level with \\nparticular reference to the federal regulatory rgimes and focused specifically on \\ndevices where the software and network connectivity capabilities of the devices were \\nnever reviewed by the Federal regulatory agency. Improve contracting for information & communications technology devices, software, \\nservices The second promising area for state action is one which recognizes the economic reality \\nof the information economy. While we are quick to describe the cyber ecosystem as a \\ncreature of invisible bits and bytes moving virtually undetected across the almost \\nmythical world wide web, the fact is that the devices and appliances which enable this \\ntraffic, and its associated trillions of dollars worth of commerce and other economic \\nactivity itself constitutes an enormous economic force. As discussed earlier, according to Gartner and other surveys since 2010,",

A challenge in one country now presents a challenge for the world. In \\ncyberspace, on the battlefield, in hospitals, cities, courts, financial systems, in the air and beyond, we are truly a global ecosystem. MITRE is uniquely qualified to meet the challenges of todays world. With our own ecosystem of seven federally funded research and development centers, we are able to look across the federal government and the globe to the benefit of all of our sponsors. We serve as an innovation bridgeconnecting sponsors to sponsors, solutions to problems, technology to industry, and partners to opportunities. This year our sponsors celebrated a number of significant accomplishments. Whether safeguarding the United States from missile debris, protecting our assets in physical space and cyberspace, empowering patients and veterans, increasing the speed of justice and the economy, or ensuring safe and secure air travel, MITRE was instrumental in helping our sponsors achieve mission success. Our Innovation Program is the cornerstone of these successes, and we continue to break new ground as we seek to solve the problems of tomorrow today. This years MITRE Challenge of Countering Unauthorized Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) brought participants from around the world, and weve just recently launched our second challenge on the Unique Identification of Internet of Things Devices. This year also marked change within our organization: our Board named Dr. John Hamre, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense, to serve as Chairman. John has served on the Board since 2000, and he has brought to MITRE a remarkable understanding of national security issues at the highest levels. MITRE will be well served by his deep knowledge and experience. John succeeds The Honorable Charles Robb, who is retiring after 15 years with MITREservice that came after a distinguished political career of more than a quarter century. We will miss his wisdom and guidance and are grateful for his service. Finally, we were pleased to open the doors to our newest McLean campus building in 2016. MITRE 4 is a modern, green facility with cutting-edge laboratories and collaborative spaces for employees and guests. In the pages ahead, we take a closer look at the challenges of 2016 and beyond and our contributions to our sponsors and international partners successes within this global ecosystem in which we work.
