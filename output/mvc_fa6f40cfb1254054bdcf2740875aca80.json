  "text": "disincentive for managers to support \\nthe mobility of their staff A talent marketplace approach could \\npotentially be leveraged for building talent \\npools for critical, hard-to-fill positions The government will require substantial \\nresources to develop a fully integrated, robust, \\nand user-friendly talent marketplace 24 Report Symposium on the Federal Workforce for the 21st Century Develop managers to provide \\nongoing, effective, feedback \\nand coaching Purpose and practice: According to HBR, \\norganizations need competent management just \\nas much as they need analytical brilliance and \\nshould invest in strengthening management \\nthroughout the organization 25 In government, the \\nsupervisor life cycleselection, orientation, devel-\\nopment, performance, evaluation, and rewards\\nneeds reform The GAO report Federal Workforce: \\nInappropriate Use of Experts and Consultants at \\nSelected Civilian Agencies notes that federal su-\\npervisors sometimes lack effective skills, such as \\nthe ability to identify, communicate, and help ad-\\ndress employee performance issues 26 Addressing \\nthese needs would benefit from a comprehensive \\napproach to selecting and developing managers to \\nensure a complement of engaged supervisors Agencies are required to train supervisors within \\none year of initial appointment and follow up at \\nleast every three years; nonetheless, a recent \\nOPM survey showed the training results to be \\ninconsistent across agencies The requirement \\nincludes training on the supervisory skills that \\nrelate to mentoring employees, improving \\nemployee performance, conducting appraisals, \\nand identifying unacceptable performance Only \\n84% of agencies self-reported compliance with \\nthe curriculum requirements for new supervisors, \\nand only 63% responded that ongoing supervisory \\ntraining requirements were covered 27 Adjusting performance management practices \\nrequires that supervisors change their own be-\\nhaviors first According to Alan Colquitt, author \\nof Next Generation Performance Management, \\nemployees of companies that have encouraged \\nongoing feedback have reported dissatisfaction; \\nthis is because more feedback does not necessar-\\nily translate into better feedback 28 Organizations \\nneed to train leaders and employees on how to \\ngive and receive feedback, and to shift from judg-\\ning to developmental feedback Compared with the private sector, government employees have a \\nlower perception of their supervisors feedback \\nFEVS data positive responses to the statement \\nMy supervisor provides me with constructive \\nsuggestions to improve my job performance as \\n14% lower in government than in the private sector \\nThe combination of clear expectations, frequent \\nfeedback, training, and coaching may help improve \\nperformance or build the evidence necessary to \\nremove employees with below-par performance Actions:\\nDevelop supervision competency models to include \\nboth technical and management skills, as opposed to \\npromoting based on technical competence alone To inform hiring decisions, use job analyses to doc-\\nument that competencies fundamental for manage-\\nment are present in the assessment Incorporate \\nassessment instruments that evaluate a candidates \\nmanagement-related competencies (e g , oral com-\\nmunication, team building, and coaching) throughout \\nthe selection process Use assessment tools such as \\nrole-playing exercises and panel interviews to assess \\nthese skills Establish an onboarding and probationary period for \\nnewly selected and trained supervisors to assess \\ntheir effectiveness in a people-management role Build leadership positions into the organizational \\nstructure and ensure that employees are given the \\nopportunity to lead projects or tasks Provide adequate training and support for supervisors \\nto help build skills and encourage acceptance of a \\ncoaching culture Allow sufficient time for supervisors to perform their \\nsupervisory duties outside of their technical respon-\\nsibilities and for employees to participate in discus-\\nsions For example, MITRE allocates a budget for both \\nsupervisors and employees to conduct conversations \\nthat relate to performance outside of their usual proj-\\nect work These conversations cover the employees \\ncareer goals, training requests, and opportunities For \\nthe government, such a shift may require a signifi-\\ncant budget commitment, not easily acquired in the \\ncurrent environment Considerations: The government should consider expanding the \\nnumber of nonsupervisory senior leader (SL) \\nand senior technical (ST) positions, of which \\nthere are currently 1,283 (as of March 2018) 29 25The MITRE Corporation Career paths could also be developed for \\nthose employees who are highly skilled \\ntechnically and want to advance but are \\nnot interested or skilled to serve in people-\\nmanagement positions, with a potential goal \\nof SL or ST positions Explore approaches for \\naligning compensation with \\nvalue and performance Purpose and practice: Private sector \\napproaches to performance management suggest \\nreduced emphasis on past ratings Instead \\nthey favor ongoing feedback and performance \\nmeasurement and compensation that is clearly \\ntied to both performance (e g , results) and value \\n(e g , skills and behaviors) Participants discussed \\nperformance management systems that aligned \\nemployee compensation with the roles, results, \\nand behaviors that the employee had exhibited \\nduring the previous performance cycle The \\nprivate sector focuses on compensation aligned \\nto the individual person and what that person \\nhas achieved during the rating cycle as opposed \\nto a ranking and rating system that compares \\nindividuals to peers We recognize that this practice is fundamentally \\ndifferent from the civil service rules in Title 5, \\nwhich require agencies to structure compensation \\nbased on the general schedule (GS) pay levels \\ndescribed in 5 U S C Parts 51 and 53 (i e those \\nassociated with the work performed in the \\nposition) Paying employees based on position \\nis the current standard because it allows for \\nthe execution of Merit Systems Principles that \\nrequire equal pay for equal work However, the \\ncurrent system does not recognize individual \\nemployees for their achievements beyond the \\ninitial qualification standard for the position \\n(e g , employees are not recognized for earning \\nadditional degrees) The result is that while pay \\nmay be relatively equal based on the position, \\nperformance is not equal at an individual level \\nThe goal of equal pay for equal work is an important principle; adding some differentiation \\nbased on performance results and value can \\nfurther strengthen the federal performance and \\ncompensation system and help the government be \\nviewed as a preferred employer for top talent This particularly complex and challenging oppor-\\ntunity requires careful and close collaboration with \\nemployees and labor organizations It does repre-\\nsent a significant trend outside government, and \\nthe government should explore how it might be \\napplied in the federal workplace Actions:\\nExplore compensation approaches that effectively \\nbalance the importance of recognizing employees for \\nindividual accomplishments, skills, and educational \\nadvancement, with the importance of paying for the \\nposition in a way that appropriately compensates \\nequal pay for equal work Review the assessment and validation process that is \\nused in government person-driven systems (e g , the mil-\\nitary model in Title 10 and the Foreign Service in Title 22) Examine state models for hiring, promotion, and \\nperformance management transformations (e g , Tennessee) 30 Considerations: This practice is fundamentally different from \\nthe approach that the federal government has \\ntraditionally taken in setting compensation \\non GS pay levels described in 5 U S C Parts \\n51 and 53, which are executed in the position \\nclassification standards The government pay system dictates the \\ntype of positions that are governed at each \\nlevel on the GS schedule in the U S Code \\nApplying Title 22 or Title 10 principles to \\nthe Title 5 system, which is position driven, \\nrepresents a monumental change that would \\nrequire significant resources to legally defend \\npromotion decisions An essential component of the effectiveness of \\nthis change will be the previous recommenda-\\ntion to develop managers to provide ongoing, \\neffective feedback and coaching to their staff 26 Report Symposium on the Federal Workforce for the 21st Century Continuing the conversation\\nAs OMB continues to take action to execute the workforce strategies in the PMA, there is \\ngreat opportunity to build upon the engagement \\nthat occurred at the symposium We recommend \\nconvening a series of smaller events with cross-\\nsector, topic-based groups periodically during the \\nyear, to work on issues and problems or to focus on \\nspecific recommendations We also recommend \\nholding an annual Federal Workforce Symposium \\nThe annual event can be both a culmination of the \\nprevious years efforts, as well as an opportunity to \\nestablish new focus areas for the coming year The data we gathered from symposium partic-\\nipants and presenters validates that there is no \\nlack of good ideas within and outside the federal \\ngovernment Further, some of these ideas have \\nbeen implemented not just in the private sec- tor, but also within government, in many cases as \\ndemonstration projects or pilots As OMB chooses \\nto test and implement any of these recommenda-\\ntions, it should explore why demonstration proj-\\nects have been minimally effective in generating \\nlessons learned that other organizations can adapt \\nin subsequent efforts Alignment of \\nrecommendations with CAP \\nGoal 3 subgoals \\nAs the government reviews and prioritizes these \\nrecommendations, we recommend considering \\nhow the recommendations and specific, associat-\\ned actions may support the CAP Goal 3 subgoals \\nreferenced in the first section of this report Table \\n1 provides a notional look at how the recommen-\\ndations align to those subgoals CAP GOAL 3, WORKFORCE FOR THE 21ST CENTURYSUBGOALS Symposium Report Recommendations Actively Manage the \\nWorkforce Improve Performance \\nManagement & Engagement Develop Agile \\nOperations Reskill & Redeploy \\nHuman Capital Resources Acquire Top \\nTalent Simple & Strategic \\nHiring Increase use of partnerships for talent \\nexchange programs Expand use of critical hiring authorities \\nUse data science to develop evidence- \\nbased HR strategies \\nExpand use of apprenticeships and \\ndevelopment partnerships \\nBuild training and reskilling into \\ntechnology",
