  "sdl_extracted_summary": "PA to be \\ngenerally acceptable, even after experiencing significant lateral deviations by the Lead Aircraft. \\nThe current IM PA concept appears feasible and MITRE CAASD recommends the FAA continue \\nits development. This study provided initial findings on the initiation of and monitoring of an IM PA operation \\nbased on its current ConOps (FAA, 2017b). The results are intended to provide concept \\nvalidation for the avionics standard development activities and A-IM ConOps, as well as specific \\nrecommendations for the FAA IM Initial Program Requirements document with respect to \\ncontroller information needs and supporting ground tools. These results and recommendations \\nshould be considered by RTCA SC-186, FAA SBS Program Office, FAA Aircraft Certification, and \\nFAA Flight Standards as IM PA proceeds through concept development. Summary of Recommendations8.2\\nBased on the results of the HITL experiment, the following 11 recommendations should be \\nconsidered in the further development of the IM PA concept and air and ground requirements: Concept development should continue based on results suggesting the IM PA 1.\\nlongitudinal and lateral separation monitoring and initiation tasks should be feasible and \\nacceptable to controllers given the appropriate tools and training. Final Approach controllers should have an indication of how close the IM Trail Aircraft is 2.\\nto the safety limits before they initiate the IM PA operation. This could be in the form of \\na preview CSL Line. Further study is recommended as to what may be helpful for wake \\nprotection information. IM PA setup spacing requirements should ensure that between-pair separation can be 3.\\nsufficiently maintained during compression on final. A single Final Monitor controller is likely to be able to monitor across both approaches 4.\\nunder nominal operations. However, further study is needed to examine whether \\nseparate Monitor controllers will be required for safety to manage extreme off-nominal \\nsituations. v\\n Graphic depictions of the CSL and WSL lines should be considered, as opposed to 5.\\nnumeric distances in the data blocks. A WSL-P for relevant aircraft should be considered, appearing as early as possible. 6.\\nFurther study is recommended to determine at what point this may prove confusing and \\ncounterproductive. An alert should be provided for longitudinal monitoring task to indicate when a 7.\\ncontroller must take action to stop an aircraft from exceeding a safety limit. The need for \\na situation awareness alert that does not require action may depend on the facility \\nimplementation and what controllers are able to do in response. Further study is \\nrecommended to optimize the balance between the potential for nuisance alerts and \\nthe time available to take action once an alert is triggered. Strategies for minimizing the \\npotential for sudden state changes should also be considered. For the lateral monitoring task, controllers should be provided an indication for where 8.\\nan aircrafts crosstrack error may result in the CSL and WSL no longer providing the \\nrequired protection from collision or wake risk. The use of a 4:1 FMA display should be \\nconsidered to aid in the controllers lateral deviation assessment. Further examination of the monitoring task and response procedures is recommended 9.\\nfor lateral deviations close to the runway (i.e. past the Lateral Bounds). Controllers should be provided with an alert or warning for when PA separation may no 10.\\nlonger apply due to a lateral deviation by the IM Lead or Trail Aircraft. Its saliency may \\nbe improved by changing the color of the entire data block of the deviating aircraft and \\nchanging the color of a boundary line segment near to the deviation instead of changing \\nthe color of the entire line. Ground tools and procedures need to be fully integrated to ensure that separation 11.\\nbetween aircraft pairs not performing IM PA can be maintained while IM PA operations \\nare in progress. A Final Approach controller or a Monitor controller could be responsible for IM PA, 12.\\ndepending on the facility configuration and further research is recommended with \\nrespect to allowing controllers to manually provide speeds to keep an IM Trail Aircraft \\nwithin the safety limits if the FIM Equipment fails. This must be balanced with the \\npotential for undesirable frequency overrides and workload. Further consideration is recommended for controller and pilot coordination actions and 13.\\ninformation transfer when the IM PA operation appears likely to require an aircraft \\nbreak out. i\\n References9\\nBarmore, B.
