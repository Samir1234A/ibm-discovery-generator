  "text": "participant observed, we are not \\ngood at incentivizing people to move around, and \\nwe do not make it easy from a mobility standpoint Symposium participants discussed a specific \\nchallenge related to learning and development: re-\\nskilling Despite their deep institutional knowledge, \\ndedicated government employees may face evolv-\\ning mission or organizational requirements that \\nhave changed their work and necessitated new \\nskills Many of these reskilling opportunities have \\nsignificant technology components Participants \\nnoted that employees (in any organization, not just \\nin government) may view technology as a threat to \\ntheir job rather than an enabler of their work and \\ntheir agencys mission Finally, budget constraints \\nsometimes lead to reskilling efforts that do not \\nsupport the necessary time or degree of training \\nrequired for employees to master new skills Updating laws and policies to meet \\ncurrent needs Many of the participants said that some \\nexisting laws and policies create particularly \\ncritical challenges for the government The Merit \\nSystem Principles of fair and open competition, \\nWere not harnessing \\nthe data 10 Report Symposium on the Federal Workforce for the 21st Century fair and equitable treatment, and protection \\nagainst personal favoritism are intended to create \\na level playing field and open opportunities for all \\nHowever, the process for posting and competing \\njobs in the government can be frustrating to \\nmanagers when they feel they have identified a \\nquality candidate and want to move quickly The process of developing candidates and building \\ntalent pipelines can also be cumbersome to \\nmanagers, given that career ladders are often \\ndesigned in advance of the competitive process \\nIn contrast, commercial companies may identify \\nhigh potentials (or HiPos) for their leadership \\npotential and nurture their careers with focused \\ndevelopment opportunities as they ascend through \\nmanagement ranks One example of a federal \\nprogram focused on building leadership success is \\nthe Internal Revenue Services (IRS) XD (Executive \\nDevelopment Program) Through this program, the \\nListen to the people doing \\nthe work IRS successfully applies intentional succession \\nand development principles in line with its private \\nsector peers while still following federal laws and \\npolicies But this is not a consistent practice across \\nthe federal government Some symposium participants raised the \\nchallenge of balancing the important goals \\nof Veterans Preference with other objectives \\nunderlying the Merit System, such as fair and \\nopen competition and new opportunities This \\ngenerated much dialogue among participants, \\nwho discussed whether the preference and the \\nopportunity it creates is a one-time preference \\nto facilitate initial government employment or \\na long-term commitment that applies to any \\nopportunity pursued once inside the government \\nSome participants pointed to a proposal by the \\nDepartment of Defense in 2016 that would allow \\nVeterans Preference to be an option only for \\ninitial entry into government 2 While symposium \\nparticipants agreed on the need to explore \\npotential options to restructure the statute, \\nthey also emphasized that any options needed \\nto continue to honor our veterans and identify \\nadditional approaches for helping veterans \\nqualify for jobs and be positioned for growth and \\ndevelopment opportunities The September 2018 \\nNational Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) \\nNo Time to Wait, Part 2 report3 provides additional \\nperspective on this topic and is consistent with \\nsymposium participants suggestions The third aspect of this challenge relates to \\nperformance management, specifically how federal \\nmanagers address below-par performers In the \\nOPM Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS), \\nonly 42% of respondents felt that steps were \\ntaken in their organizations to address below-par \\nperformers This result is consistent across past \\nsurveys One contributing factor, which is not \\nunique to the federal government, is the challenge \\nof helping supervisors learn how to coach and \\ndevelop a struggling employee while maintaining \\nthe productivity and morale of the whole work unit 11The MITRE Corporation Opportunities \\nAs participants shared their experiences, insights, and recommendations for address-\\ning the challenges facing the government, \\nsome clear themes emerged In synthe-\\nsizing the results from the symposium, \\nwe developed the framework in Fig-\\nure 1 to organize captured ideas and \\nrecommendations, and to provide \\nto OMB a model that might prove \\nuseful for future research, engage-\\nment, and action planning The \\nopportunities composing this \\nframework reflect key ideas raised \\nby participants The final section \\nof this report, Recommendations, \\npresents those specific practices or \\nactions that MITRE believes the gov-\\nernment should explore further, in align-\\nment with these opportunities Figure 1. Opportunity Framework and seeking training that is self-enriching versus \\nrelated to job requirements They have set up or \\nare participating in Talent Marketplaces to provide \\nmore options for employees 4 They have revised \\nperformance management and compensation to \\npay for value, not simply performance And they \\nnot only encourage mobility but also build mobility \\ninto their organizational models and career paths \\nto improve the employee experience Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides another \\nexample of a high-performing company focused \\non the employee experience AWS uses tools \\nlike the Connection Survey to continuously pulse \\nemployee satisfaction and engagement, as well \\nas decision models that allow for disagreement \\nbut focus on getting commitment to deliver the \\noutcome All of these examples focus on under-\\nstanding, respecting, and leveraging the strengths, \\nexperiences, and motivations of their people People Shared by symposium speakers and \\nparticipants was the perspective \\nthat leading organizations today \\nput people at the center of their \\nstrategies and focus on enhancing the employee experience and employee value \\nFor many organizations in many sectors, this is a shift from traditional organizational strategies \\nand practices While some might argue that it \\nis always about the people, many examples \\nwere shared that demonstrate that leading \\norganizations are doing more to understand \\nwhat motivates and engages people, as well as \\ndeveloping workforce strategies and programs \\nto align organizational needs and the value \\nproposition for each employee Professional services organizations such as \\nAccenture, Deloitte, McKinsey, and the Boston \\nConsulting Group (BCG), all symposium attendees, \\nhave shifted their models to provide more control \\nto employees in setting their career paths, \\nlooking for and acting on growth opportunities, 12 Report Symposium on the Federal Workforce for the 21st Century In our framework, we place people at the center \\nbecause a people-driven strategy recognizes \\npeople for the skills and value they bring to the \\norganization, aligns incentives to what they value, \\nsupports ongoing growth and development, \\ncreates new opportunities, enables people to \\ndefine and manage their own career paths, and \\nfosters a sense of mission and purpose behind \\nroles and work A people-centric approach is \\nconsistent with all leading practices and leading \\norganizations regardless of their sector 5 Engagement Reflecting on their leadership \\nexperience, industry experts \\nand executives attending the \\nsymposium emphasized that \\nemployee engagement is essential to any change effort that impacts the workforce \\nOrganizations cannot merely inform employees \\nof impending changes; leaders and managers \\nshould communicate early and often, listen to the \\npeople who do the work, and invite employees \\nto be actively involved in designing the solution \\nTo illustrate this type of active involvement, one \\nparticipant shared the example of employee-driven \\nproduct development in a technology organization 6 Participants acknowledged that this is a challenge \\nin all types of organizations Engaging employees \\nrequires commitment and consistency, but \\nresearch shows it also decreases resistance, \\nincreases commitment, and directly contributes \\nto the success of, for example, technology \\nimplementations 7 Symposium participants noted that having a clear \\nand compelling mission is a significant strength for \\nthe government Many employees join the govern-\\nment for the mission, and, as reported in the 2017 \\nFEVS, most federal employees take the values \\nof mission, service, and stewardship seriously \\nThey are dedicated and proud to serve Similarly, \\ngovernment employees are willing to put in extra \\neffort to get a job done In the 2017 FEVS results, \\n95% of respondents reported believing that they \\nThe most important partnership that can be developed and nurtured is [between] management \\nand employees are doing important and valuable work, as opposed \\nto 83% of their private sector peers (per Partner-\\nship for Public Service and Mercer/Sirota) 8 That most government workers believe their work \\nhas purpose is a strong foundation on which to \\nbuild greater engagement and partnership This \\nis particularly important within the context of \\nlabor and management As related at the sym-\\nposium, the experience at the Portsmouth Naval \\nShipyard demonstrates that building productive, \\nsustainable working relationships is possible when \\nall parties focus on common values and goals In \\nthis example, collaboration between labor and \\nmanagement built trust, provided a foundation \\nfor decision-making, and helped those involved 13The MITRE Corporation navigate through the disagreements and challeng-\\nes that inevitably arose In this case, transparent \\ncommunication and active engagement resulted \\nin measurable performance gains for the shipyard Learning and development In the public and private sectors, \\nemployees perceptions of learning \\nand career growth opportunities \\n(or lack thereof) have emerged \\nas a major retention factor, along with the conventional wisdom of satisfaction \\nwith pay and immediate supervisor 9 As one \\nparticipant noted, Career opportunitiesthe \\nability to progress in ones careeris one of the \\nmain drivers of employee satisfaction and a key \\nissue for maintaining a satisfied and productive \\nworkforce As such, symposium attendees across \\nall sectors reported using a variety of strategies \\nto increase retention of valued",
