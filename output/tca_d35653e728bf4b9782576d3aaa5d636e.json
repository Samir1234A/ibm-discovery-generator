  "text": "of the approach, \\nthere is the potential for controllers to be surprised by a pop-up WSL value. This surprise could \\nbe mitigated by a preview or pre-activation feature; however, the underlying WSL should be \\npredictable over time and therefore this additional display feature could be considered display \\nclutter by controllers. It is therefore hypothesized that a WSL pre-activation feature may be \\nuseful, but not a minimum requirement. H3(RQ3): Controllers will find a WSL Pre-Activation indication and distances to the CSL and WSL \\nuseful, but not minimum requirements. As the IM PA inter-pair spacing will be smaller than what controllers are used to today, and \\nbecause the controller will be required to take action before an IM PA Aircraft longitudinally \\nencroaches on either the WSL or CSL, it is expected that alerting will be helpful to controllers to \\nindicate when an intervention is required. Based on the fielded ATPA Phase 1 alert \\nimplementation described in Section 2.3.2.2, it is hypothesized that a similar IM PA two-level \\nalerting scheme will be acceptable to controllers. H4(RQ3): A representation of the safety limits and an alert when the IM Trail Aircraft begins to \\nencroach on the limits will be useful to Monitor controllers. RQ4: What types of information and display features will controllers need to monitor IM PA \\noperations for lateral deviations from the intended flight path? Past research results suggest that similar to SOIA, the lateral monitoring task is enhanced by an \\nNTZ-like area and associated alerting to indicate when controller action is needed to resolve a \\nlateral deviation (Mendolia, et al., 2016). As noted in Section 2.2.3, the CSL and WSL were \\ndesigned to accommodate some amount of normal aircraft crosstrack error from the approach iv\\n path centerline. Although controllers are not required to detect lateral deviations and break out \\none of the aircraft in an IM PA pair before the other crosses its path, they are expected to find it \\nhelpful to be informed as to when an aircrafts crosstrack error may result in the CSL and WSL \\nno longer providing the required protection from collision or wake risk. Therefore, as with SOIA \\noperations and their associated NTZ, controllers are hypothesized to find useful a display \\nelement to indicate when they need to take action based on a lateral deviation. Also, controllers \\nare hypothesized to find useful an automated warning to draw their attention to the deviation. H5(RQ4): Controllers will find features such as Lateral Boundaries and an Exceedance Warning \\nuseful to alert them to IM Lead Aircraft and IM Trail Aircraft lateral path deviations. RQ5: Can a single, combined Monitor controller effectively monitor an IM PA operation?\\nPast research results suggest that similar to SOIA, dedicated Monitor controllers providing IM \\nPA separation would be the preferred implementation at NCT/SFO (Mendolia, et al., 2016). As \\ndescribed in Section 2.3.2, current operations such as SOIA require separate Monitor \\ncontrollers, each with transmit / receive and override capability on the respective final approach \\nfrequency, to ensure aircraft do not penetrate the depicted NTZ. This is possible at SFO because \\nseparate L/R Final Approach controllers work the finals and aircraft are navigating visually for \\nthe last portion of the approach. At this point, the aircraft no longer require Monitor controllers \\nto provide separation and are transferred to the single Local controller. IM PA, however, is intended for operations in IMC and may not be able to accommodate visual \\nseparation during the final portion of the approach. Implementing separate L/R Monitor \\ncontrollers, as would be required by current 7110.65 rules (FAA, 2017a), may thus not be \\npractical or feasible at SFO. It is therefore of interest to determine whether a single, combined \\nMonitor controller can effectively provide separation for CSPR finals involving IM PA operations \\nover a relatively long final approach segment. Facilities with dependent parallel runway operations typically employ separate L/R Final \\nApproach controllers due to the workload involved in vectoring aircraft to final and other \\nintensive tasks. Todays Monitor controller workload, however, is much reduced as they are \\nonly required to take action if an aircraft penetrates the NTZ. Workload for the IM PA concept \\nas tested in the HITL may be higher, as the Monitor controllers must provide separation for all \\naircraft on the approach, including within and between IM PA pairs, and must monitor for \\nlateral deviations. However, IM PA will likely involve alerting to tell controllers when to take \\naction for an impending loss of IM PA separation. Therefore, if vectoring to final (or managing \\naircraft on RNAV paths that connect to the final) remains the responsibility of Final Approach \\ncontrollers, it is hypothesized that a single Monitor controller can effectively and acceptably \\nMonitor separation for IM PA and non-IM PA aircraft over the course of a long final approach \\nsegment. H6(RQ5): Though the workload may be increased, a single, combined Monitor controller can \\neffectively and acceptably provide separation for CSPR finals involving IM PA operations, \\nincluding separation between successive PA pairs. RQ6: Is it feasible and acceptable to use Partial IM Clearance procedures to initiate an IM PA \\noperation? Prior PA HITL research such as Domino, Tuomey, Stassen, & Mundra (2014) and Mendolia, et al. v\\n (2016) examined the use of an expect message to provide IM PA setup information before the \\noperation was intended to begin. Controller results suggested that clearance formulation in this \\nmanner was acceptable, though issues were raised with respect to the length of the \\nphraseology as described in Section 2.4.2. The use of expect was modified during concept \\ndevelopment to the use of a Partial IM Clearance summarized in Section 2.2.1. More fully \\ndescribed in FAA (2017b) and RTCA (2019a), the intent of the Partial IM Clearance was generally \\nthe same as the expect message and the sequence of communications and information \\ntransfers is similar. It is therefore hypothesized that Final controllers will find the IM PA \\ninitiation task, including the use of Partial IM Clearance procedures, acceptable. H7(RQ6): Final controllers will find the IM PA initiation task, including the use of the Partial IM \\nClearance, acceptable. i\\n Experiment Methodology5\\nThe purpose of this HITL experiment was to evaluate the terminal controller monitoring task for \\nIM PA pairs established on final, especially with respect to minimum and maximum separation \\nlimits that change over the course of an approach. In addition, it evaluated alternative \\nsupporting display features to facilitate this monitoring task and the use of Partial IM Clearance \\nprocedures to initiate IM PA operations on final. This section details the simulation \\nenvironment, prototype ground tools developed for the evaluation, IM PA concept \\nimplementation as tested including controller roles and responsibilities, and the experimental \\ndesign. Simulation Environment5.1\\nThe HITL was conducted in the MITRE Aviation Integration Demonstration and Experimentation \\nfor Aeronautics (IDEA) Laboratory at the MITRE McLean campus. The simulation utilized \\ncontroller and pseudopilot workstations that incorporated new display features as necessary for \\nthis evaluation. An overview of the capabilities and workstations are provided below. Controller Workstation5.1.1\\nThe ATC interface consisted of a representative 2K display that hosted an interface similar to the \\ncurrently fielded STARS system. The display contained an SFO terminal map and the same \\ndisplay and features were available to both the Monitor controller(s) and Final Approach \\ncontroller and is shown in Figure 4-1. Some of the IM PA features are depicted in the figure and \\nare described in Section 4.2. ATPA and Wake RECAT aircraft categories were not available to \\ncontrollers on the display; however, other tools such as bats and Predicted Track Lines (PTLs) \\ncould be toggled on or off. The workstation contained the majority of the basic STARS \\nfunctionality and used a typical STARS keyboard and trackball. Special keyboard entries were \\nprogrammed to serve as unique IM PA functions (described in Section 4.2.2). ii\\n 7 This figure first appeared in Mendolia, et al. (2016). Figure 4-1. STARS Display used in the HITL Experiment (with IM PA Display Features) Pseudopilot and Confederate Controller Workstations5.1.2\\nAircraft in the HITL were piloted by pseudopilots, which allowed the controller participants to \\ninteract normally with the traffic. The pseudopilots input the controller participant instructions \\ninto an interface termed Simpilot as shown in Figure 4-27, which allowed for the simultaneous \\ncontrol of multiple simulated aircraft. The HITL scenarios also required the use of a confederate \\nto act as a Local (Tower) Controller. This Confederate Controller communicated directly with the \\npseudopilots on the voice frequency, which the participant Monitor controllers could listen to \\nand override as needed. HITL scenarios involved different roles and configurations for the \\nparticipant controllers. This required different configurations and communications loops for the \\npseudopilots and confederate controllers as described in Section 4.1.3. iii\\n Figure 4-2. Pseudopilot Interface (Simpilot) Communications Environments5.1.3\\nVarious communications configurations were used during the HITL, depending on whether \\nparticipant controllers managed traffic as combined or separate monitors, as described in \\nSection 4.3. Figure 4-3 shows the communications environment for the Combined Monitor \\nconfiguration. Two separate loops were created: the first for the 28L/R Combined Monitor \\ncontroller (participant), who monitored the frequency with a Combined 28L/R Local controller \\nand the pseudopilot managing the traffic arriving to",
