The rates are shown in Table 4-21. The rates were similar for the two\\ntool sets. The rate of IM speeds per minute was higher with less variance for the achieve-by\\nstage (M = 2.1; SD = 0.6) as compared to the maintain stage (M = 1.5; SD = 1.3). The rates for\\nthe stages and tool set are shown in Figure 4-18. 4-25 Table 4-21.

As can be seen in the\\nachieve-by stage figures, the speed are less frequent further out (e.g., 45 30 NM), then\\nbecome more frequent (30 15 NM), and are most frequent close to the ABP. Figure 4-21 for\\nthe maintain stage, shows the IM speeds to be fairly evenly distributed across the entirety of\\nthe stage (note the different scale based on the maintain stage being conducted for a shorter\\namount of time). 4-26 Figure 4-19.

Distribution of IM Speeds for Maintain Stage 4-27 4.4.5.2 Magnitude of IM speeds\\nThe average magnitude difference between IM speeds was 6.4 knots (SD=2.3) (Table 4-22). As\\nnoted in Section 3.1.2, the algorithm was designed to present the IM speeds in 10 kt\\nincrements when greater than 10 NM from the ABP, and in 5 kt increments when less than 10\\nNM from the ABP and when in the maintain stage. As would be expected then, the magnitude\\nchanges were higher for the achieve-by stage (M=6.6; SD=2.3) with 5 and 10-knot increments\\nthan the maintain stage (M=5.0; SD=0.0) with only 5-knot increments. The magnitude changes\\nwere similar for the two tool sets. Figure 4-22 shows the distribution of the speed changes and\\nthe transitions at 10 miles from the ABP for the two different ABPs. The 5 and 10-kt increment\\nschedules can be clearly seen. Table 4-22.

Of the 31 speed reversals,\\ntwenty-nine were a speed decrease followed by a speed increase. On average, 2% (24 of 1113)\\nof IM speeds were speed reversals in the achieve stage of the IM operation and 0.6% (7/1113)\\nin the maintain stage. However, when considering the percentage of speeds only associated\\nwith the stages, fewer speed reversals occurred with the achieve-by stage (24/995; 2.4%) as\\ncompared to the maintain stage (7/118; 5.9%) (Table 4-23). Additionally, fewer speed reversals\\noccurred with the min+ tool set (31/534; 2.6%) as compared to the min tool set (17/579; 2.9%).\\nFigure 4-23 and Figure 4-24 show the locations of the reversals for the tool sets and stages.

When considering the percentage of speeds only associated\\nwith the stages, fewer speed increases occurred with achieve-by stage (150/995; 15.1%) as\\ncompared to maintain stage (44/118; 37.3%). Additionally, fewer speed increases occurred for\\nthe Min+ tool set (86/534; 16.1%) as compared to the min tool set (108/579; 18.7%) Table 4-24.

Most of the\\ntimes between IM speeds were between 6 second (10th percentile) and 87.9 second (90th\\npercentile). There was more time between IM speeds for the achieve-by stage (32.3) than for\\nthe maintain stage (26.1). There was also more time between speed changes for the min+ tool\\nset (32.7) than there was for the min tool set (25.7). Table 4-25.

Figure 4-25 and Figure 4-26 show the relationship between the time between IM\\nspeeds and the distance to the ABP and PTP. The dots show specific events and the blue line is a\\ncurved of best fit. The bars on top and right side of the graph show frequencies of events for\\ndistance to the PTP (top) and time between IM speeds (right). Figure 4-25 shows that relationship when the participant flight crew flew the achieve-by IM\\nclearance with YOKXO as the ABP (and PTP). Figure 4-26 shows that relationship when the\\nparticipant flight crew flew the achieve-by then maintain IM clearance with DERVL as the ABP\\n(and YOKXO as the PTP). As can be seen in both figures, IM speeds were generally closer\\ntogether and occurred more often when close to the ABP. The speeds were closest in time and\\nmost frequent when the aircraft was about 10 miles to the ABP for the achieve-by IM clearance\\nand about 5 miles from the ABP for the achieve-by then maintain IM clearance. 4-31 Figure 4-25. Scatterplot of Time Between IM Speeds and Distance to the PTP with FAF /\\nYOKXO as ABP (Achieve-by Clearance Type) Figure 4-26. Scatterplot of Time between IM Speeds and Distance to the PTP with Merge /\\nDERVL as ABP (Achieve-by then Maintain Clearance Type) 4-32 4.4.5.6 Compliance with IM Speeds\\nCompliance with IM speeds is defined as the participant flight crew dialing in the IM speed in\\nthe MCP speed window. For the simulation, the flight crew was considered to be in compliance\\nwith the IM speed if the speed set in the MCP speed window was within 2 kts of the IM speed14. As shown in Table 4-26, flight crews complied with more IM speeds when in the achieve-by\\nstage (76.6%) than when in the maintain stage (70.3%) and with the min+ tool set (79.2%) than\\nthe min tool set (72.9%). However, the statistical test noted in Section 4.1.3.2, did not reveal a\\nstatistically significant difference between the two tool sets. When flight crews complied with IM speeds, the IM speeds had been presented for a longer\\nperiod of time (M=40.6; SD=41.4) (Table 4-27 and Figure 4-27). When flight crews did not\\ncomply with IM speeds, the IM speeds had been presented for a shorter period of time (M=7.9;\\nSD=10.2). Table 4-26.

Mean Duration of IM Speed Presentation Time as Related to Compliance 4.4.5.7 IM Speed Conformance Monitoring Advisory\\nOut of 73 runs, thirty-eight (52%) had at least one IM speed conformance monitoring advisory.\\nThere were a total of 160 advisories accounting for 14% (160 of 1113) of IM speeds. The 160\\nadvisories were associated with 119 IM speeds: 86 (72.3%) were for one IM speed and 33\\n(27.7%) were for the same IM speed15. For all advisories, fewer occurred with the min+ tool set (61/534; 11.4%) as compared to the\\nmin tool set (99/579; 17.1%) (Table 4-28). Figure 4-28 shows the location of the advisories for\\nthe",
