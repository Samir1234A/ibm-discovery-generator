  "text": "conformance monitoring appeared sufficient for informing the flight crew of\\nthe need to check the IAS against the IM speed. However, consideration should be given to the\\nimplementation utilized in this simulation that (unintentionally) alerted more often than\\nspecified in DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a). Several past simulations have reported a pilot desire for, or\\nbetter performance with, more salient notifications (i.e., better visual indications or aural\\nalerts) for each new IM speed (e.g., Bone et al., 2003; Penhallegon et al., 2011; Baxley et al.,\\n2013; Swieringa et al., 2014). More salient notifications are desirable and would reduce the\\ntime necessary to monitor IM displays. Features such as an aural alert for each new IM speed\\nmay be too intrusive, especially when the speeds are frequent. Therefore, the following\\nrecommendation is made: Continue the examination of the most appropriate scheme for alerting to the\\nconformance to IM speeds. If an aural alert is considered too intrusive, testing should\\ninclude sufficiently salient notifications that do not require excessive monitoring of the IM\\ndisplays. While pilot opinions were mixed as to whether the graphical progress indicator should be a\\nminimum requirement, the feedback on this one question should be considered in light of 6-5 simulation issues, other feedback on the tool, and past work. All major IM HITL simulation\\nefforts ended up requiring or trying to perfect this type of feature (e.g., Bone et al., 2003;\\nHoffman et al., 2006; NASA, 2004; Swieringa et al., 2014). The results of this simulation had\\nmore speed compliance and more positive replies for the min+ tool set, and the graphical\\nprogress indicator was reported as useful. The implementation in this simulation was directly driven by requirements available in DO-361\\n(RTCA, 2015a). While it proved useful to have these requirements, they were found to be in\\nerror (based on the use in this simulation)22. The result was that the bounds defined and used in\\nthis simulation flagged infeasible operations more than was intended by DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a).\\nThis caused the flight crew to see operations flagged as infeasible and then return to feasible.\\nThis likely led to confusion about whether the operation was infeasible or not and what action\\nto take. Not knowing what action to take was present in past simulations too (e.g., Bone et al.,\\n2008a; Baxley et al., 2016). These issues likely led to questioning of what operations were\\nfeasible and whether the graphical progress indicator should be a minimum. Therefore, the\\nfollowing are recommendations related to the graphical progress indicator. The graphical progress indicator is believed to be a useful feature and likely a minimum\\nrequirement. It should be designed to support pilot trust and an accurate mental model. It\\nshould avoid providing information that causes the flight crew to try to out-guess or\\noverride the IM algorithm and the associated IM speeds. It should provide clear indications\\nof infeasible operations. It should not require excessive monitoring and should include\\nfeatures that reduce monitoring (e.g., spacing error trend information and out-of-tolerance\\nalerting [as seen in implementations like Hoffman et al., 2006]). To determine the best\\ndesign, it should be studied further in future simulations in nominal and off-nominal\\nsituations after setting the feasibility threshold to the corrected values. o For a non-graphical progress indicator as required per the minimum in DO-361\\n(RTCA, 2015a), similar topics should be examined. For example, clear indications of\\ninfeasible operations may be more important with only numerical values. The information provided in the speed tape is also considered to be a key set of information\\n(i.e., the relationship between the IAS, MCP speed, and IM speed). Such information has been\\ndisplayed or required in much past research (e.g., Hoffman et al., 2006; Bone and Long, 2014;\\nLatorella, 2015). Consideration should be given and further research should be conducted to determine\\nwhether this information is a minimum requirement and whether it should be in the\\nprimary field-of-view. 22 The requirements in DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a) are being updated to fix the error. 6-6 6.4 Communications\\nWhile the IM clearances were generally found to be acceptable, controllers did report some\\nconcerns with the achieve-by clearance types and the amount of information in them. Efforts should continue to examine ways to keep the clearance concise. Attention\\nshould also be paid to the amount of lead aircraft IFPI shared in the clearance. This\\nsimulation only had one element (the name of the arrival procedure). If the clearances are\\nas concise as possible, past work has found the use of an advanced organizer such as\\nInterval spacing clearance available, advise when ready to copy has been well received by\\npilots (Bone and Long, 2014) and controllers (Callantine et al., 2012). A few pilot requests\\nfor such a communication were noted in this simulation. While the use of lead aircraft identification was included in the simulation, it was not fully\\nexercised with potentially confusing call signs and the use of the participant aircraft\\nidentification in IM clearances. However, no issues were identified and pilots reported they had\\nthe necessary information to detect and select the lead aircraft. 6.5 Benefits\\nPairs of aircraft conducting IM, as expected, had half the spacing variance of non-IM pairs at the\\nFAF. However, IM and non-IM pairs had the same spacing error at the FAF. To take advantage of the reduced variance seen and expected with IM operations, the\\nappropriate reduction in the spacing buffer used by TBFM for IM aircraft should be\\ndetermined. 7-1 7 References\\nAbbott, T.
