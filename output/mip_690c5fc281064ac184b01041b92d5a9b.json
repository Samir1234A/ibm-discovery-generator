  "text": "the M and SD computations. Responses were variable, but a majority (86%) of Week 2-3 TRACON controllers agreed they had \\nsufficient time to make a first assessment of IM PA pair separation for the Combined Monitor \\nposition with the IM PA Tools On (M=79.0; SD=32.2). The controller that disagreed commented \\nthat the WSL should be displayed sooner. Responses were also variable for the majority (71%) lv\\n of controllers that agreed with the IM PA Tools Off (M=74.3; SD=33.9). The two controllers that \\ndisagreed both commented that the WSL should be displayed sooner (one was the same \\ncontroller in both cases). No practical differences were observed between the IM PA Tool \\nconfigurations. For the 28R Monitor position, responses were variable, but a majority (86%) of Week 2-3 \\nTRACON controllers agreed they had sufficient time to make a first assessment of IM PA pair \\nseparation for the Combined Monitor position with the IM PA Tools On (M=84.1; SD=33.4). The \\ncontroller that disagreed commented that the WSL should be displayed sooner. Responses \\nwere also variable for the majority (71%) of controllers that agreed with the IM PA Tools Off \\n(M=73.7; SD=37.7). The two controllers that disagreed both commented that the WSL should be \\ndisplayed sooner. For the 28L Monitor position, responses were variable, but a majority (86%) of Week 2-3 \\nTRACON controllers agreed they had sufficient time to make a first assessment of their \\nseparation for the Combined Monitor position with the IM PA Tools On (M=83.9; SD=29.8). The \\ncontroller that disagreed commented that the WSL should be displayed sooner. A majority \\n(71%) of controllers also agreed with the IM PA Tools Off (M=82.0; SD=22.8). One of the two \\ncontrollers that disagreed commented that the WSL should be displayed immediately. Responses were variable, but the majority (90%) of Week 2-3 TRACON controllers agreed with \\nthe Data Block CSL Distance On / WSL-P Off (M=78.1; SD=32.7) and Data Block CSL Distance Off / \\nWSL-P On (M=85.3; SD=29.1) configurations. The same controller disagreed in both cases and \\ncommented that the WSL should be displayed sooner. Due to the high variability in the responses no differences were observed between any of the \\nIM PA Tool and monitor configurations. Selected open-ended comments for this question included: (NCT Combined / Tools On) I watched prior to becoming my responsibility, so I was able \\nto have an idea of what was happening.\\n(Non-NCT TRACON / Tools On) It was quick and easy to see the CSL line and A/C target \\nlocation with one quick glance. --------------------------------- At the end of each run (QT1), controllers were asked with the IM PA-related tools provided in \\nthis scenario, I could easily assess the separation between the IM Trail Aircraft and its Lead, \\nwhen they were my responsibility. Their responses were then examined with respect to IM PA \\nTool configuration. Response Means and Standard Deviations are summarized in Table 5-34. \\nScale responses are shown in Figure 5-43. Only TRACON controller responses were included in \\nthe analysis. This question also only applied to controllers responsible for 28R, so the Separate \\n28L Monitor position results are not included. The 28R Final controller results are included as \\nthey were responsible for assessing separation before they transferred the IM Trail Aircraft to \\nthe Local controller. In this case, results for all three weeks are included as the Final controller \\ntasks were not affected by the scenario issues that affected the Monitor controller tasks. lvi\\n Table 5-34.

With the IM PA-related tools provided in this scenario, I could easily assess the separation \\nbetween the IM Trail Aircraft and its Lead, when they were my responsibility. *Combined Monitor configuration / **28R Monitor configuration\\nNote: o indicates Week 1 TRACON controller responses for reference. These are not included in the M and SD computations for \\nthe monitor configurations. However, they are included in the M and SD computations for the 28R Final controller position. All Week 2-3 TRACON controllers agreed they could easily assess the separation between the IM \\nTrail Aircraft and its Lead with the IM PA Tools On (M=89.9; SD=9.8) for the Combined Monitor lvii\\n configuration. A majority (71%) of controllers agreed with the IM PA Tools Off (M=80.3; \\nSD=23.5). The increased variability for the IM PA Tools Off configuration suggests that at least \\nfor the Combined Monitor position, having the IM PA Tools available may help controllers more \\neasily assess the separation between the IM Trail Aircraft and its Lead. For the 28R Monitor position, a majority (86%) of Week 2-3 TRACON controllers agreed with the \\nIM PA Tools On (M=82.3; SD=21.1). The controller that disagreed commented the WSL should \\nbe displayed sooner. All controllers agreed with the IM PA Tools Off (M=84.4; SD=15.2), \\nthough one commented that A predictive WSL would be an improvement. No practical \\ndifference was observed between the IM PA Tool configurations. For the 28R Final controller position, a majority (90%) of TRACON controllers agreed with the IM \\nPA Tools On (M=84.9; SD=21.7). The controller that disagreed commented the CSL and WSL \\nshould be displayed before the aircraft is cleared. All controllers agreed with the IM PA Tools Off \\n(M=90.3; SD=10.3), though one commented that they would have liked to have seen the \\nautomatic distance displayed. Despite the higher variability in the responses with IM PA Tools \\nOn, no practical difference was observed between the two configurations. All Week 2-3 TRACON controllers agreed with the Data Block CSL Distance On / WSL-P Off \\nconfiguration (M=85.7; SD=16.4). A majority (71%) agreed with the Data Block CSL Distance Off / \\nWSL-P On configuration (M=79.0; SD=25.3). No practical difference was observed between the \\ntwo configurations. Overall, no practical differences were observed between any of the IM PA Tool configurations \\nand positions. However, for the Combined Monitor position, having the IM PA Tools available \\nmay help controllers more easily assess the separation between the IM Trail Aircraft and its \\nLead. Safety Limit Depictions6.5.3\\nThis section examines the acceptability, effectiveness, and usefulness of the CSL and WSL \\nfeatures as implemented. CSL Features6.5.3.1\\nAt the end of Day 2 (QT3), after experiencing the nominal scenarios across all IM PA Tool and \\nmonitor configurations, controllers were asked if the CSL Line and Data Block Distance to CSL \\nfeatures were useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task. Responses are shown for all \\nTRACON (NCT and non-NCT combined) and Tower Only. Response Means and Standard \\nDeviations are summarized in Table 5-35. Scale responses are shown in Figure 5-44. Table 5-35. Controller Responses to CSL Feature Usefulness Participant Experience TRACON Tower\\nCSL Line Sample Size (n) 10 2 lviii\\n Mean (M) 96.2 93.0 Standard Deviation (SD) 5.0  Data Block Distance to CSL\\nSample Size (n) 10 2 Mean (M) 32.9 68.0 Standard Deviation (SD) 27.2  Figure 5-44. The CSL Line and Data Block Distance to CSL features were useful for the overall IM PA \\nmonitoring task. Note: o indicates NCT controller responses. All (100%) TRACON controllers agreed the CSL Line was useful for the overall IM PA monitoring \\ntask (M=96.2; SD=5.0). However, only one TRACON controller agreed the Data Block Distance to \\nthe CSL was useful for the overall IM PA monitoring task (M=32.9; SD=27.2). Another controller \\nneither agreed nor disagreed. --------------------------------- At the end of Day 2 (QT3), controllers were also asked to compare the two CSL features directly \\nby rating their agreement with the statement: If the CSL is shown as a graphic line, the numeric \\ndistance to it in the data block is also helpful. Responses are shown for all TRACON (NCT and \\nnon-NCT combined) and Tower Only. Response Means and Standard Deviations are summarized \\nin Table 5-36. Scale responses are shown in Figure 5-45. Table 5-36. Controller Responses to Helpfulness of CSL Numeric Distance, Given CSL Line Participant Experience TRACON Tower\\nSample Size (n) 10 2 Mean (M) 35.6 57.5 Standard Deviation (SD) 29.1  lix\\n Figure 5-45. If the CSL is shown as a graphic line, the numeric distance to it in the data block is also \\nhelpful. Note: o indicates NCT controller responses. Responses were variable, but the majority (60%) of TRACON controllers disagreed the CSL \\nDistance was helpful, if given the CSL Line (M=35.6; SD=29.1). Three controllers neither agreed \\nnor disagreed. One controller agreed and was the same controller that agreed the Distance to \\nCSL was useful in Figure 5-44. In a comment for a separate question, this controller noted that: \\nThe numbers in the data block gave very good trend information as to what was happening to \\nseparation. Open-ended comments for this question included: (Non-NCT TRACON) Not necessary. Visual indications are often more",
