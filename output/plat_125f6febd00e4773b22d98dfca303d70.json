https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastline_paradox \\nFor fractal objects this relationship fails for integer dimensions\\nThe net effect is that as the scale of the measuring stick decreases, the measure of the object grows without bound\\nTo measure such objects, a fractional dimension is required and that dimension becomes the more important number\\n 1/r N(r)\\n 1 1\\n 2 4\\n 4 16\\n 8

bounded by a cone proportional to time t raised to the power 0.5\\nFractional Brownian Motion is also governed by a single value, but H is not restricted to 0.5\\nValues of H closer to 0.0 produce rougher paths, while values closer to 1.0 give smoother values\\nThus H statistically quantifies the sample path\\n| 5 |\\nTime Series and Other Plots Can Also Be Fractal (i.e., Statistically Self-similar Across Scales) Source: http://cs.mcgill.ca/~tredda/brownian.html Standard Brownian Motion In multifractals, the points exhibiting a single value H are scattered throughout the object\\nIn between are points exhibiting different values of H\\nAt different moments q the fluctuations scale according to the scaling function (tau(q))\\nThe full spectrum of power laws and a relative measure of their prevalence is known as the multifractal spectrum\\nThe multifractal spectrum statistically quantifies the sample path of a multifractal\\n| 6 |\\nMultifractals Generalization of Fractals, One Value H Is Not Enough Apple Stock Price Since IPO\\nDays The multifractal spectrum is a relative measure of the number of fractal processes having the same smoothness (regularity)\\nA measure of the (local) regularity is the Holder exponent : For small , or The number of fractal processes with regularity scales as:\\n, or \\nwhere is the multifractal spectrum\\nAnd we can relate to the scaling

parameter estimated from polynomial regression at different scales\\nWavelet methods equate the wavelet coefficients to the scaling function, tau(q)\\nBoth approaches rely on mathematical variations of the multifractal formalism that equates something we can compute empirically to the scaling function\\n| 8 |\\nAlgorithms for Extracting the Multifractal Spectrum A Multifractal Algorithm Taxonomy The data is iteratively segmented at different scales s\\nPolynomial regression is applied to each segment\\nThe sum of variance from the regression of each segment F(s) is proportional to the scaling

Accuracy of MF Spectrum Wavelet Leaders more often find a convex spectrum, but can vary wildly from one implementation to another\\nMF-DFA methods appear to fail more often than good Wavelet Leaders implementations, but are perhaps more accurate in the runs that do not fail\\n Preliminary results match theoretical predictions:\\nMF-DFA computation time increases exponentially with length of the

Accuracy, as width of confidence interval, improves with more data\\nResults vary depending on software implementation\\nWavelet Leaders is consistently better than other algorithms\\n| 14 |\\nAlgorithm Comparison Preliminary Results Accuracy of the Spectrum Peak The degree of multifractality is related to the width of the spectrum\\nThis is proportional to the 2nd derivative of tau(q)\\nNumerical estimations are prone to more error in general\\nWavelet Leaders is again a consistently more accurate approach\\n| 15 |\\nAlgorithm Comparison Preliminary Results Accuracy of the
