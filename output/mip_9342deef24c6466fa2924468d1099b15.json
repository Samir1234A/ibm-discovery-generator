  "text": "Local controllers were made aware that IM Speeds were only provided up to \\nthe IM PTP, which was co-located with the FAF. The Assigned Spacing Goal would have been \\ncalculated to ensure separation was maintained during compression between the FAF and \\nrunway. However, the Monitor controller(s) still had to monitor with respect to the safety limits \\nuntil the IM Lead Aircraft crosses the threshold. WSL monitoring was no longer needed once the \\nIM Lead Aircraft crossed its runway threshold. All IM PA monitoring tools, including alerting, \\nwere suppressed at this point. Under nominal IM PA operations, flight crews were not required \\nto inform controllers that they were no longer following IM Speeds as they crossed the PTP/FAF. Simulation Phraseology5.4.5\\nThe HITL assumed that Feeder Controllers informed the aircraft which approach to expect and \\nprovided the initial communication as part of a Partial IM Clearance. Therefore, the simulation \\nphraseology was only applicable to the (28R) Final controller and Monitor position(s). \\nParticipants were provided the phraseology below to use during the experiment. Non-IM PA Aircraft Approach Clearance:\\nFinal Controller: Aircraft 123, maintain 6000 until established. Cleared RNAV 28R \\napproach. Partial IM Clearance Assigned Spacing Goal Message:\\nFinal Controller: Aircraft 123, spacing goal [x] seconds behind Aircraft 456. IM Trail Aircraft Approach Clearance:\\nFinal Controller: Aircraft 123, cleared RNAV PAPA 28R approach. IM PA Off-Nominal Termination, Flight Crew Unable:\\nAircraft 123: ATC, unable interval spacing.\\nATC: Aircraft 123, terminate interval spacing. [Instructions] IM PA Off-Nominal Termination, Controller Initiated:\\nATC: Aircraft 123, terminate interval spacing. [Instructions] Experimental Design5.5\\nThis section describes how the HITL experiment was conducted, including detailed research \\nobjectives, participants, traffic files, scenario matrices, and the run order and data collection \\nstrategy. xxxi\\n Objectives5.5.1\\nBased on the research questions and hypotheses described in Section 3.3, the experimental \\ndesign addressed the following seven objectives: Examine overall acceptability of monitoring nominal IM PA operations, in both 1.\\nCombined and Separate Monitor configurations. Examine acceptability of the following IM PA Tools: IM Spacing List, Data Block IM 2.\\nStatus, CSL/WSL Line Displays, Predictive and Caution Alerts, Lateral Boundaries and \\nExceedance Warning. Examine usefulness of potentially optional IM PA tools: WSL-P and Data Block Distance 3.\\nto CSL/WSL display. Examine the effect of decreasing the alert timing values: ATPA Timing, plus two 4.\\nadditional Timings. Examine the acceptability of the IM PA Tools with respect to two off-nominal conditions: 5.\\nSpacing Loss, IM Lead Aircraft Deviations. Examine the impact of display type, monitor configuration, and Lateral Boundaries on 6.\\nthe lateral monitoring task. Examine feasibility and acceptability of using Partial IM Clearance procedures to initiate 7.\\nan IM PA operation. The design strategy to collect data to evaluate these is described in the following sections. Participants5.5.2\\nParticipant controllers were coordinated through the FAA and National Air Traffic Controllers \\nAssociation (NATCA) using standard procedures. Controllers were compensated for their \\nparticipation through standard FAA processes. Twelve certified and current terminal area \\ncontrollers with at least three years of experience in parallel runway approach operations were \\nrequested. This included at least two from NCT per week, each with at least three years \\ncertification in Area B. The request also asked that no one with prior MITRE PA simulation \\nexperience should be included. Twelve currently certified controllers participated in the simulation. Four of the controllers were \\nfrom NCT and had experience in the area being simulated (Area B). Eight of the controllers were \\nfrom other terminal facilities with parallel runway approach operations. Including those from \\nNCT, eight of the twelve participants were current TRACON Approach Controllers. Two of the \\nparticipants were currently Tower controllers, but had TRACON experience. Due to a \\nmiscommunication related to the request, two participants only had Tower experience. These \\ntwo controllers were provided extra training on the separation tasking and their results were \\nusually pooled separately. The TRACON controllers and Tower controllers with TRACON experience had an average age of \\n37.1 years and on average actively controlled traffic for 13.75 years (with a minimum of 9 years \\nand a maximum of 26 years). The two Tower-only controllers had an average age of 33.5 years \\nand had controlled traffic for 8.5 and 11 years. xxxii\\n There were four non-participant roles. Two pseudopilots controlled and responded as all \\naircraft. Two confederate controllers served as Local controllers. Simulation Schedule, Procedures, and Controller Training5.5.3\\nThe HITL was conducted over three weeks. Each week involved the four participant controllers \\nparticipating in a 3-day simulation session. The schedule was based on a repeated-measures \\nexperimental design, intended to maximize experimental power by having every participant \\nexperience each experimental condition from each position. Each weekly session consisted of three self-contained experiments. The first, which occurred \\nover Days 1 and 2, examined normal operations with combined versus separate Monitor \\ncontrollers. The IM PA tools were also varied to examine their relative usefulness. The first day \\nbegan with a pre-simulation briefing, which covered the PA concept, the simulation \\nenvironment (i.e., airspace, traffic, separation, and other procedures), controller roles and \\nresponsibilities (as described in Section 4.4), and the overall schedule and conduct of the \\nsimulation. Controllers were also After that, controllers were brought into the lab and given a \\npractice scenario that allowed them to familiarize themselves with the workstation and \\nsimulation-specific procedures, including initiating, monitoring, and terminating IM PA. \\nControllers were also provided a summary sheet with key procedures (such as responses to off-\\nnominal conditions) and communications frequencies. Following the training, controllers started \\nthe data collection scenarios. Day 2 started with a shortened training briefing that summarized the IM PA concept \\ninformation from Day 1 and introduced new procedures for the roles the participants would be \\nassuming that day. Controllers were again provided a practice scenario that allowed them to \\nfamiliarize themselves with the new procedures and tasks. As with Day 1, controllers began the \\ndata collection scenarios directly following the training. The third day of each session consisted of two separate, self-contained evaluations. The first, in \\nthe morning, examined different longitudinal alert timing values. The second, in the afternoon, \\ntook an initial look at lateral monitoring and introduced IM Lead Aircraft and IM Trail Aircraft \\ndeviations that exceeded the Lateral Boundaries. Each evaluation was preceded by a short \\ntraining briefing that described the new aspects of the scenarios they would be working and \\nreviewed key procedures. For the Alert Timing scenarios, controllers were informed what the \\nnew alert values would consist of. For the lateral monitoring scenarios in the afternoon, \\ncontrollers were reminded of the procedures to manage these off-nominal deviations. Training \\nscenarios were not provided for either as the traffic and controller position configurations were \\nthe same as they had already experienced in Days 1 and 2. Each run for all three days was followed by a short questionnaire asking for controllers to rate \\ntheir experience in that scenario across a variety of metrics. A final questionnaire was provided \\nat the end of Day 1 asking about their experience across all the scenarios they experienced that \\nday. A different final questionnaire was provided at the end of Day 2 and consisted of two parts. \\nThe first asked controllers to rate their experiences for only the scenarios they experienced on \\nDay 2. A second part then asked controllers to rate their experiences across both Days 1 and 2. \\nFor Day 3, in addition to the post-run questionnaires, final questionnaires were provided at the \\nend of each of the two evaluations (i.e., Alert Timing and Lateral Deviations) asking them to rate xxxiii\\n their experience across all the scenarios for that particular evaluation. A Day 3 final \\nquestionnaire was also provided at the end of Day 3 which asked controllers to rate their \\nexperiences across all the scenarios for all three days. After that, controllers were invited into a \\nconference room for a discussion and debrief. Some questions were prepared to guide the \\ndiscussion, but controllers were also invited to provide feedback on any topic or aspect of the \\nsimulation they wished. As shown in the daily schedules in Figure 4-34, the four participants were divided into a Pair \\nA and a Pair B for each of the three days. Each scenario involved only two participants at \\na time. Therefore, two participants filled out their post-run questionnaires while the \\nother two ran the scenario. Figure 4-34. Daily Schedules Independent Variables5.5.4\\nIndependent variables were chosen to test the hypotheses described in Section 3.3 and the \\nmore detailed research objectives listed in Section 4.5.1 including Number of Monitor \\ncontrollers, selected PA Tools, alert timing values, and display type. The independent variables \\nand associated levels of each are shown in Figure 4-35. xxxiv\\n Figure 4-35. HITL Independent Variables and Levels For both the Day 1 and Day 2 Nominal scenarios and the Day 3 Lateral Monitoring and Deviation \\nscenarios, the Number of Monitor controllers was varied as an Independent Variable. Some \\nscenarios involved a single, Combined Monitor controller assuring separation for traffic arriving \\nto both 28L and 28R. Other scenarios involved Separate Monitor controllers managing the \\ntraffic only on their respective approach. For the Day 1 and Day 2 Nominal scenarios, the WSL-Display and the Data Block CSL/WSL \\nDistance Display were made to be Independent Variables and were either",
