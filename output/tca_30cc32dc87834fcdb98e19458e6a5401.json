  "text": "a description of the effects of those risk factors. Such an assessment is \\ncrucial for risk management; by enabling risk awareness, risk mitigation, and risk-based decision \\nmaking. \\nA variety of risk assessment methods exist, across many industries [1], [2]. These methods all \\nhave the same basic steps in common: Determine what can go wrong1.\\nDetermine how often this happens2.\\nDetermine the extent of the consequences3.\\nDetermine if the assessed risk is acceptable4. Methods to perform the risk assessment vary widely across industry domains. Furthermore, even \\nwithin the same domain, the risk assessment can take different forms which may differ in \\ndimension. A primary driver of model design is the desired output: Will risk be expressed as a \\nnumerical value as a function of probability? Or will the risk be expressed as a qualitative term \\nexpressed linguistically or as a relative index on a normalized rating scale? This first design \\ndecision drives the selection of model expression (quantitative versus rule-based), and model \\ninputs (quantitative versus qualitative data).\\nRegardless of methodology, risk is the probability of an undesired outcome with the severity of \\nthat outcome. Risk (R) is the Probability (P) of Severity (S) Risk Assessment Model Dimensions / Evaluation Criteria2.1\\nIn evaluating risk modeling for airworthiness assessments, there are several dimensions along \\nwhich comparisons may be made, as indicated in the following list. There is no order or \\nweighting of these criteria. Nor are these criteria the only basis for the final recommendation. How is the risk model expressed? \\nWhat kind of input data feeds the approach?\\nWhat kind of output is produced? Additional metrics for model implementation evaluation include: Complexity of model\\nIntended use (as designed)\\nDecision support automation\\nRisk areas covered Risk to pedestrians on the ground-\\nRisk to other aircraft- ii\\n Risk of penetration of sensitive/restricted areas-\\nRisk due to human error (whether in planning, controlling, responding to -\\nunforeseen/adverse conditions) Model Expression2.1.1\\nModel expression refers to the formalism used to encode the risk computation. This may take the \\nform of fault and event trees [3], [4], mathematical formulations [5], risk matrices [6], rule-based \\napproach [7], or some combination of these and others [8]. Choice of representation is dependent \\non intended use and available data. \\nQuantitative models enable rapid exploration of input parameters. Trials (what-if tests) are easy \\nand inexpensive to run, replicate, and quantify. Probabilistic distributions of input parameters can \\nbe randomly sampled to explore the interactions among inputs, and results (e.g., most likely \\noutput).\\nQualitative models emphasize representation of a maximal set of risk factors. Presentation of \\nnumerical input and output of a model may take various formats such as formulas, look-up tables, \\nflow charts, and risk matrices. The rules which combine inputs are typically knowledge-driven, \\nmeaning that they are derived from subject matter expert knowledge elicitation instead of \\nformulas. Input Data2.1.2\\nRisk models vary in their data requirements. Input data can range from precise quantification of \\nrisk factor probabilities and probabilistic distributions to subjective assessments, expressed on a \\nnumerical scale, or a descriptive term (such as low and high). For example, the probability of \\na component failure may be expressed quantitatively as a point probability (e.g., 110-5) or as a \\nprobabilistic function (e.g., a normal distribution around a mean value). A qualitative reliability \\ninput may be expressed as very reliable.\\nQuantitative models will depend on quantitative data to compute a quantitative output, while \\nqualitative or non-numerical data can be used only by qualitative methods (e.g., rule-based \\nmodels). Outputs2.1.3\\nRisk model output is motivated by demands of the assessment problem and constrained by the \\nmodeling methodology and input data. Methods which produce a quantitative expression of the \\nseverity of a hazard, in conjunction with its probability of occurrence, are referred to as \\nquantitative methods.\\nInterpretation of a quantitative risk model output, probability of severity, is straightforward. For \\nexample, probability of an adverse effect during a particular time period, such as probability of \\nsUAS failures in one flight hour. Severity in this example relates sUAS failures to fatalities. \\nQuantitative models can be validated over time based on actual event statistics, however, this is \\nproblematic for rare events. As a substitute, the input probability of relatively more common \\nadverse events can be refined (e.g., motor failure). The model algorithm, how output is calculated \\nbased on input, can also be challenged and reevaluated by various researchers until a safe \\nconsensus is achieved. \\nQuantitative modeling can use both statistical and deterministic parameters to represent real iii\\n world situations. These values can be presented in various formats such as graphs, equations, \\ndiagrams, scatterplots, and tree diagrams. The model provides an abstraction that reduces a \\nproblem to its essential characteristics. The model describes, in a quantifiable way, the impact of \\nthe inputs on the output. Inputs represent parameters which can be determined, measured, or \\ndescribed probabilistically and the output is similarly numerical or probabilistic. \\nQuantitative risk assessment is sometimes also known as probabilistic risk assessment. The goal \\nis to use quantitative data (measurable, comparable) to support an evaluation whose result is a \\ncalculated expression of the severity of a hazard in conjunction with its probability of occurrence. \\nThere are various understandings and definitions of risk. [2], [9]. \\nProbabilistic risk assessment uses data to develop a probability distribution of risk. This enables \\nthe evaluation of input data variability and uncertainty and its effect on the risk assessment. Strengths and Weakness of Quantitative Modeling2.1.4\\nThe openly shared algorithm is the main strength of a quantitative approach to risk assessment. Increased model clarity: inputs and outputs are explicit\\nComparability\\nRepeatability\\nAutomation, modeling and simulation A risk model which shares its algorithm description is clear and comprehensible in the sense that \\nit specifies exactly how the inputs of the model are determined or measured. The formal \\nexpression relating the input parameters to the output can be verified by other researchers. \\nFor the same inputs, the model will always generate the same output. Because of this \\nconsistency, it is easy to compare model outputs under different conditions. Changes in output \\nare due only to changes in measurable input variables. Finally, a quantitative model with a clearly \\ndefined range of determined or measured inputs is programmable and can be run automatically to \\nsupport various modeling and simulation strategies, such as Monte Carlo methods.\\nIn contrast, the weaknesses of quantitative modeling are: The quality of the output is only as good as the quality of the input\\nNarrower scope of available features, since data is required to support probabilities\\nIt may ignore some important qualitative (non-quantifiable) differences for simplicity\\nIt may blur a desired distinction between high probability, low severity events, and low \\nprobability, high severity events (which may have the same risk score) A qualitative feature must be given a scale of numeric values (e.g., 1= Strongly Agree, 5= \\nStrongly Disagree). Not all qualitative features are amenable to this mapping, which can restrict \\nthe inputs. As such, in situations where the process to be modeled is incompletely understood or \\nspecified, model expressivity is lost and the model will be incomplete. Assumptions may be \\nneeded to fill in the unquantifiable aspects. Reducing a complex process into a simple equation \\nmay risk losing important distinctions. For example, events A and B may appear to have equal \\nrisk, when the product of the high likelihood and low severity of event A may be equal to the low \\nseverity and high likelihood of event B. iv\\n Knowledge-Driven Risk Assessment2.2\\nIn a knowledge-driven system, risk inference methods are based on variables, rules, and \\nrelationships derived from subject matter experts. Although a qualitative process may be \\nformalized and rigorous, it does not necessarily require a precise algorithm. The dominant feature \\nof such models is that input data may be qualitative, reflecting inputs which are not measurable \\nquantities, and output is qualitative. Output may be a risk classification, or relative risk index on \\nsome scale (such as 1 to 10). Qualitative inference methods may include matrices relating \\nlikelihood categories and severity categories to risk, such as the FAAs safety system \\nmanagement (SMS) risk matrix [6]. Other methods include event and fault trees, rule-based \\nsystems, and various combinations of such methods. Strengths and Weaknesses of Knowledge-Driven Assessment2.2.1\\nThe risk value inference process is a logical and repeatable process, which can consider a very \\nbroad range of risk and mitigation factors. For instance, in the SORA process, the guidance \\nindicates that more than 100 inputs are required for the risk assessment. At least 40 of the \\nrequisite inputs are quantifiable, measurable parameters, such as aircraft dimensions and mass. \\nOther inputs are qualitative (e.g., high/medium/low) and free text (e.g., name of aircraft design \\norganization). \\nThe breadth of inputs required for SORA indicate the span of the risk assessment. If a system is \\nmanufactured by a well-established company and undergoes regular maintenance and \\nconfiguration management, the risk may be assessed to be less than for a new applicant.\\nA knowledge-driven risk assessment is generally more labor-intensive and complex. There are a \\nseries of required steps, most of which are manually derived. Although the model is a logical and \\nrepeatable process, the complexity of input parameters entails a significant amount of subjectivity \\nby the assessor. i\\n Risk Modeling for Small UAS Airworthiness Assessment3\\nModeling sUAS mission risk, in terms of",
