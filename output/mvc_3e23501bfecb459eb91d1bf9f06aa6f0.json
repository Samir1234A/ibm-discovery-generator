McLean, VA January 2020 AWS GovCloud Resource and Cost Analysis \\n ii iii Executive Summary \\nThis technical report outlines many of the most impactful principles and techniques for reducing the cost of hosting a program on Amazon Web Services (AWS) GovCloud. In full production, cloud-hosted IT systems have the potential to incur significant annual costs associated with operation and maintenance, so in order to optimize resource allocation and achieve significant cost savings, the Program Management Office (PMO) should leverage cost-saving techniques and services which are designed to complement AWS dynamic cloud environment. PMOs can realize cost savings and institute effective cost management practices by focusing on three areas: deployment strategies, cost management tools, and programmatic best practices. The scope of these considerations includes both architecture design decisions as well as the integration of services to improve the PMOs insight into billing. To validate the cost saving techniques outlined in this technical report, a proof of concept was performed using a prototypical AWS DevSecOps account. The account currently costs an estimated $7,059 per month, whereas by applying the principles, the estimated bill was reduced by 43% to $4,001 per month while maintaining identical functionality. Because EC2 and RDS instances account for 97% of the bill for the example DevSecOps account, the majority of the implemented cost saving techniques were related to EC2 and RDS instances. Not all of this reports cost saving techniques could be applied to a typical DevSecOps account, but should be considered nonetheless. Focusing on the compute cost component, one of the most practical and effective techniques for the PMO to reduce annual costs is the utilization of Reserved Instances, which offer significant discounts based on time commitment and payment method, instead of On-Demand Instances. To understand the potential cost savings of using a Reserved Instance, a calculation was performed for a representative instance of a typical program (a Linux c5.xlarge EC2 instance in the GovCloud US-EAST region). Figure 1 Cost Comparison of On-Demand and Reserved Instances As demonstrated in Figure 1, the PMO can immediately realize cost savings of 37% by switching to one-year Reserved Instances, or 60% by switching to three-year Reserved Instances. Even further cost savings can be achieved with other tools such as auto-scaling groups. 149.33 149.33 149.3394.17 89.37 87.8459.13 55.22 51.

In a cloud-hosted IT stack, many of the technical components of the programs system may be hosted in Amazon Web Services (AWS) GovCloud. In full production, there are often significant costs incurred by utilizing GovCloud services. With the large volume of services being used to create the programs IT system, it is imperative to evaluate their use in a dynamic and scalable cloud environment to ensure maximum cost effectiveness while maintaining full operational capability. The scope of this paper is limited to data and applications hosted in GovCloud and does not address cost optimization for systems hosted outside of GovCloud, including external data transferring into or out of GovCloud. Although many government programs run solely in GovCloud regions, the paper may include tools and services which have not yet been released in GovCloud regions at this time. There is usually a delay before AWS services for publicly available regions are accredited and become available for use in GovCloud. This technical report is broken into three themes of cost optimization: cost deployment strategies, cost management tools, and programmatic best practices. The cost deployment strategies sections discusses nine AWS recommended management strategies to limit the costs associated with running instances in the cloud environment. The cost management tools section defines the AWS services available to implement these cost-management strategies. Finally, the programmatic best practices defines recommended actions to introduce and maintain a cost- effective cloud environment to an organization. The report culminates in an evaluation of an sample GovCloud DevSecOps environment and how the utilization of these management strategies can significantly reduce program costs. 9 Optimize for the Cloud \\nIn a traditional datacenter environment, teams were limited to either design architectures within the constraints of existing hardware or request additional resources, which is often an arduous task. Datacenter procurements require the purchase of enough servers to support an application during peak hours, which results in a misallocation of resources while equipment sits idle during non-peak hours. The cloud is fundamentally different from a traditional datacenter in that it offers virtually unlimited scalable capacity with tremendous opportunity for increased design flexibility. In the cloud cost model, one only pays for the resources one uses. In order to maximize the benefits of hosting systems in a cloud environment, cloud-based applications should be architected in a method that is appropriate and economical for the environment it is hosted in. This operating model requires an IT strategy which is cloud conscious. 2.1 AWS GovCloud AWS GovGloud regions are isolated cloud regions of Amazon Web Services for workloads with direct or indirect ties to U.S. Government functions or services. All customers who use GovCloud must either be Government organizations or other approved private entities in Government-related industries such as Aerospace, Law Enforcement, and Healthcare. Currently there are two GovCloud regions, US-West and US-East. The regions are physically located in the United States and are designed to allow U.S. government agencies and customers to move sensitive workloads into the cloud by addressing their specific regulatory and compliance requirements, including Federal Risk and Management Program (FedRAMP), High Department of Defense Security Requirements Guide (DoD SRG), Impact Level 5, and Criminal Justice Services (CJIS). 10 Cost Optimization AWS Deployment Strategies \\nThis section of the technical report describes cost-saving strategies and practices for resources deployed in an AWS cloud environment. While many of the concepts described in this section are cloud-provider agnostic, the exact tools discussed are AWS-specific. Nine strategies discussed in this section include: Reserved Instances: instances set in advance at a discounted rate \\n Spot Instances: instances that can be bid on and will run until cost exceeds bid price \\n Auto Scaling and Automating Elasticity: scaling instances based on volume demand \\n S3 Object Lifecycle Management: storage type changes by object lifecycle and access frequency Instance States and Stopping Instances: billing only occurs during running states \\n Tagging: labels applied to resources to maintain visibility for cost management \\n AWS Config: change management of AWS resource configurations \\n AWS Organizations: managing policies and monitoring of all AWS accounts within an organization EC2 Right Sizing: appropriately sizing EC2 instance type and size based on usage \\ndemand 3.1 Reserved Instances Many programs workloads on GovCloud have a predictable usage pattern, with consistent downtimes and long term utility. For these stable applications, the PMO can achieve significant cost savings by converting these instances from On-Demand Instances to Reserved Instances. Reserved Instances enable organizations to commit to usage parameters for a specified amount of time (either one year or three years) in exchange for significant cost savings compared to On- Demand Instances. Functionally, Reserved Instances are identical to On-Demand Instances and are available for services including EC2, RDS, Redshift, and more. The discount rate is a",
