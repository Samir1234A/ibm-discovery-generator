  "text": "airspace is influenced by several factors. These \\ninclude the flight schedules; time of the day and seasonal pattern; effect of weather events \\nsuch as thunderstorms, fog, low visibility conditions, wind speed, and direction; temporary \\ncapacity constraints such as construction on a runway or problems with radars; special \\nevents and military operations requiring closure of SUA; changes due to mechanical issues \\nwith aircraft; avionics capabilities of the aircraft; and air traffic control techniques used by \\nthe controllers. Most of these factors and their impact on the traffic flow are not known \\nahead of time. Flight schedules are published in advance; however, they do not include \\ngeneral aviation which makes up approximately 20 percent of U.S. traffic. Moreover, the \\nschedule data does not contain the expected path (trajectories) of the flights, which is \\nneeded for modeling the impact of blocked airspace. For the near-term future (four to eight \\nhours), it is possible to predict flight trajectories based on the filed flight plans and the \\navailable weather and wind forecast. However, in this research, we are targeting predicting \\ntraffic for a relatively long-term time horizon (up to 12 months in future) at a high level of \\ntime granularity (hourly), and for this, there are no clear predictors of the future traffic \\npattern. The approach to predicting traffic used in this research applies heuristic methods to \\nhistorical traffic patterns. Since traffic in the NAS is influenced by several factors that \\ncannot be known in advance, projection estimates are produced as a range of likely low to \\nlikely high values along with the mean, instead of a single value, which is unlikely to be \\naccurate. The model essentially produces an estimate of the range of likely impact of \\nblocking an airspace for the given length of time, based on historical traffic pattern at that \\nlocation. The traffic predictions from this model are encoded in the Route Segment Density map data \\nstructure described earlier, to enable what-if analysis for predicted impact. 15 To summarize, the steps involved in developing this model are:\\nAnalyze the historical traffic of the continental U.S. airspace to uncover traffic patterns. Develop a traffic projection model based on the results of this analysis. Encode the projection model into the Route Segment Density map to enable its use in a what-if analysis paradigm. These steps are described in detail in the sections that follow. To assess the accuracy of the model, its results are compared to an alternate method of \\nprojection. The track data from the years 2011 to 2015 is used to develop the model to \\nproject for the year 2016. Analyze Historical Traffic Pattern in the Continental U.S. Airspace To analyze the historical traffic pattern in the continental United States, three areas of \\nairspace are chosen at different locations, as shown in Figure 8. These areas of airspace \\nspan approximately 100 NM and are oriented across the direction of traffic flow at that \\nlocation, and together are considered to reflect the traffic pattern observed in the \\ncontinental United States. Air traffic within a specific airspace within \\nthe NAS changes from one moment to the \\nnext, and needs to be aggregated by a time \\nunit for analysis. This unit of aggregation is \\na key factor to consider when uncovering \\nhistorical air traffic patterns. For example, \\naggregation could be daily (consider the \\nhistorical behavior of all flights crossing an \\nairspace during a day such as March 1, \\n2016), monthly (consider the historical \\nbehavior of all flights crossing the airspace \\nduring a month, such as March 2016), and \\nso on. The unit of aggregation should be \\nsufficiently granular to capture the traffic \\npattern without being noisy. Flights for the West Airspace (see Figure 8) aggregated daily over years 2010 to 2015 are \\nshown in Figure 9. The chart below appears very noisy and not suitable to uncover traffic \\npatterns. Figure 8. Airspaces Chosen to Proxy the U.S. Air Traffic \\nPattern 16 Figure 9. Flights Aggregated Daily for West Airspace during the Years 2010 to 2015 When aggregated monthly (see Figure 10), the traffic plot appears flat with no pattern. Figure 10. Flights Aggregated Monthly for West Airspace during the Years 2010 to 2015 These results point to a need to consider a unit of aggregation between daily and monthly, \\nthat is at a weekly level. The weekly numbers begin at the start of the year; for example, \\nweek number 1 is the set of the first seven days of the year. Since a set of seven consecutive \\ndays represents all the days of the week, weekly aggregation cancels the effect of day of \\nweek variation and appears to be a good candidate. 17 Figures 11, 12, and 13 show the weekly traffic pattern for the three areas of airspace. The \\ncharts reflect the seasonal traffic trends, especially pronounced in Florida (see Figure 12) \\nand are not noisy. Based on these observations, weekly aggregation is chosen, as it is \\ngranular enough for a pattern discovery without being too noisy. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 Week Number 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 N\\num be\\nr o f I\\nnt er\\nse ct\\nin g \\nFl ig\\nht s Florida Airspace Weekly Flights Intersections Y2010 Y2011 Y2012 Y2013 Y2014 Y2015 Figure 12.

Flights Aggregated Weekly for North-East Airspace during the Years 2010 to 2011 The charts above also indicate that the traffic flowing through the selected areas of airspace \\ndid not significantly change between years 2010 to 2015. A separate analysis revealed an \\naverage yearly growth of 2.75 percent during this time. Based on the analysis above, and because air traffic tends to follow a weekly pattern, the \\nprojection model uses week number and day of the week to correlate historical days to the \\nday to be projected. To capture the past seasonal traffic trend, the model additionally \\nselects same weekday from two weeks before and two weeks after the week of the day \\nbeing predicted from the previous six years (see the shaded section in Figure 12), thus \\nselecting 30 (5 days in each of past 6 years) historical days in total. The distribution of \\ntraffic in the selected historical days is used to arrive at the mean and likely low and high \\nvalues of projected impact. To summarize, steps to project for day Dp, at Hour Hp occurring in Week Number Wp in the \\nyear Yp are: From the previous year (Yp -1), select five historical days from the week numbers Wp-2 a.\\nto Wp+2, which are the same day of the week as Dp.\\nRepeat the above steps for the previous five years (Yp-6) to (Yp-2), to get a total of 30 b.\\nhistorical days.\\nUse distribution of impact for these historical days to project the impact for Dp; 25 c.\\npercentiles and 75 percentiles are used as the low and high bounds and mean as the \\nimpact.\\nHourly impact numbers are based on average impact during the Hour Hp for the 30 d.\\nselected historical days.\\nA multiplication factor of 1.0275 is applied to all metrics to reflect historical grown rate e.\\nof 2.75 percent. For example, the traffic prediction for March 1, 2016, at Cape Canaveral (Tuesday occurring \\nin week number 9) is based on the distribution of the traffic on Tuesdays during week \\nnumbers 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 for the years 2011 to 2015. 19 Predict Future Traffic During Holidays Holidays such as Christmas Day or Memorial Day change the air traffic pattern. Certain \\nholidays, such as Memorial Day and Thanksgiving Day, fall on the same day of the week \\nevery year, and historical traffic patterns can be readily applied to these. Others, such as \\nJuly 4, may fall on a different day of the week every",
