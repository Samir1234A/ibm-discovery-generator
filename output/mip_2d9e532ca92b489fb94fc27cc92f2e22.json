  "text": "approach path to SFO Runway 28R will likely involve a 3 degree angled offset to \\nreduce the risk of a wake encounter6. The offset also permits increasing the space between the \\nIM PA safety limits. As shown in Figure 2-9, the existing SOIA NTZ cannot be directly applied to \\nthe IM PA operation, because the RNAV PA 28R approach path would pass through it. The \\nlateral deviation monitoring task for IM PA and supporting display features implemented for the \\nHITL experiment are described in Section 4.2.8. Figure 2-9. SFO 28R IM PA Approach Path Penetrates SOIA NTZ Automated Terminal Proximity Alert3.3.2.2\\nAutomated Terminal Proximity Alert (ATPA) Phase 1 functionality is available at NCT and would \\nalso be available during IM PA operations. ATPA Phase 1 alert timing served as the basis for the \\ndevelopment of the IM PA monitoring tools and is summarized here for background. The ATPA becomes active in a facility-specified zone along the final, approximately 10 to 12 NM \\nfrom touchdown. When an aircraft enters the zone and meets ATPA eligibility criteria, ATPA \\nbegins monitoring proximity with the aircraft ahead and tracks closure rates to alert the \\ncontroller if a separation violation is predicted to occur. Controllers may toggle the display of a \\ncone ahead of the aircraft which indicates the minimum authorized separation (Figure 2-10). \\nUnder nominal conditions (no alerts), the cone is blue and radiating outward from a trailing \\naircraft with separation limits displayed. In addition, the distance to lead is displayed in the data \\nblock. The cone and the data block distance both turn amber (warning state) when a \\nseparation violation is predicted to occur in 45 seconds. The cone and data block distance turn \\norange (alert state) if a violation is predicted to occur in 24 seconds. xiv\\n Figure 2-10. ATPA Symbology from Bone and Mendolia (2018) ATPA is an important tool at NCT for monitoring separation along final. However, the use of \\nATPA with IM PA, and integration of display features and potential alerting has not been \\nconsidered. Therefore, to avoid a potential confound from tools that may not be well \\nintegrated, the HITL did not include ATPA functionality. However, the IM PA alerting is based on \\nthe ATPA alert construct, as described in Section 4.2.7. NCT/SFO IM PA Monitoring Summary for the HITL 3.3.2.3\\nThe HITL design team made the following eight assumptions with respect to the implementation \\nof the IM PA operation in NCT/SFO airspace. More detail for each can be found in the \\nreferenced sections. The 28R Final controller will initiate IM PA once the Trail Aircraft is established on final, 1.\\nand then transfer it to the Local controller at approximately 15 to 20 NM (see Section \\n4.4.1). IM PA separation responsibility within an IM Trail Aircraft and IM Lead Aircraft will rest 2.\\nwith a Monitor controller, who will monitor all arrival aircraft on their respective Local \\ncontrollers frequency. Monitoring will be required until the IM Lead Aircraft crosses its \\nrunway threshold. This also avoids flight crews being required to make a frequency \\nchange from final to local (i.e., Tower) during the mid or late stages of the operation (see \\nSection 4.4.3.3). The Monitor controller will also provide the appropriate separation between the aircraft 3.\\npairs (see Section 4.4.3.3). Collision protection is assured by taking action if the IM Trail Aircraft is expected to 4.\\nviolate the CSL (see Section 2.2.2). In the event of a lateral flight path deviation by the IM Lead Aircraft, controllers are not 5.\\nrequired to break out the IM Trail Aircraft before the IM Lead Aircraft crosses its path \\n(see Section 4.4.3.2). Monitor controllers will be required to provide separation in the event of a lateral 6.\\ndeviation by any aircraft in their airspace (see Section 4.2.8). The HITL will evaluate the IM PA monitoring task against both Combined 28R/L and 7.\\nSeparate Monitor controller configurations (see Section 4.4.3.3). The HITL will not include ATPA functionality; however, IM PA alerting was based on the 8. Figure reprinted \\nfrom: Bone and \\nMendolia (2018) xv\\n ATPA alert construct (see Section 4.2.7). IM PA Setup at NCT/SFO 3.3.3\\nBased on FAA (2017b), this section summarizes the overall setup and chronology for how an IM \\nPA operation could be scheduled and initiated at NCT/SFO, in both terminal (tactical) and en \\nroute (metering) environments. Chronology and details for the IM PA setup specifically assumed \\nfor the HITL are described in Section 4.3.1. Tactical Setup3.3.3.1\\nTactical IM PA operations are designed to be planned and executed entirely within terminal \\nairspace. RNAV routes connecting to the instrument approach procedure to be used may or \\nmay not be available. In the case of NCT/SFO, the assumption has been that a continuous RNAV \\npath would be available for arrivals to runway 28R (the IM Trail Aircraft) and that vectoring \\nwould be used to deliver the IM Lead Aircraft to 28L. A scenario for a generic tactical IM PA operation is detailed in FAA (2017b). Based on that and a \\nscenario for a tactical operation from the earlier IM PA concept detailed in Stassen, et al. (2013), \\na possible chronology of events for a tactical IM PA operation at SFO could be as follows. First, \\nthe candidate IM Trail Aircraft and IM Lead Aircraft check in on frequency with their respective \\nFeeder Controllers and both aircraft report PFAS. Each Feeder Controller annotates the \\nreported speed in the secondary scratchpad. A Coordinator Controller observes the speeds, \\ncompares flying miles to the runway, and evaluates the speeds for compatibility. If the aircraft \\npair is suitable for an IM PA operation, the Coordinator Controller uses automation or another \\nmethod to compute an Assigned Spacing Goal and then populates the IM Spacing List. The \\nCoordinator Controller then coordinates with the Feeder and Final controllers to ensure that the \\npairings are acceptable. The Feeder Controllers inform the candidate IM Trail Aircraft of the planned IM PA operation, \\nproviding the IM Clearance Type (IM PA) and IM Lead Aircraft Flight Identification. They do not \\nyet provide the Assigned Spacing Goal. The flight crew of the IM Trail Aircraft initializes the FIM \\nEquipment entering the information they have been provided. The Feeder Controllers provide \\nspeed assignments and vectors as necessary to deliver the aircraft to the Final controllers such \\nthat their spacing targets can be achieved. The Woodside (Final Approach) Controller vectors \\nthe IM Lead Aircraft in front of the IM Trail Aircraft, targeting an in-trail spacing between 1 and \\n2 NM. The Foster (Final Approach) Controller provides the IM Trail Aircraft its Assigned Spacing \\nGoal once both aircraft are established on the final approach course, which initiates the IM PA \\noperation. The flight crew of the IM Trail Aircraft enters the Assigned Spacing Goal into the FIM \\nEquipment and begins following the IM Speeds. The Final Approach controllers clear the aircraft \\nfor their approaches and instruct the aircraft to change to the Local controller frequency. \\nMonitor controllers monitor separation with respect to the CSL and WSL (if applicable) until the \\nIM Lead Aircraft crosses its runway threshold. For tactical IM PA operations, terminal automation may be required to: 1) Identify candidate IM \\nTrail and IM Lead Aircraft (possibly through filed flight plans); 2) Calculate an Assigned Spacing \\nGoal based on PFAS inputs; 3) Display IM PA information to Final and Monitor controllers; 4) \\nAccept controller inputs indicating initiation and termination of the IM PA operation. xvi\\n Metering Setup3.3.3.2\\nWhen IM PA is conducted in a metering environment, the aircraft are likely to be scheduled for \\nan IM PA operation while still in en route airspace. TBFM is expected to identify suitable aircraft \\npairs and, optionally, define an IM operation that precedes the IM PA operation to ensure that \\nthe aircraft are delivered to the final approach course with suitable spacing. The required IM \\ninformation is then forwarded to the terminal controllers displays (e.g., STARS), as appropriate. \\nA scenario for an IM PA operation in a metering environment is detailed in FAA (2017b). That \\nscenario suggests a chronology of events associated with IM PA in a metering environment at \\nSFO which includes both IM operations and is summarized below. First, all aircraft landing at SFO report PFAS at an appropriate point in en route airspace. This \\nmay be accomplished using some form of digital communications (e.g., CPDLC), or other means. \\nTBFM captures the PFAS information, assesses the traffic flow, identifies aircraft pairs for IM PA \\noperations, and builds a runway schedule based on IM PA capability. TBFM then creates two IM \\nClearances: (1) an Achieve-by then Maintain clearance that ends when the aircraft arrive on the \\nfinal approach course, and (2) a Pair (PA) IM Clearance that begins when the first clearance is \\nplanned to end. (Alternatively, the Achieve-by then Maintain Clearance could be amended to a \\nPair Clearance by a terminal controller at the appropriate time.) TBFM proposes both IM clearances to the en route controller, who evaluates and accepts the \\nclearances. The en route controller, via voice or CPDLC (if available) sends both clearances to \\nthe IM Aircraft, withholding the Assigned Spacing Goal for the PA IM Clearance.",
