  "text": "P chansp`qu, 1. trAp`q is linearly ordered by ; and 2. trAp`q ordered by is a trace of ltsp`q. {{{ When LO is finite, the well-founded condition is redundant. If A pE,q is an execution, and 1 is a partial order that is stronger than , i.e. 1, then A1 pE,1q is also an execution. The weakest partial order is generated from the sequential traces of the individual locations, and extended to events at other locations when they share an event on some channel that connects them. However, any strengthening of this order determines another execution based on the same set E of events. Our notion of execution ignores what states the locations ` reach after en- gaging in the events trAp`q, and thus ignores the effects of nondeterminism. A similar theory can be developed including the resulting states, which would let us talk about refusals as well as traces, but we will postpone that opportunity for now. We have here a synchronous notion of communication; a message m passes over channel c only if both endpoints can take a transition with label c,m. Thus, the sender learns that the recipient is willing to accept m over c now. Information flows over channels in both directions. 3.2 Local Runs and Compatibility We can now define what an observer with access to a particular set of channels sees, or what a source of information does. We will assume that the observer or the source has access to a set of channels C CH. Often C is of the form C chansp`q for some ` P LO or C \\n `PL chansp`q for some L LO, but this is not always the case. A local run at C is just the result of restricting the events in some execution to the channels C. Definition 3. Let B pE,Rq be a partially ordered set of events, and C CH. 1. The restriction B | C is pB0, R0q, where B0 te P E : chanpeq P Cu, and R0 R X pB0 B0q.\\n2. B is a C-run of F iff for some A P ExcpFq, B A | C.\\n3. C-runspFq tB : B is a C-run of Fu. We write C-runs when F is understood, and, when C is understood, we speak of local runs. B2 extends B1, when B1 pE1,1q and B2 pE2,2q are p.o. sets, iff E1 E2; 12 XpE1 E1q; and te : De1 P E1 . e 2 e1u E1. {{{ Fix some frame F . What an observer at D knows is that some B P D-runspFq occurred, since she observed some B. She wants to consider what local runs are still possible at some source D CH. These are the members of D-runspFq that are restrictions of executions that also restrict to B. Definition 4. Let C,D CH and D P D-runs. 1. A local run B P C-runs is compatible with D iff, for some A P Exc, A | C B and A | D D.\\n2. JCDpDq tB P C-runs : B is compatible with Du. {{{ We use the letter J to indicate that these B can occur jointly with D. The subscripts indicate that information would flow from C to D if JCDpDq fails to have suitable closure properties. The subscript D adjacent to the argument D is meant to remind that D P D-runs, as a kind of type-annotation; the left-most subscript C is a reminder of the type of the local runs in the result. 3.3 Blurs to Limit Information Flow Generally speaking, when JCDpDq is large for all D P D-runs, then there is little flow from C to D. The observations at D leave open many possibilities for what could have happened at C. We can make precise what the observer at D cannot learn by considering closure operators on sets of local C-runs. We think of the observers vision as blurred insofar as she cannot distinguish a local C-run from other members of a closed set. Thus, the relation of coarsening on closure operators represents the observers loss of resolution as information flow decreases. Generally speaking, a closure operator obeys three properties. Each set in included in its closure; closure is idempotent ; and closure is monotonic with re- spect to the inclusion relation. We found that information flow respects the graph structure of frames when we strengthen the montonicity property somewhat [4]. We call operators that satisfy these strengthened conditions blur operators. Definition 5. A function on sets is a blur operator iff it satisfies: Inclusion: For all sets S, S pSq; Idempotence: is idempotent, i.e. for all sets S, ppSqq pSq; and Union: commutes with unions: If tSauaPI is a family indexed by I, then p\\n aPI Saq \\n aPI pSaq. S is -blurred iff is a blur operator and S pSq. {{{ Observe that\\n aPI pSaq p\\n aPI Saq is equivalent to monotonicity, so that the union property is effectively monotonicity plus a converse. The union property ensures that is determined by its action on singletons. Since S \\n aPStau, pSq \\n aPS ptauq. Blur operators form a lattice under pointwise inclusion, which provides a way to compare the flow of information in different situations. Thus, allows at least as much information flow as if pSq pSq for every S. The EpiDB blur. In the case of EpiDB, we are interested in a blur on the local runs at channel 3, i.e. C t3u. Since, by the union property, we only need to define ptBuq for singletons of a B P C-runs, we must say which local runs B1 should be indistinguishable from B for the observer on channels 1, 2, i.e. A1. However, Section 2.3 already makes clear which B1 this should be. Analyst A1\\nhas permissions defined in terms of personspA1q, diseasespA1q, and IntpA1q. Define R0pBq to be the set of disease records pp, d, tq delivered in B such that p P personspA1q, d P diseasespA1q, and t P IntpA1q. Define R1pBq to be the set of disease records pp1, d, t1q in B such that there is an encounter record ptp, p1u, eq in B with t, e, t1 successively -near. Then ptBuq tB1 : R0pBq R0pB\\n1q and R1pBq R1pB 1qu We can also express this more operationally: pSq is closed under 1. permutations; 2. adding: (a) records submitted elsewhere in B; (b) encounter records not connecting R0pBq to any disease record in B; (c) disease records rd pp, d, tq such that i. p R personspA1q, d R diseasespA1q, or t R IntpA1q, and ii. rd is not connected to R0pBq by an encounter record; 3. omitting records of the same kinds. Limited flow. The blur notion suggests a restricted information flow notion, and moreover the latter respects the graph structure. Specifically, limiting what information flows to a cut set in the graph guarantees the same limit applies to observers beyond that cut set. Definition 6. Let obs, src CH and : Ppsrc-runsq Ppsrc-runsq. F -limits src-to-obs flow iff is a blur operator, and, for every B P obs-runs JsrcobspBq is -blurred. This notion respects the graph structure of the frame F . First, since effectively information can flow in either direction over a channel, we consider the undi- rected graph ungrpFq pV,Eq where the vertices V are the locations, V LO, and where an undirected edge p`1, `2q exists iff, for some c P CH, sndrpcq `1\\nand rcptpcq `2 or vice versa. Now, for C0, C1, C2 CH, let us say that C1 is a cut between C0 and C1 iff, for every path p through ungrpFq that starts at a c0 P C0 and ends at a c2 P C2, p traverses some c1 P C1. Now: Theorem 1 (Cut-Blur Principle, [4]). Let src, cut, obs CH, where cut is a cut between src and obs in F . If F -limits src-to-cut flow, then F -limits src-to-obs flow. There is also a two-frame version of the same idea. Here, F2 agrees with F1 on the portion of the graph that lies from src to cut, and on the lts of those locations. As\\nlong as F2 does not exercise possibilities at cut that F1 does not, then -limited flow is preserved. We write CHi,LOi, C-runsi, etc. for the channels, locations, local runs etc. of Fi. Theorem 2 ([4]). Let src, cut CH1 in F1. Let F2 be a frame, with src, cut CH2, and such that, if p is any path in ungrpF1q starting at some c0 P src and traversing no arc in cut, and p reaches c P CH1, then: 1. c P CH2, sndr1pcq P LO2, and rcpt1pcq P LO2; 2. sndr2pcq sndr1pcq, and rcpt2pcq rcpt1pcq; 3. lts1psndr1pcqq lts2psndr2pcqq and lts1prcpt1pcqq lts2prcpt2pcqq. Let obs CH2 be such that cut is a cut between src and obs in F2. If cut-runs2 cut-runs1, and F1 -limits src-to-cut flow, then F2 -limits src-to-obs flow. In fact, the cut-blur principle is a corollary of this; when we equate F2 F1,",
