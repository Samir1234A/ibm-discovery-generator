  "text": "and Kopald (2013)\\nalso found non-IM aircraft conformance with their slot markers decreased over the course of\\nthe scenario, though not to the degree seen in this simulation. Although aircraft were often outside of their slot markers and ahead of schedule, the relative\\nposition of the trail aircraft to the lead is important. Overall, the results show few differences\\nbetween IM aircraft and non-IM aircraft based on lead aircraft position relative to its slot\\nmarker. The majority of the time the trail aircraft (IM or non-IM) had the same relative position\\nto its slot marker as the lead aircraft did to its slot marker. While minor differences between IM\\nand non-IM pairs existed when the lead aircraft was behind its slot marker, they appeared\\nminor and were resolved as the aircraft merged at DERVL and arrived at the FAF / YOKXO.\\nOverall, IM and non-IM aircraft met the performance baseline / goals expected for the\\noperations. Aircraft in general being out of the slot markers (yet still relatively close to the schedule) in the\\nfinal controllers airspace, after arriving in the slot markers is logical. The final controllers\\nbecame more concerned with relative spacing of aircraft, as seen in past simulations. For\\nexample, Wynnyk and Kopald (2013) stated that final controllers were more focused on relative\\nspacing / separation and that the slot markers changed from a schedule objective to an on-\\ngoing status indication of whether or not a merge was going to be successful. IM has been\\nconducting relative spacing prior to this point and will continue to do so, thus an IM aircrafts\\nbehavior looks much like the controllers behavior at this point. Final controllers may also be\\nwilling to close up spacing if any gaps exist. Several controllers in this simulation expressed an\\ninterest in closing gaps and landing aircraft as soon as possible, regardless of the schedule. Some past work showed controller concerns with IM aircraft being outside their slot markers\\nlonger than non-IM aircraft (e.g., Cabrall et al., 2012). This was seen in this simulation in the\\nfeeder controllers airspace and most likely due to achieve-by aircraft working toward the ASG\\nthough not as quickly as the controller was getting aircraft into the slot markers for handoff to\\nthe final controller. The majority of controllers in this simulation reported that IM aircraft\\nposition and behavior of an aircraft relative to its slot marker was logical. However, this was\\nfound to be an issue in past simulations and may continue to be noted as problematic because\\nthe controllers task during metering is to get aircraft into their slot markers. The controller may\\nget non-IM aircraft into their slot markers more quickly than IM aircraft that are working to\\nachieve the ASG at a downstream point. There were no controller comments suggesting that candidate IM aircraft should be in their slot\\nmarkers in feeder controllers airspace prior to starting IM (as there were in the concept\\nevaluation activities mentioned in Section 2.4.2.3). There were only five events where the spacing within an aircraft pair was below the separation\\nstandard in the feeder or final controllers airspace. None of the events were for an aircraft\\nactively conducting IM. The specific reasons for the events were unclear. 5-5 5.4 Displays 5.4.1 Controllers\\nControllers were asked about the terminal metering tools, but only in relation to IM operations.\\nThey were also asked about the usefulness of the new IM display elements. Three controller\\ntool sets were examined in this simulation: Basic: TSAS features, the IM clearance window, as well as the IM trail and lead aircraft\\nstatus fields in the data blocks Basic+ cue: The basic tool set plus the slot marker color change (cue) Basic+ cue and prediction: The basic+ cue tool set plus the spacing prediction value\\n(shown in parentheses after the lead aircraft identification in the IM clearance window) Controller replies on the helpfulness of the terminal metering tools for IM and non-IM aircraft\\nwere similar to past results. The ratings were generally positive for both IM and non-IM aircraft,\\nexcept for the early / late indicator (which was not available for IM aircraft) and the timeline.\\nBoth of these had lower ratings and a lot of variability. The early / late indicator was not shown\\nfor IM aircraft, so this result does not suggest an issue with IM or IM integration. This\\nsimulation also did not have any specific events that caused the controller to use the timeline\\n(e.g., schedule disruptions), nor did any results indicate that it caused issues for IM aircraft. The ratings for the terminal metering tools were also generally similar for both IM and non-IM\\naircraft except for the slot markers (without the additional IM cue). Controllers found the slot\\nmarkers (without the additional IM cue) less useful for IM but the responses had a lot of\\nvariability. However, observations indicate the slot markers (without the additional IM cue)\\nwere still important and utilized for IM aircraft. IM aircraft behavior relative to the slot markers\\nwas reported in the previous section. When considering the results for the terminal metering\\ntools, they did not appear to conflict with IM operations and several seemed to provide as\\nmuch useful information for IM aircraft as for non-IM aircraft. Overall, past work such as Cabrall et al. (2012) had similar results as controllers reported the\\nterminal metering tools were useful when controlling IM aircraft and that the slot markers were\\nless usable for IM aircraft. Thipphavong et al. (2013) also had similar results and reported\\ncontrollers found the slot markers, timeline, and speed advisories were useful but less so for IM\\naircraft. When asked about the IM display information in the IM clearance window, the majority of\\ncontrollers reported the IM status information, the spacing prediction / ETA differential, and\\nthe no speed alerting were helpful, as seen in past simulations with several of the elements\\n(e.g., Peterson et al., 2012; Callantine et al., 2013; Thipphavong et al. 2013). Benson et al.\\n(2011) and Peterson et al. (2012) also had controller reports of the spacing prediction / ETA\\ndifferential being useful, but replies were variable as to whether it should be a minimum\\nfeature. For the data block IM elements, trail aircraft and lead aircraft status indicators were reported as\\nhelpful by a majority of controllers, as with past simulations (e.g., Benson et al., 2011; Cabrall et 5-6 al., 2012; Callantine et al., 2012; Callantine et al., 2013). Presenting the status of the lead\\naircraft is not only helpful in understanding aircraft roles, it was found by Thipphavong et al.\\n(2013) to reduce the chance of suspending an IM operation by 20%. The color change of slot markers to blue (aka cue) for trail aircraft actively conducting IM\\nreceived variable responses regarding its usefulness (note these replies are for the same slot\\nmarkers as noted above but this question was for the color change for IM). However,\\nobservations indicate the cue was still important and utilized for IM aircraft (and may help\\navoid accidentally issuing a speed to an aircraft already conducting IM). The cue may be more\\nuseful for controllers who did not initiate IM, and therefore do not have memory of which\\naircraft had been engaged in IM. The cue is the first visual indication of which aircraft are\\nconducting IM when entering the airspace. The cue was introduced for the simulation based on\\nfeedback received during the concept evaluation activities leading up to the simulation. Those\\nindividuals reported the cue as useful and helpful as compared to situations without it.\\nHowever, controllers in this simulation did not clearly report it to be as useful and helpful. For the different controller tool sets, statistical tests found no statistically significant difference\\nbetween tool sets (or controller roles) for the question of being confident the IM aircraft\\nspacing would remain outside the separation requirement. There was also no difference for the\\nquestion of whether they had the necessary display elements. Other data did not reveal clear\\ntrends. However, as mentioned previously, the majority of controllers reported that the spacing\\nprediction / ETA differential was useful while the slot marker cue received some mixed\\nresponses (although comments and observations indicated they were useful). Additional work\\nis likely necessary to continue to determine the necessary controller tools. The currently-fielded ATPA feature was available and utilized in the simulation. Some\\ncontrollers reported issues with the ATPA distance covering the trail aircraft IM status (e.g,\\nT(A)) when aircraft were on final and ATPA was active. They liked the IM information in the data\\nblock and if they did not have the slot marker cue, the only way they knew the aircraft was\\ndoing IM was in the IM clearance window. 5.4.2 Pilots\\nTwo flight deck tool sets were examined in the simulation. The first was termed min and was\\nbuilt to the standards specified in DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a). The second was the min+ tool set\\nthat included two features not required in DO-361 (RTCA, 2015a): the graphical progress\\nindicator and speed tape. IM information was presented on two different displays: the CDTI\\ntraffic display and the AGD. The AGD was the primary display to be used during IM and contained the key information\\nelements. It was expected to be where the pilots primarily focused with an occasional reference\\nto the CDTI traffic display. Pilots reported being able to primarily focus on the AGD while\\noccasionally referencing the CDTI traffic display. Pilots reported the AGD was easier than the\\nCDTI traffic display to integrate into the normal instrument scan. The pilot replies were",
