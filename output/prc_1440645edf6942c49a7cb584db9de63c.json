Figure 3 shows an overview of the LinkBioMan \\nsystem. Refer to Figure 1 for a more detailed view of the decision framework (B in Figure 3).

(B) The decision framework then ingests the input \\nframes and audio buffers, producing results which are saved to (C) the database. (D) The scheduler ensures that \\nthe results from the decision framework are generated at the user-specified rates and synchronized across the \\nframework by controlling the video stream to each of the modules. (E) At run time, users can provide feedback \\non the decision framework output (alert, context and caption) for future module fine-tuning. At system startup, the scheduler dynamically builds the decision framework based on the user-\\nspecified system configuration, assigning separate worker processes to each module. Once \\ninitialization is complete, the video handler transcodes the input video stream and passes the \\ntranscoded frames and audio buffers to the scheduler. The scheduler then brokers and \\nsynchronizes the data streams for the modules, each of which typically processes the data at \\ndifferent rates. Any data queries or stores to the database are also handled by the scheduler, which \\nacts as the mediator among the decision framework, the database and the individual decision \\nframework modules.\\nThe decision framework itself is highly modular and houses the analytical capabilities of the vii system. Individual modules are categorized as either primary or secondary depending on their \\ninput. The input of primary modules is limited to the source data stream, while secondary modules \\nmay receive input from the data stream and other modules. This leads to a hierarchical module \\nstructure where modules further up-stream tend to extract low-level features from the data and \\ndown-stream modules work to fuse these low-level features in meaningful ways, ultimately \\nteasing out higher-level semantic concepts that can be used to alert, provide context to, or describe \\na scene to an operator. The modules, for the most part, rely on pre-trained deep neural network \\nmodels, the details of which are described in Table 2. These modules extract information ranging \\nfrom raw features which are interpretable to a machine (i.e. a vector of floats) to more semantic \\nfeatures such as entities (i.e. detected objects or attributes of objects in a frame) that are more \\neasily interpreted by human beings. \\nIn one of the system user interfaces, there is also an option for users to provide feedback on the \\nsystem performance. The feedback is automatically recorded in the system database and can be \\nextracted later by developers to fine-tune the models. Table 2: LinkBioMan Modules\\nThe table includes information on the input, output, and general description of each of the modules in the \\nLinkBioMan decision framework, which is graphically displayed in Figure 1. The right-most column of the \\ntable, titled Pre-Trained, indicates if the decision framework module is using a pre-trained model. If the \\ndecision framework module is not using a pre-trained model, then the model has been either fine-tuned or \\ntrained from scratch on an external dataset, as noted in the Description column.

All audio processing \\nuses a 1-second analysis window, which is typical for non-speech audio event detection [52]. \\nWhen audio processing is initiated by the Scheduler, the Audio Buffer sends a 1-second audio \\nframe to the Audio Feature Extraction module, that converts the acoustic waveform into feature \\nvectors.\\nTwo feature sets are calculated from the acoustic waveform: VGGish embeddings and cortical \\nfeatures. These two feature sets capture different information from the acoustic waveform, with \\nthe former engineered using deep learning and the latter designed after the responses from cortical \\nneurons in the brain. We incorporate both feature sets as shown in Figure 4. Figure 4: Audio Processing \\n(A) Audio is extracted from the input video, pre-processed, and stored in a 1-second circular buffer. (B) Two \\nfeature sets, VGGish and cortical, are extracted from the audio waveform and sent, along with audio entity \\nprobabilities, to later stages of processing in the LinkBioMan Decision Framework (Refer to Figure 1). The VGGish embeddings are provided by Google [52], so named because their architecture is \\ninspired by comparable features in the visual domain known as VGG. These features are learned x by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a large corpus of audio to capture the \\nvariability present in real-world sound events. The result is a 128-feature vector for 1-second of \\naudio. The cortical features are spectro-temporal features based on the receptive fields of cortical \\nneurons measured in ferret [60]. These features (described in detail in [54]) are calculated by first \\ncomputing the cochleagram, a time-frequency representation (similar to a spectrogram) that \\nincorporates non-linearities present in the mammalian cochlea and auditory periphery. The \\ncochleagram is then filtered using a large bank of two-dimensional Gabor filters spanning different \\ntemporal and spectral modulations. The resulting representation is a 7680-dimensional feature \\nvector.\\nThe VGGish embeddings are sent to the Audio Entity Classification module; VGGish features \\nwere selected in lieu of cortical features after comparison of cross-validation performance. This \\nmodule is composed of a support vector machine (SVM) that outputs the probability that each of \\n73 audio entities is",
